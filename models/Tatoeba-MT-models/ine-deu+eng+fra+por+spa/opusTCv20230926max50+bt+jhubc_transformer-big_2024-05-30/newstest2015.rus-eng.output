FANO Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the National Academy of Sciences will hold the third expert session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editorial board of Lenty.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for conducting the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for conducting the evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a common approach for all three academies to the methodology of evaluation of the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
As a result of the upcoming session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said the head of the expert and analytical management of the FAN of Russia, Elena Aksenova.
Representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia will participate in the event.
Its outcome is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow City, Solyanka Street, House 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among the stars related, that is, originated from a single cluster.
The results of their research have been published in the journal Nature, and they can be briefly found on the university’s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, which precedes the formation of stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of relatives stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The modeling results carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts used a supercomputer to model two streams of interstellar gas that together formed the cloud.
Over the course of several million years, this object under the influence of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added label paints to the initial gas flows and found that a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved thanks to rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to search for stars-related by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carratha police arrested 20-year-old after chasing a high-speed motorcycle
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbara.
A traffic police patrol in Karratha this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle, finding that its speed reaches 125 km/h when it departed from a service station on Batgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued to move along Burgess Road, then rolled into the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person corresponding to the driver's description were spotted near the home at Walcott Way in Bulgarre.
Police in Karratha have accused a 20-year-old man of refusing to stop and dangerous driving.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock at the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
Regarding our responses in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically calculated.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like this time, then we will make decisions about how to respond to it.
This will not be related to knocking on the door, some kind of insult, misunderstood, - the minister stressed.
We will, above all, drift away from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners on their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps that are taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners are pursuing, - the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry continued.
If they say in full voice that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we have to go about it to punish Russia”, it is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO’s tools, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU’s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, anti-dumping measures are applied against the branches of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to engage with WTO mechanisms and in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to properly use cheese in the design of the garden?
The following questions are answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the deer after blooming loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other bushes.
It blends well with many cultures.
And next to the siren, you can and should plant both plants that are decorative at other times and that are blooming at the same time.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, improved bush, bush with a wide base and even the likeness of a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best fits the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted of selling fake money
According to the Republican Ministry of the Interior, the man engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olonetsky and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already inherited in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonetsky District Court.
And to finish the investigation on the crimes committed in our republic, was staged in Segeju.
In the course of the investigation, the guilt has been proven in several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money, relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with a stay in a colony of the general regime.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that last week, two more vendors of fake money were convicted, which were paid by them in the shops of Petrozavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them was deprived of his liberty for five years, the other for four.
Each is fined 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arkhangelsk, the memorial rally was held near the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the embankment of Sedova in Solombal.
Representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class, gathered at the event.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea," said Boris Karpov, chairman of the Veterans Council of the Northern Sea Shipping.
Then the city wind orchestra performed at the event, and the pupils of cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the flag of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers to the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, lead, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrickain fighters, in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the escort convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Out of the 848 ships involved in life-saving caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that protects trade unions as a civil right.
“Where unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is a co-chair of the Progressive Party Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to present the Workers’ Rights Enhancement Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This ground-breaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunities when discriminating against trade unions as it does in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions.
Amendments to the Labour Relations Act to allow workers who are discriminated against for participating in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and penalties - are a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is undoubtedly not a radical initiative – at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are suggesting is to remember the very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization at the same time.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly acknowledged that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim of protecting and improving working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at these ends will be found to be unlawful.
When the former First Lady of Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the organizers had the right to include the guarantee that "the
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to trade unions — and to have this union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to be organized and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and elevated the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as well.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the enhancement of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade unions - has long been ripe.
Keith Allison and John Lewis revive the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed for execution by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginald in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to hospitalize patients within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to act to obtain authority,” Judge John deGravells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within the month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion happily welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to receive hospital authorizations.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from the insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit to suspend the law on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who did not act as plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed such laws, and courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admissions laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion objected that such measures were aimed at protecting women’s health, although some also noted their positive effect on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admissions authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors as long as their applications for admissions authority await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of retail chains should be Russian-made, says Oleg Nilov, Member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia faction.
The parliamentarian prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible inconvenience for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...> For the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of commercial activity in the Russian Federation", the draft law provides for amendments to the Tax Code, setting a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in the trading networks is part of a package of stimulus measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the tax company, Sergei Litvinenko, a member of the independent expert center of the Public Duma, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industry, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
In the plus there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will grow.
In addition, they will be given the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will develop faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” the expert said.
Earlier, Russian companies were often unable to break into the counters of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the imposition of the embargo, this niche has been released and you can breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from the countries of Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will arrive on the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "moment of silence" when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products", - said AiF.ru the first Vice-President of the all-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", H.E. Tamara Kasyanova.
Unambiguously, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector behind local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all items.
And in this situation, the trading networks will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that poor quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in such a situation, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the second, as for the shortage of goods.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was discussed again by economists in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to consider domestic producers when forming orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way of import substitution, and the system of planning production on the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," - says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, the meat production can also receive a powerful impulse.
As you know, the largest share of imports remains per beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still due to Russian products," Kasyanova argues.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate import substitution and can speed up the process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is convinced.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
In addition, there is little to set quotas, it is still necessary to set up the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are exactly such guarantees and will provide,” the expert notes.
Lack of timely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who fast in Australia’s rural areas face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those who live in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research said that the risk of dying during the study was 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
NEEDED SURVEY: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers tracked the medical path of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases, and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Women of older age and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
While the study was not designed to determine why women living outside of cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a timely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of outbound services that will allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Niv, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open in the Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaibelyak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a typical project.
The cost of the work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Head of Public Relations and Information Department, Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and prophylactic institution is almost 230 square meters.
There will be medical care for the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chaskayal.
The new field and obstetric post will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long ago exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will open in the near future.
The murdered four-month-old son in the sober state of the novice boxer will appear in court
A Chuvashia resident will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, an investigation into the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboxarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 of this year, the accused, along with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birth of the child of her godmother in Cheboksary.
After a long dinner, the new-born boxer decided to stay with the guests and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a sober woman laid him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman stumbled upon her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, reports the press service of SU SKR on Chuvashia, sent to court.
Inflation is out of the way.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions between Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not conform to the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the MEP should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the department can lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth of the population's income.
In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation have been predicted?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change,” a source told the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of the food bans will occur together with the possible introduction of sales tax (SST) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual growth rates of prices will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summarized the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced "careful sanctions".
AiF.ru interviewed experts and clarified their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
The price increase is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, as socially significant products became more expensive, the government was forced to launch systemic price stability monitoring measures to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason is initiating the price increase.
The key factors of the growth of the consumer price index continue to remain colossal rates of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imports of goods from countries.
If inflationary pressure had remained under control, the cost of the basket of the minimum set of products would not have jumped by 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on the import of foodstuffs provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a logical increase in final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of an inflationary component.
If we add the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating outlook for economic growth, inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Aleksandr Razuvayev, Director of the Alpari Analytical Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also higher than the current level, another thing that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
At the end of the year, inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of the "Maguta Foundation"
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has been successfully restrained so far, but if further pressure is exerted, primarily on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflation expectations of the population, which are usually manifested in the purchases of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price rises traditionally begin after the summer quiet and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5% is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a drop, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in gardening centers starting to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “primary age of gardening,” according to a study by the HTA.
According to this report, people renting out homes spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving the yards in front of the house for parking, and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of spending on gardener goods on households.
The HTA and the Royal Gardening Society have reported that renting homes and lack of garden space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: “Growing plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail trade in horticultural goods as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather following adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a mass cleaning in the fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the “Earthcare” fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the “Earthcare” fund were replaced as early as Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has only announced the removal from the post of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lazana Vasilyeva.
It turned out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced on Friday.
The deputy executive director Tatyana Angelova, who was previously responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I was not on the board of directors of the fund because we were not legally members of the management, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I cannot say why my resignation is not reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday,” she told Angelova.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of “Investment Lending” in the Central Fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for EU-paid fields.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was head of the regional directorate of the Zemledelie Foundation in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the foundation, Atje Aliyev-Veli, retained his post.
She is currently in charge of the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey’s foreign ministry called on the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification over a report of U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Attorney General and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has underestimated the importance of the message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany’s top intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target for intelligence have sparked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's Biggest Companies Unite Against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the wonder of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
The Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, Wanda Group said in a statement.
It is planned to register a company in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (China’s largest social network, with around 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city on the east coast of China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate revenues of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda is owned by American cinema network AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, the development of which will be handled by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, thanks to the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, Dong Tse said.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest ‘cake’ in online commerce,” said Wanda Wang Jianlin, CEO of O2O.
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation everyone's chances are roughly equal," he said.
The Chinese e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and according to McKinsey & Co., its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg: it is the largest population of any country in the world, except India.
By 2015, this number is expected to grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent Ma Huaten was China’s richest man until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee is now ranked third among China’s wealthiest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is ranked fourth.
“This battle is very interesting to watch: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer ones,” said Bloomberg, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, China.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: “Rome cannot be built in one day.”
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies, but also for the well-deserved leaders of the world of online commerce, is evidenced by the aforementioned report on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something of an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than its two U.S. competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period nearly doubles the same sum of competitors – it grew nearly three times year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has enormous potential for generating money, largely due to its mobile applications,” said Bloomberg analyst from Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July was 188 million, significantly above the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter came from mobile devices.
Alibaba is going to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The company’s road-show, which precedes this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
Until now, the record for the amount of funds raised on the U.S. stock exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the retail chains should be Russian-made, state Duma deputies believe.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of products of domestic production in stores should be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% on the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, reports the newspaper "Izvestia".
On August 27, the lower house of parliament introduced a draft law on amendments to the FZ "About retail markets", which proposes to revive in Russia farm markets, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Charged with Corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by Calvia police and officials to the office of the prosecutor of Majorca on Friday.
Calvia’s police chief on the resort island of Majorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalously infamous center of unbridled drunkenness in Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained on corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion from the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Guardia Nacional of Spain on corruption charges and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners say protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British recreator blowjobing 24 men while running through bars.
The island’s authorities have since tried to stop the bullying in a sober state among Magaluf holidaymakers, minimizing the number of scandalously well-known alcoholic bar races.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular among young British vacationers, has also been the site of numerous alcoholic intoxication accidents associated with insane fun known as "balcony" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING has prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell overnight on Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short rains with a gusty wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early portion of spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
The squalid conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but fell into a windshift zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction over a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to rise to altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two rains.
Calculation of the estimate of construction objects in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antitrust Service takes special control of the issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connection to the networks.
The FAS has established an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, Vadim Solovyev, head of the control department of residential, construction and natural resources of FAS, said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction objects is absolutely incomprehensible".
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, the FAS believes.
And offer the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of today’s estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are currently being considered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"The replacement of traditional estimate documentation in construction with calculations of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyev explained.
After all, now in the waste every bolt and nut is calculated, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation dishonest construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
I agree with the FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of value on constructive elements already exist: methods for calculating prices on constructive solutions, compiling estimates on these indicators have been developed," said Elena Zhukova, Head of the Department of Urban Development and Architecture of the Ministry of Architecture.
The field of road construction was selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the construction company "Profi-Invest" Anatoly Demyanko, the estimated regulations are obsolete for a long time, but another mechanism for business has not yet been proposed.
"As for the proposed calculations on the constructive elements, in practice, this is difficult to implement, since when building buildings are often used completely different technologies," - he believes.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of NP "Expert Community of Professionals of the State Order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director of engineering of the industrial center of capital construction Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that own monopolistic competencies and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from the influence of someone else.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state orders in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
In the mindset, it is believed that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to appoint the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of staff of the customer and budgetary expenses for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the works performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, in such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to a lack of interest in receiving a public order for incomplete work and a small amount of contract.
Deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Yevstaschenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has turned into a business game at the attention of the contractor.
And gave an example: "the participant when filling in the application must indicate "concrete indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "of the same type", "not below", "below", "below", "can't", "can't", "can't", "more", "can't", "can't", "more", "can'"
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting entities.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Yevstaschenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work at the stage of application through the "paper" offer of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, it is realistic to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even begun to be carried out, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is received.
The expert council was also proposed to move the margin income from the top to the bottom to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the State Secretary, Deputy Head of FAS Andrey Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will turn out, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and landmines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed.
The beginning of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the rocket-stricken settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed the traces of fragments from the walls and children's mountains before the arrival of the students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re happy to look to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly starting school again was “a bit strange.”
“It was a difficult time, and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not go out or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas further away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a piece of Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at the time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was severely hit by Palestinian fire.
He advised children to study diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you the knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
The Israeli side killed 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gazan militants fired 4,591 missiles and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people found shelter in more than 100 schools, which were converted into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and the fighting continued, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a combined increase of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the growth in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen by 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which underwent government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales, and current conditions with low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in Ufa's Oldest House
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Greater Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the eighteenth century has hardly changed since its construction, except for its old age.
Foreign people come here as a tour, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Uffizi house, the walls of which are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is not less than 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, whistling staircase.
The doors in the apartments are located close to each other, the walls have cracked, and in the lights from the plaster in places you can see the street.
I think it all comes down to an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's what it is."
Living in an 18th century wooden house is very difficult, - says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in state custody, but the money for its content is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly held, but the foundation has all rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can we be happy in such conditions?
The road runs directly under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian area.
Tatiana moves the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: there is a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the glasses are squeezing constantly, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
A man is accustomed to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
In addition, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
And in other families, the conditions are much worse, on the second floor ceilings are a little more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit her neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostinona.
A nice hospitable woman from the door offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: my husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another place to live - Lyudmila surrounds the room with her eyes: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them there is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrowly and little differs from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But from the ceiling it regularly flows: the plumbing system is nowhere to be found.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment ordinary and surprisingly at the same time, as an Italian woman whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it sums up in one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was completed about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former chulan.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, on the second floor there were servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
The UFO Real Estate Center says privatization doesn’t matter.
We will still get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim for more.
Four months ago, we were promised to relocate, but the promises did not go further.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with grandfather, mom with dad, I with husband and my daughter with granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, heavy rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flag, they are a meter thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on the eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
Maybe that's why he didn't kill anyone before the ceiling fell or his own.
Only the building still slowly dies before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
They say, and there is - under our room a secret lake and a walk to the river Bela, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that it was possible to hide from danger, in case of which.
They were chased.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them, begged to let him start in the apartment of the excavation.
And then convinced them to give them a living space in exchange for their one-bedroom apartment on October Avenue.
Lyudmila the historian refused:
Where are we four at a time?
And there is at least a small hope that will give housing more spacious.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the old-fashioned family didn’t win anything.
Lyudmila’s biggest dream was to move them, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations now live.
A cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see the conditions.
The plaster falls into pieces, like window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the faucet is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can be sure that the most lucky spouses Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the ground floor.
You are right, there are plenty of places!
The room is 75 square meters, three people are prescribed.
We live in exactly those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks on the seams, collapses, collapses.
Neighbors have already told you!
The most tortures we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally slipped under our feet.
I put the supports, the wedges; there is nothing in the room yet, and in the other room we walk, as if swinging on the swings, everything is so shaky.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The gold miner is treated as a native, he speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was unusual: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, cast guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of commercial real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century," says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard cabins, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something stopped them.
The story was repeated in 2014: they were again seduced by new housing.
We, as a team, gathered all the documents, bypassed the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
There's something we don't believe in anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The tenants did not accept.
They were sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a paper without a signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the tenants."
I even had the feeling that our house has not been in the city plan for a long time, because at first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was taken down in the '70s.
“Russian Planet” turned to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the Ufa Land Resources Management, Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of settlement of old housing.
I cannot be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, only I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully executed.
Residents will soon be relocated to new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
An architectural Biennale is now taking place in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Homes will acquire a proper appearance, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic on the roads in the city.
To displace people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorye due to a storm
Dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of Hunting site forestry in the Pozarsky district of Primorsky Krai.
At the scene of the fire, a grouping of forces and funds is being built up.
According to the leadership of KGSBU "Primorskaya Aviabasa", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the airbase:
The fire, which occurred in an inaccessible area, was detected by an observer pilot from a patrol aircraft An-2 on an area of 3 hectares.
Wooden remains are burned on the old burner.
The strong congestion of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable for landing paratroopers and fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the forces available to the airbase by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four fire paratroopers were quickly deployed to the extinguishing site.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishers.
In the lunch area in the area of the village Hunting helicopter additionally delivered 3 paratroopers firefighters.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the site of extinguishing, reports on the website of the administration of the Primorsky Krai.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, "Rare Records of Rudy", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often thinks about his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown-ups when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a kick in a cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions had become better than in his father’s day, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
It's a little better there now, but it's dark, smoky, the depths of hell's labyrinths with flashes of fire and smoke and piles of mud.
My dad went into the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash off the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry emerged from childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frances, allowed him to share the love he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frances.
Why don't I make friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, whom he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I make friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the people who killed her.
So when I really, really got better and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
That’s when I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectory is reflected perhaps in his noble, short-haired beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in the theater.
It was followed by "The Comedy of Mistakes" and then August Wilson's "The Fences".
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time, I was the only black parody/comic on television."
He was studying at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the "Black and White Menstrual Show", a lightweight entertainment program in which people "colored their faces", Henry discovered that he was performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I don’t want that to ever happen to me, but I don’t regret it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked on large pitches and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people."
Representing characters who both harassed the culture of black people in the UK and sang it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!".
The commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling time or quietly."
Next was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
You can't say that I was taught this in school, and I thought it was largely the prerogative of middle-class white people with pantyhose and cabbage down the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologue for a documentary, and he was caught.
I had a feeling that I could do it.
It was like my head was straightened.
"This is what it is, this is a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for the disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
“The voice inside of me said, ‘You’ll have to work 10 minutes while they’re doing the computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the issue was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "The Locks" at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Zorov".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above showing, "This is what you have to do."
He said it with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thinking of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he starts, then ends parody.
I just decided not to work on the stand because this thing with instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you're constantly striving for it, it can lead to a stalemate.
I sometimes work on Apollo Live whenever I want, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to get.
I'm wondering if he'll ever do a stand-up tour again.
“The joy of sitting in the room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the road – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's a nice party.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya began biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month goes missing due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to go to bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the government, reports BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All government officials must come to the identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do so without a respectful reason will be deleted from the statement of payment.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the bill of payment at both levels of the government - therefore, will put an end to the problem of "invisible workers", said Anne Vaiguru, secretary of state.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested in connection with a "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiring against the government,” local news agencies said.
Police officials did not immediately comment on the information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of setting up an organized crime group and wiretapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) identified their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told awaiting journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksandr Pastukhov, director of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke in Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the impressive executive she needs.
It is followed by a slew of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
She began her career at Bain and Co, a global management consulting firm, and then continued her career at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years after she resigned when a senior position at Pearson’s head company was taken over by a male colleague in a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political standing is also strong.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is an ex-counselor to Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the president a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as the voice of public unrest and agitation when something goes wrong.
This is an almost inaccessible duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, what kind of new president would risk coming, dismantling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself loses his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn’t be that difficult, many people will be happy to see how the BBC will shrink in size – after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiation of the cost of the license poses a special danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in the undoubtedly largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of her work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
What’s more, it’s obvious that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry of Texas says humiliating tweet was written by someone else
A tweet from a confirmed account of Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an insulting image of a Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by another from Perry’s account, in which the post was disavowed.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
“I don’t approve of this tweet, and I removed it,” the post said.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to the messages with a request to comment.
Although the records were uploaded from Perry’s confirmed account, it was unclear who was actually posting to this tape.
The earlier tweet contained a rude cartoon of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
“I don’t always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
They were handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the allegations a political hoax.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge conducting the case to dismiss the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor who has been in office for the longest time in Texas’ history is blurred, which is contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in the public sector of Texas, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto sparked an official complaint from a public control group with left-wing views.
The tape of Perry’s confirmed account is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at a party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he could get out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake, and the words: "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to a "normal state"
One of London’s best-known developers has warned that the real estate market in south-east England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Houses in the capital have been the subject of lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,” adding that this provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market was successful during the downturn as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in just the past year, according to the Land Inventory, significantly surpassing the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable and student schemes rose by about one-fifth last year to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped introducing new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the May general election.
The London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter lending conditions, would also result in a downturn in market growth in both real estate buy-and-sell transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast of rising prices for London real estate for 2015 to 3 percent on the basis that the mood for real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital proved very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added: “Demand for the right product with a good design and better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the time being remained.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April – almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual earnings before taxes rose by 40 percent from the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, and income by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking ahead of the company’s annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pidgeley said Berkeley’s expected revenue for this year would meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a profit of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million is expected for the whole year before taxes are paid.
The Berkeley stock price was held at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th American Film Academy’s annual awards ceremony.
The photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a “catalogue” of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesman for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "suddenly invading private space."
There has been an appeal to law enforcement, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to a lack of Apple’s online storage system iCloud, and the alleged “catalogue” of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of women celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Buinze, and Mary Elizabeth.
It is unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" Winsted on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"Those who look at the photos we took with our husband a few years ago, when we left home, I hope you are proud of yourself," Winsted wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victory Victoria" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These are the so-called photos of me naked FALSHIVKI, folks.
Let me stop this in the embryo. *Calambur intentional*
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos on which she is alleged to be authentic.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter “J” that has garnered critical acclaim
They dissolved, best to say, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed-minded, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was like a squirrel, yes.
The last victim of this stalk was a little romance from which he expected more than usual, ridding himself of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eilynn Solomons was a tremblingly brittle beauty with a freaky hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Robben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a raw but paradise-like valley under the joyous name of "Paradise Valley."
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, spiders sat still in the bathtubs, the mucus left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was covered with weeds, similar to giant nodules of cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both scary and enchanting, with a full-blown garden.
View of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the long list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eileen sat behind him, holding hands, in broken sunbeds among the tall grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both distractedly connected to the cheap console, which supplied the country with calming music and calming news.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on consoles.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren’t lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word "archaic" itself.
Public taste did things that could never be achieved by orders and precepts, and just as among books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, they chose ballads from all music.
Intrigued by this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and to sing the big legs of Eilynn with a rough comic voice.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically sticking two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it landed from his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew what was expected of him, that’s all.
He had to explain to me what jazz is.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz was not played either, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with sharpness.
Its unpredictability has affected people's nerves.
And jazz was an ingenuity expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Cavern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with the principle of group predisposition, thanks to those who were saved by fate.
People of African-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited to the sphere of entertainment and sports — and they sang and ran.
The natives of Indochina, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took care not to leave any family without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was a plate.
The natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not start to leave the country quickly, when what happened, if it happened in general, happened to them, in fear that they would be accused of igniting the flame, in fear, in fact, that the flame of the fire.
Everyone in their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for people who have big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him the illusion of safety.
Not a word could penetrate through the sound insulation of giant leaves, similar to cabbage.
Eilynn still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to press two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought him strange.
“He thought it was funny,” he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, closing Queverna's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but the tail of her blonde-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you're eating it for me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty that bleeds in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eilynn Solomons reddened and got up from the deckchair, rolling over the console and pouring out the wine they were drinking.
Wine from the oyster, so drunkenness could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to shake like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you because you have a dumb head," she said.
Even if you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about living in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main she was similar to the one here.
The same huge ice ocean crashed on both of them.
The same perplexed men, even more sensitive and capricious after what had happened, if it had happened in general, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand to pub.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a dumb fist if she wasn't careful!
They would have kissed first - the kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console issued - first to kiss her and then to hit her.
Too much clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eilynn Solomons showed the corps that he had to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt the weight of the lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, her companion is a man who has fallen on himself.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a touch of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hand at her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, shy, battered, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember any case, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or about that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the "Ofnau", the unofficial service of control of the public mood, prepared a small report on the preservation of the low and medium level of violence in the most frequent countries.
"A lot has been done, and a lot is done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of the people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these blurred branches and narrow settlements of the area, where, despite the ramblings of the walls of the church, the graceful spikes floated over the walls, not the churches.
However, some qualities are inexhaustible.
The higher the spindle, the lower the passions it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories about overcome obstacles and declares its fierce faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only old rudeness keeps its strong grip on the villages, villages and towns.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” her scientific director said after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, such as those you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church, and what you call “evil” and “cruel” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energeticity.
To continue to offer about what has happened, if it has happened in general, as if it had happened, if it ever happened, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head pink, like a flamingo, the LED letters repeated the advice that the Ofnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your husband, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you mean,” Esme Nussbaum quietly replied when she was sure that her scientific supervisor had finished saying, “and I don’t want to say anything but that we haven’t been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I’m concerned that if we’re not ready, we’ll find that we’re repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened if it happened in general.
Only this time will we cast our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the tip of his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, calling “mistakes” actions that our grandparents did or didn’t do.
You go too far and when you say that they have thrown their “anger” and “ mistrust” at “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, defending the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There were no “us” and there were no “others.”
It was a time of turmoil, that’s all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," she dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it’s good or bad, what’s done is done.
That's when it was.
There is nothing else to say, we agree.
And as you should not blame anyone, you should not even excuse yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not in order to learn -
The past exists in order for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
The Pyramid of Luther Rabinovich collapsed.
"I'll look at your report," he said, releasing it.
The next day, on the way to work, she was beaten by a motorcyclist, who drove on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in an angry rage".
The coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army Says Coup Was Not Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the coup was planned to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against the police, which they suspected was an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying that the country’s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, saying he had received a threat of assassination.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat from the "political fanatics" the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that really plan to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were willing to wreak havoc,” he told the Voice of America.
A South African government spokesman, Clayson Monella, said the army’s actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed power by force, according to all reports, the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho at the moment have the main signs of a coup," he said.
Representatives of the army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital is calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Moethjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabanan.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite allegations to the contrary.
"Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on the lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he was on the field with the London club only three times.
We will remind that before "Milan" rented from "Liverpool" attacking Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Eurozone’s manufacturing sector’s Business Activity Index (PMI) fell to a mark of 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and enterprises suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will wait from the bank for a clear plan on how to cope with stopping the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of inflation deflation, which is only 0.3%.
There is a suggestion that ECB President Mario Draghi could give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the dampening effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s senior economist.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in France’s second-largest economy, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the momentum of growth has gone out in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add to the confidence," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to fuel analysts awaiting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the euro area manufacturing sector’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially related to Russia / Ukraine – adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business — and especially consumer confidence — and is likely leading to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it “is increasingly like” that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some sort of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Residents of Mariupol will put out a live chain against the militias
Until last week, everything was calm in Mariupol - no one was rushing to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the "milicians".
According to the version of political scientists, the separatists break into Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which before that was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolers decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but it has a little strength against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build barracks and fortifications.
In the evening of Saturday several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the hymn of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten Years of Hell for the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the horrific seizure of the school, as the children who found themselves in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in the south of Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated on death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroically survivors of the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed something of the extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy brought East and West together in disgust, which surprisingly then turned into action and hope for a future in the midst of severe suffering.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who cheated on death during school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, although memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hopes?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine, in which children like them are being killed, will now end.
The girl in the photo trying to get back into the shooting sports hall
It is taken in a photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear tried to get back into the fired sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In her confusion, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now in her 40s.
There were fears that both of them died, but they actually survived.
“The woman told me to run, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There are a few bits left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just like doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoyeva, was murdered there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the catch remains with her, though her memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the internet where I step into a school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
A boy who ran through a bullet hole believing his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at the age of 7) and survived three days of seizure, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "My mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her by the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother has died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went free and was in the hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I was crying with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now non-existent News of the World) where he was awarded as the Children's Advocate by Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
I can tell you that he is fading in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the yard with who never got out.
We never say they are dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose anything I wanted, and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of misery that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered last week at a women’s monastery.
I want so much to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope to be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, you can imagine?
I remember the terrifying silence immediately after the capture, just there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I’d like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I still think this world hasn’t gotten any better in 10 years.
There is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like us.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not angry.
He does not seek revenge, for example, he is not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember him, but they’re very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he was suffering from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is 17, he's above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get up on my feet, I looked around, I saw the hell around me when parts of the bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember shouting at him, ‘Damir, run, run’, but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: surviving Beslan George Ilin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and right George today
His bloody face had a scare of fear as he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of a nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
It was only George who survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
Falling into the soul: the photograph of Georgi (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanted so much to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of George crying in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in a bookcase in our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photograph makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now: “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens because if you ask people, no one wants war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget her a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had nightmares because of the capture, but now it got better.
I went back to school in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget that, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and enrolled at the Medical University in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardio surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won’t happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of the killer terrorist
Unbelievable: Georgi Farniev was at the feet of the killer terrorist during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an FSB intelligence officer but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I’m older now, and they say that kids can easily cope with bad events – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I ever entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with an open on a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they’ve never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical records, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals, from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know, and certainly not what they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to commemorate her.
I know George won't go.
For him, she has to be even stronger, because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help it.
I'm so thankful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the print is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do them because of his knees.
He has had several operations, he can walk, but he can’t do sports.
I’d say he’s overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it’s impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and that only aggravates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away as far as you can.
Alyona Zkayeva, 10 years old
The baby touchingly taken to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alyenu Zkaev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian policeman took Alyona out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but with cruelty left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the gym of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alena's mother and sister were killed in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, say neighbors.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both wonderful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, said he is looking forward to getting back on the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I’m very happy to play for Borussia again,” Kagawa said.
I feel very good.
It is full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to come out on the field again in the form of "Borussia".
We will remind, Kagava moved to "MU" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to establish himself as a member of the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, scoring 6 balls and giving 8 assists.
A man accused of hitting a girl on a pedestrian "pelican" in Fife
A 78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing "pelican" in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly beat a girl at a crossroads in Pittenvine, East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due caution and attention and beat the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not open in Vladivostok
The duty-free store Duty Free at Vladivostok Airport has posted a sign banning purchases at this store from a number of world political leaders.
Don't let them get away with perfumes, vodka and cognac.
The store administration has decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known comrades will not be able to get vodka, cognac and perfumes in their store.
And she hung a corresponding plaque on the door.
Earlier, Obama was banned from appearing in an even less accessible kind of institution - Dietary dining rooms MSU, as reported by the website of the institutions.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet restaurant in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly seem terribly clever to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to set up the production of cheeses demanded by buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the enterprise "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to reorient themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes performed at their own level, - quotes "All sport" words Maslakov.
Third place is the confirmation of our high level of command.
It is good that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It is important to note that we did not prepare for this competition.
The season is over, and we didn’t commit our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the team.
The French, on the contrary, exhibited a combat-capable team, including 13 European champions.
They did not conceal their intention to win this year, which was repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were much lower than in the same "Diamond League".
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important to the result, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, there was an absurdity, when at 1500 m men were so fascinated with tactical tricks of running that they showed a result below the average level... of women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve the best quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or shoot a video underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof washer, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a few cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules you need to follow in order to get the best results.
Inspect your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be shooting.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer’s guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them won't work.
The washers have LCDs that will help you compose photos, while the action cameras usually don’t have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
Make a few frames.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that shoots multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, take advantage of it.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, river, or ocean.
This will also allow you to pass on more colors in the photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you will see.
Navigate closer to the shooting objects.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater due to darkened light conditions.
Especially important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This instrumentation is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to get close to the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze winner of the 2012 Olympic Games for free wrestling Billyal Mahov can move into the Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of the Dagestan national team for free struggle Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Mahov is on the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sajid Sajidov.
In general, in juniors Bilyal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the Volunteer Tournament and the third prize winner in the Greek-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free struggle.
For a long time there have been talks that the new stage of our career will be our heavyweight in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Mahov can play already at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the pretense.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose personality might shake everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
Consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to rid patients of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are passionate about diagnosis and disease, those undergoing treatment mostly worry about something completely different – pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel as normal,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find my strength.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he finds himself annoyed by his wife, Juliet.
“I want it to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
There was something wrong.
He asked his colleague to get a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
X-rays have arrived.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lung lining.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But with the mesothelioma in a different way.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle,” but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was in use, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dockworkers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But such tranquility is wrong.
The UK is currently at the height of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people are dying from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and estimated number of future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the specialties of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
Bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The building is filled with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are meant to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he realized.
"It looks like there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Gaia Hospital where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who have been interns at Gaia Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he said in a 2010 letter, “I was the only one left alive.”
How many of us will get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pitot, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they will die that way.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had inadvertently exposed Janice Ellen to asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew of asbestos.
I couldn’t think that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestosform", which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocodile).
The UK was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, albeit indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by environmental asbestos exposure.”
Much of this impact, he says, is due to “the usual use and impact of weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the heart of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be driven by something as harmless as "strong airflows".
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Directorate for the Maintenance of the Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace did not receive a "clean sanitary certificate", it now recognized that it was necessary to carry out works of <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion on the reconstruction of the parliament, improving the electricity and removing the asbestos, and that after the election of the universal center.
Goddard’s report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules.”
It is impossible to know if this error of management will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked at a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related lawsuits,” he says, “but I can’t prove that in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that was like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I started having a fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt awful.
I didn't think I'd be able to drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn’t go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the chest and put on pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for testing.
Yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was exercising and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in the reception room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma".
However, even then, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
Eventually, his patient was dozens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consulting physician showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about that, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year: “I was told it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott plunged into a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom offered him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings where there was quite often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did), were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its amazing insulation and fire resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.
Throughout the country, on countless chemistry lessons, students installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
There are websites that draw attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or shed roofs usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful, mowing the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes a lot of time to realize this,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
As the countless number of patients before him, he remembers how bewildered he was with the amount of information that had to be taken.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have?'
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life - the act of breathing itself - that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lung shell.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from the inhalation of asbestos needle fibers,” Professor Tom Tressier, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to the hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The Treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed to him while in the hospital.
When asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are exhaled to the periphery where the shell is.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot controversy.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The Treasurer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the pleura," he says.
It is impossible to walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very well suited to chemotherapy", which "acts" but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are patients who live long,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after being diagnosed, turned himself into a support and counseling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he cheerfully said when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and he is still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life by just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "tried to give everything a slightly more positive color."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Lo<0xC3><0xAF>k Lang-Lazdunsky, a professor of chest surgery at the Gaia Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need a direction, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham said.
The average patient would have to get direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best out of existing treatments.
However, when such treatment is finally inevitably ineffective, many patients face yet another financial cause for concern - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they turn to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That’s when we talked about the company’s dishonesty.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement," Morgan said, as Lawson couldn't unambiguously prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking deadly asbestos contact to one company or workplace — usually decades later — has been a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that they have time on their side, which the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
In response, serious new legislation has come out this year, which facilitates the process of recovering compensation for patients with mesothelioma, even if their former employers can not be traced.
Under the law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350-million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary case of compensation - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if there had been no interval and patients with mesothelioma could track companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labor and Pensions, has admitted that the law is “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, quick action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and they need help today,” Penning said during a second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Lang-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations Lang-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Tressier, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunsky can boast as many as 40 percent of the surviving patients over five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see that in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things — about finances when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for a parent,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease, which meant that I would not live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all the cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma does not pose a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissues.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen the pans and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented that does not ignite.
I've seen napkins made from it rotting in the fireplaces at banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were, beyond doubt, the main cause of death.”

Compensation is not paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding developed intensively, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health damage claim caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
The world production of asbestos grows to more than 4213000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tons.
The UK’s Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the UK.
A <0xC2><0xA3>350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters vow revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to kick off long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the statement.
The decision of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives, in essence, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“This has not defrauded our expectations, but it still drives us into rage,” said Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau.
That’s not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People’s Representatives, said allowing a popular nomination for Hong Kong’s head of state would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when Britain handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to vote to elect a head of government starting in 2017.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands through a nomination committee tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years took place.
Much of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaign is backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district unless Beijing guarantees true universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving into a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is with great regret that we announce that all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong’s state authorities were preparing for Beijing’s statement for several days, and on Sunday security measures were stepped up at the government headquarters with police and barricades involved.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of inhabitants from the mainland increases competition in the sphere of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are putting business, a source of Hong Kong’s vitality, at risk.
“The protest they are talking about could lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a bad idea for investment.
Chinese state-run media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong’s democratic activists have been portrayed as saboteurs led by Western powers.
This summer, the activists organized an informal referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
American culture of graduation scores reaches university life: first-year students are offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are delighted to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of the arrival at the university, the company also offers such transport options as a personal jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to the university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the service has just been launched, orders have not yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that despite the fact that students face the need to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year for training, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today’s students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Student Union has criticized this service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS’s senior vice president of higher education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who begin their studies at the university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly rising costs of basic necessities before they can even begin to think about what to put in a thousand pounds.
Feminists raise the issue of racial affiliation and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who arrive raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw responses from white women, who focused 100 percent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with such headlines as "Thoughts about Ferguson from the Face of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so linked to racial affiliation, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson uncovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how black people are attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to talk in public about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality issues in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a challenging reality every day.
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the rape of a white woman was almost always the basis for this," said Hattery.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynchage.
From Hatter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one of the groups: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and voting rights for blacks should come later,” said Hattery.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why black women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women’s Association to prevent lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “get over” the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
“Truly, would it be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?” she asked.
Feminists of the second wave, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by the Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in the anti-racism protests.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers inherent in the body – and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls – will be at the forefront of change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is arguing for more cross-cutting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
Researcher at the American Institute of Entrepreneurship Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young men, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she made.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program called “My Brother’s Watch” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem advancing the frontline of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the nation’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the issue as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of worker visas are issued to [immigrant males], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are getting a response from women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with pigs" for sale
The photograph of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, a separate one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - on which was depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was mistakenly posted and has already been removed," the company's spokesperson said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom detached house".
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still retained in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the game of the fourth round of the US Open, Caroline Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to dignify the year and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily Osipov from New York.
How will you overall rate your results at the Big Helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad we managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even reach the quarterfinals.
What are your goals until the end of the season?
After an offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to take it to a new level.
I have a lot of work to do, and I’m going to do everything I can to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolay Valuev proposed to give bonuses when enrolling in universities for compliance with GTO standards.
According to him, in general, the norms will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the norms on lifting, running and other exercises.
Recall, 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement GTO norms on their territory from September 1.
I also offered to the schoolchildren who gave up the GTO, to give bonuses when enrolling in universities, - said Valuyev.
For example, you can add some points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to give additional leave to workers of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales a new millionaire appeared after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday night.
The Harvey Newspaper Kiosk brings gold to the main draw for the second time in five years, the past win amounted to $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to declare himself.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the win of the main prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires, following the couple’s huge $7.5-million win from Belmont just weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and has reported that the win has given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire brings the number of top prize winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drafted by the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - beginning of October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concerning electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available from Vedomosti) is for 2014-2017.
The criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government, which will describe tax and customs support measures for electric vehicles, will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of cars, stimulating localization and creating service infrastructure will be developed.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to the regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (on parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators of evaluation of the activities of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still being formed – in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts Mitsubishi Motors CEO in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold increase does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
Only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says the director of strategic planning and partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport have taken a waiting position in relation to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is miserable.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to "ASM-holding", "AvtoVAZ" produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of "AvtoVAZ" on engineering Sergey Amanov, without the state support of the breakthrough in this segment will not be.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the cost of cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (tanks - units), exhales the CEO of "Avtostarkov"
Due to the cost and low rates of cost reduction, electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, forecasts the editor-in-chief of "Avtorev" Mikhail Podorozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, on the other hand, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to give confidence to consumers that "e-mobility" is real; this, in particular, will be facilitated by the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Slimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rossetti": in Moscow, several stations have been built, soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of the gas station network are also underway with other regions.
According to the director of the department "Rossettey" Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the market of electric vehicles and is ready to build filling stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a uniform standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company, does not have the right to sell electricity, the possibility of doing so with regard to charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the Russian electric car market is zeroing customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, extension of the preferential list is under consideration.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, according to Pankov.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, stimulating measures for car owners are also needed, for example, free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on designated lanes, which in Russia is not yet.
A private jet crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it have died, Itar-Tass reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The crash took place a few kilometers from the runway of the Denver City Airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, prisoners of the battalion "Donbass" are dealt with.
The prisoners were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine is, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Carats from the battalion "Donbass" remained alive after that "meat grinder" in which they fell under Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the "ring" can be exited by the supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes later, shells and bullets flashed on all sides.
"Judging by the information that I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the deputy commander of the battalion, who has a surname "Lermontov".
And when we descended into the lowlands between Mnogopol and Chervonoselsky, a crossfire began with anti-tank guided missiles, with 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and there were only two cars left.
The officer with the nickname "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died afterwards.
Survivors are now being treated by those they came to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicine.
At the same time, their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to true death.
They simply betrayed us, they say.
The Column, the whole battalion to destroy it.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Already here Alex saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that a mortar shelling was going on, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written the report about leaving.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from the collections with Zurahovo.
According to the prisoners, a man 300-350 was trapped in the "boiler" under Ilovaisky.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would not have joined the punitive battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, a headquarters for limiting the prices of products
In the Krasnoyarsk region, a headquarters has been established, which, if necessary, will limit the increase in prices for products in the region’s market.
The decree for the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the local government, representatives of the executive and supervisory authorities.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
News Economy <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Will Kiev "Rosneft" compensate for $140 million losses?
Rosneft chief Igor Sechin said the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisychansk gas station in Ukraine at $140 million.
This was reported in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage to $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation,” Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisychansky LNG plant was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no fighting, there were no ‘insurgents’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared,” he said.
Recall, on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisychansk tank burned a tank for storage of oil and destroyed the buildings of the two warehouses.
Lisychansky LPP is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisychansk LNG plant is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as diesel batches of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisychansk LNG was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisychansk NPP together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, it happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
According to the Interfax Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.

The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued to decline rapidly, but this time there was no panic.
The ruble continued cheaper and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already replaying the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, this is more like artificial hysteria inflated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency can be adjusted.

Twitter tries to be more interesting for new users
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the user registration process to engage new members more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogging.
Now, new Twitter users will browse a large number of the service’s recommended accounts while signing up to instantly make up their reading circle.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated when registering.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a subscription tick for all automatically selected accounts.
Due to this, the user will have to remove the check marks manually, so as not to read those who are not interested in them.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only the avatars of recommended users, now Twitter is taking a sample of one of the blogger’s popular tweets to help make an impression on a person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter’s registration page in three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on upgrading the service.
Such activity is primarily associated with the continued efforts of the service to achieve losslessness.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in reader activity.
The company is desperately in need of more loyal consumers who, once there, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising resources.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be rainy and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, according to meteorologists.

Vehicle Recycling Program Renewed on September 1st
From September 1 in Russia, the program for the recycling of cars is renewed.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Commerce of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other directions of support.
The program will affect all cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a car to 350,000 rubles for a truck.
Earlier in Russia, a similar program of recycling of cars was already in place.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only the use of machines to get a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of six years, to buy a new one with a discount when the old one is handed over to the dealer, reports Interfax.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million pieces (that is, plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nicky Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is only now widely known.
The inspiration for the game came from events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a title, will be how the information coverage of the stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population take place.
The hero can differently photograph what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the policemen will look like heroes and the protesters like gangsters, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary person cannot go.
If he will shed light on the events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale rebellion.
The points in the game will need to be scored with the help of the hero's twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of its release and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, has published an image showing how an event can change depending on how the photo is taken and processed about it.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the US, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to shed light on the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what had happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from Case's biography, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his homophobic parents about his relationship.

With the call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Valery Geletey, draws the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Moscow, of course, paid attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who said about “the completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great domestic war”, in which the losses will be calculated “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page the aforementioned post, is the subject of research by specialists in the non-military field," the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the defense minister of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels, the Russian side has repeatedly threatened that in the event of continued resistance, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that the "operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine" has been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate photos of the stars and apologized
Today, the horror has reached more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data store) on smartphones, after which their intimate photos appeared on blogger Perez Hilton’s website.
Really, not for long.

Tony Stewart is in an accident when he returns to the track.
Tony Stewart’s return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre broke in 172 rounds, ending his performance.
Stewart brought his smashed car to the garage and then left without talking to reporters.
Team leader Chad Johnston said 14 team members are upset, but will now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll get there better.
Stewart first hit the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after colliding with Kyle Bush, requiring repairs on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty big hope of getting to the finish line," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was sunk into an evacuator, and the crew gathered and were ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver while racing on a dirt track in northern New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to take part in the Persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went to the track to express his displeasure to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement agencies said on Friday that the trial of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
A decision on whether Stewart will be indicted has not been made.
The three-time champion was met with loud shouts and applause when he was represented before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stewart went into the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then 122 rounds after Bush restarts.
Car 18 dropped off the trajectory at the exit of Turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but lagged behind to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Zhvanetski in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not miss to report on her Instagram.
However, one photo was very surprising and very confusing to the fans of the couple.
The photo was taken from Zhvanetskoy.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhailych Zhvanetskoy Maxim explains what is an instagram:)) #odessa", - signed a photo of Ksenia Sobchak.
There are no cigarettes on the table.
No coffee, buns, butter or anything.

Prison officials of Bulgaria held a national protest action
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital of the country Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore former working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements, which will be discussed with acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison workers has met repeatedly with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are continuing, said the head of the Main Department for the execution of sentences, Rosen Jelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Unions of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior will join the protest of the union of prison employees.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayut (right) appointed Right Wongswan (left) as Defense Minister
The military ruler and prime minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-ocha, has announced the formation of a new cabinet of ministers in which more than a third of the posts are held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-ocha was formally approved as prime minister after the king of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old soldier, who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed deputies to parliament.
According to Prayuta Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by a six-year-long demonstration during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat’s government.
Prayut Chan-ocha will officially be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
It is a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also arrested.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when the army dismissed Brother Yinglyk Chinavat Taksin as prime minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern parts of the country, which has ensured their success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have joined an anti-government movement that has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one has ever said that the salad will be better, I didn't promise you that, jokes the waitress from the new bracelet Palm.
It must be formally admitted that it is indeed so, but the mind and the stomach remain inflexible.
After all, everyone knows for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean the media, we say "the media" - we mean "Belgium".
Restauranters like to say that the success of a restaurant depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that are not that good, and even great, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a café "Gorodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bojole" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg is located above the ground: a bar stand and a pair of tables, all the rest of the space is devoid even of hints of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - televisions, where the maids swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have not been a novelty for a long time, so compare with what to eat.
There are eight types of pouring beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and countless bottled (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, saying that "the media are satiating big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in terms of content, but often very unexpected in terms of execution.
Well, for example, it is possible to predict that a meat roulette with a Walloon currant (280 rubles) is in fact a carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper in comparison with it will appear to be awfully thick.
You can feel some taste only if you fold the half-boards together.
Salads are even worse.
Classical Liege (260) would be most right to recognize a crime against the Belgian people: some rotten iceberg, once cooked a long time ago potatoes, sautéed Kenyan beans, bacon chips, plus why some marinated.
With such a salad, you will not want to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes on immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or roasted champignons, then why do the mussels look like they have managed to defrost and boil several times in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea shells here!
They are served in pans "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, one made from white wine, celery and carrots, did not frankly set.
There are vegetables, and there is no aroma, and even if there was wine, it remained a mystery.
But good relying on mussels fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken vaterzaja here is not a crumb, thick to the point that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
It was stated that the rabbit is cooked by a local chef in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the ground, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary muted everything.
There was an impression that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during his life, why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time to the leg of the rabbit was attached a wonderful - no, just a fine pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also saturated - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be too watery, and the waffles were dried.
But the manager approached the table very informally inquired about lunch impressions.
So you should come back again.
The exchange rate of the dollar rose on the MMVB above 37 rubles on the news about the upcoming new sanctions against Russia by the West.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculated "tomorrow" at 10:29 pm grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it was 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says Anna Bodrov, senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected on the courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of the troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news yesterday was erased.
The week, according to the specialist, will close near these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links of a single chain.
Inflation spread is also forecast: to current prices for the autumn will add from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and there will be some vacuum as the networks redirect to other suppliers.
"The dollar reached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no strong hysteria," commented Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department of Opening Broker.
They will still be looking at whether they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then went news about Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it is completely switching to the floating rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful has happened.
The turbulent times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when at the end of January there was increased demand for the currency, as well as on the third of March when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
In UFS IC also see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in imports, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexey Kozlov.
The negative points can be attributed to the increase in imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, inhibits the development of the country’s economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths down the price of shares, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index declined by 1.67% during trading on Thursday, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decrease in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional in nature and is due to the massive desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually disappear, and the quotes of the ruble partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - says Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
The British woman said she spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharko-Mari-Tuta disease (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that lead to damage to nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK has reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with MTS because so little is known about this condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have an MTS, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and pressed toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich's ataxia, a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she would die before she was 30.
The mother of two, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others could.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I was never able to ride a roller or skateboard with other kids, and I was a lot bullied at school because of how I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical record when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where it shouldn't go, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a far lesser threat to your life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have an MTS.
“When he explained what the SMT was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK’s SMT charity has announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington area increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose moderately last year as the economy accelerated recovery, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia paid $27.6 billion to the state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business per state and local level rose by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when bills declined, in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes levied by the state grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by the professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56 percent, come from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenues come from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
The rise in tax revenues is largely driven by a return to companies’ previous real estate value levels, researchers say, raising real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row when growth was less than 1 percent.
While much of this revenue comes from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, it seems the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, up $9.6 billion from 2012—an increase of 4.2 percent over the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on tax revenue growth across the state and local levels in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies’ tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay real estate taxes,” Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Tax Center, said in a statement.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurial incomes also seem to be going up, according to these figures.
Companies in the region have declared a state-wide corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up $2.1 billion from 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although the trends are in one direction, the tax burden for entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the country average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues have risen below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia had lower taxes for business owners per state and local level and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for business owners than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed a bill lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its tax revenue targets next year, the law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneur taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure under which the majority of small firms are organized - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to more than $2.4 billion.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country are likely to continue this year, with revenues from turnover tax in state and local governments rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be lagging behind, as a reduction in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The World Judo Championships brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competition - the Japan national team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one comment received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men's competitions in the category of up to 66 kg, Mikhail Pulyaev received silver, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russians ceded the 2011 and 2013 world champion to the Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarter-finals, won the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also reached the third stage of the pedestal of honor Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current world champion Mylinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who in this championship played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzyutin won against Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way of the Russian woman to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category of up to 73 kg, put bronze in the pot of the Russian national team.
In the quarterfinals, the offender was former Moldovan representative Viktor Skovortsov, now representing the UAE team.
However, the Russian then won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who took UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze finished the performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg won Ivan Nyfontov.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt by a remark from the opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Askesov, and the Russian national team this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the consolation final was his compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Question was not able to get out on the tatami due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put into the cage of the team by Renat Saidov, who performed in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clear victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were not lucky - they did not reach the medal.
But the Russian judoists conquered the team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a stubborn fight with a score of 2-3 gave way to the main favourites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian national team led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and the will - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Cambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, gave the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competitions in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was visible that you could become champions," Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the natives of judo - there is nothing wrong here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian national team performed much better at the domestic world championships than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
Of course, we are all maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in this form of sport, such as judo", - summed up the results of the tournament the Minister of Sport of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The team of Japan was expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian actress will recover from the disease.
“Thank you for your constant love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call saying she had had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy".
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All the kings can.
The debut album of the band Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, took the rock duets out of the clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has only been on stage for a year, but has already been nominated for a BBC Music Award, an Arctic Monkeys warm-up tour and a visit to a New York gig by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before release, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is coming out of a number, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-haired representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duet of bullish-looking Britons playing with that level of volume and intensity.
In general, the stakes on the first album in connection with all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been quite justified.
It was not in vain that the duo took a name that they could have touched before, except that they were desperate hairy metallics, and the blood of what kings they thought flowed in their veins, is also understandable.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the stagnating blood of British rock, taking it to a new height.
Making predictions about the success of this enterprise is perhaps early, but something can already be asserted.
A dozen songs set in thirty with a few minutes is not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal composer's gift, but a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is easier to whistle at all than to drink.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing album composition "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather to be the successors of Motörhead), but have brought out numerous rock duets from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, obviously close to her.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of the bass, replacing the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in the instruments, but also in the approach to songwriting.
The heroes of the retro-rok zeros were hardly chosen beyond the post-modernist paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not only as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and abruptly that this strain successfully drapes some secondary and rigidity of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon to Buy Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store – and video producer, and a hundred other things – is buying a streaming video service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google video service for a good billion seemed completely ready, and such a combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set the goal to be a streaming service of a general nature - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And let's play, a genre of videos in which all-knowingly give (mainly old) games processing, like in "The Mysterious Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a rooted tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to the information, he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shire: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they’ll do better than watch sports, find it hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the joystick in their own hands.
One thing is to watch through a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another thing is to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of view on your own can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
“I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about the virtuosity of the game or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon make money on this?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch rolling into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to have: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not present signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the 2004 terrorist attack, more than 330 people were killed, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked with the surviving hostages - almost all students, with the parents of the dead, with the guardian of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the committee "Mother of Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation of the employee of the Ministry of Health, - says Anvshon Korresh.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President on the North Caucasus and was negotiating with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "B" FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during the work on this topic is that it was as if there had been no such ten years in Beslan.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very difficult.
But you can not forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job," Antonova said.
The special project is prepared by the infographic studio of the Rambler & Co. holding company, which has been working at the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s tenure in power.
North Korea launches a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, on the border between North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
MEPs proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, the data of the Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma has introduced a draft law that provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, in the opinion of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more expeditious and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and the observance of the secret of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which hastens parliamentarians to enter into force, obliges to store personal data of Russians processed via the Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes mandatory the recording, systematization, storage, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of Russian citizens, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of violators of websites - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugova and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
Djengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current draft law on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation, will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the draft law submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, said that he does not see any problems with the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storage of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "to Rostelecom", which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, to GroupMail.
"In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the Russian Federation, I see no problem – they will get technological opportunities for accommodation,” Levin said.
The Disputed Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill is passed, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for flights and hotels.
According to the association, "the draft law deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, determining imperatively that their registration, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is being carried out and to systematize his personal data.
In this case, you will be able to choose on which territory these actions will take place.
The adoption of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the loss of global services and significant economic losses.
Ice water bucket test participant evaded jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with a bucket of ice water went to pain wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so loudly during a test with a bucket of ice water that she shook her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.

Militias handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The "Army of Novorossia" claim that they shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the agreement on a ceasefire
As of 10:00 a.m. on September 1, the militias handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to "Interfax" a representative of the press service "Army of Novorossia".
He added that “the air defense forces in the area of the town of Mereshka shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreements”.
According to the agency’s interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions when artillery shelling Lugansk airport.
The spokesman noted that the militias overnight managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force on one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored vehicles and two warehouses with ammunition.
"The losses in the live force of the enemy - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people," - summed up the representative of the staff.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the "Army of Novorossia", "interrupted the attempt of the Nazi Guards in violation of previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area".
Then the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the staff, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) that night were five tanks, eight combat armored vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area of the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the encirclement.
In the DPR agreed to go on this condition that the enemy hand over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the encircled settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semenchenko, on Sunday night, another 14 people left the "boiler".
In his Facebook page, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity with the 137th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the Russian Federation and the 9th Tank Brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said the European Council's "conclusions" of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country," the ministry's website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing parties", the ministry stresses.
The ministry’s website also notes that there are currently no objective estimates of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of casualties among the civilian population is increasing.
During the next seven days in the European Union, it is planned to develop concrete proposals on sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives are working closely with U.S. officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the measures to be introduced with respect to the period of effect and the degree of severity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced the extension of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Clever ways to save money on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move on to the second course, has come up with a tricky way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation so that they postpone their sale.
“My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to the Schroeder system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often costs considerably less than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rentals has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented out, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Shopping in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book may be one-third of what you’ll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 per price, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying a used
If you’re not against someone else’s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in second-hand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Caseday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of the booklet Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business.
The book was sold for $48.
Lecturers such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the Wallless College at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, invite students to clarify with their professors whether they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are insignificant for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Renting
It is worth thinking about renting textbooks, if you are good enough to handle them, do not forget to return them and do not want to keep them for yourself after the course is finished.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for about $20 per semester.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any fines that may be imposed on you for markings, underscores, and damages.
If you are renting a book, remember: if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually leased by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
“Mathematical Analysis” on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most affordable prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
No matter what, take a look.
Joe Galt, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the prices for the book, as this ensures that you are looking for the right text for you.
Before ordering online, says Galt, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed by four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declares total inefficiency of Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budgetary investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reported.
“15 billion rubles remain on deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East and their criteria until 1 July.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing transport accessibility of the region, lifting infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create the preconditions for attracting additional investments in the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive with regard to key business centers of the ATP, the President stressed.
Recall, it was previously reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the OEZ.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save cash
Sylvester Stallone's Unstoppable 3 returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the U.S., while City of Sins: A Woman for Whom It's Worth Killing only returned $12 million from his $70 million budget.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz brought in only $14.6 million over the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to tame a dragon 2" also disappoint with revenue.
The Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a matter of poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year in history in terms of children's films, and called "How to tame a dragon 2" a barely "functioning" sequel to the fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of slightly older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer to at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be a matter of changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney film Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must acknowledge this and not try to chase after what was before.
Unlike the current drop in cash fees in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "crash."
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there was some truth in his dark predictions.
Due to the fact that several potential box office hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including "Avengers: Age of Altron", "Mignons" and "Jurassic Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in cash charges simply “cyclical,” saying the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
The food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general public prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to have a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” Italian restaurant chef Barlotti Mariano Valerio says of the quality of cheeses that Italian suppliers offer him in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a small shelf life.
Parmesan supplies should be enough for a couple more months.
What should I do?
Switching to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go yet.
The meat was lying on the trucks only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day, they brought me some fish from the Far East.
So she turned out to be brittle!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many customary things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to be suspended to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with local beef.
Then they asked me, “Where did you get such delicate meat?”
I said, this is yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchins.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Arrow" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, “Well, we have to make money, too.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their coat of arms weighs?
The price seems to be super delicacies.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "The first three months everything was good, then the quality fell sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don’t know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yoghurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a quarrel with suppliers: prices for products have increased, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
This will most strongly affect expensive restaurants with a monokitchen in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from "mother" countries.
The general survey had to be rebuilt before.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions in the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban Atlantic salmon and trout malts, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italy’s Valerio hopes the sanctions can be eased further.
So far, some restaurants exist in uncertainty.
According to the company “East-West”, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
We only have very few such chefs, and it can take two to three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to refuse from 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to rework.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, they are already starting to replace dishes, for example, steaks made of marble beef - with steaks, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, - lists the representative of the company "East-West" Oksana Glibchuk.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and sesame from Norway - salmon, sesame, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: there were hardly gourmets able to distinguish the Italian mozzarella from the Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace,” Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
Cafe owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones.
But there are also many restaurants that are not affected by the sanctions.
These include restaurants with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Way Mae!".
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, at the base of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use."
At Kolbai restaurants, not a single dish has been removed from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurant "Chaikon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions are also not embarrassing: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia sets up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in the price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS you can get cheaper cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish that way.
After the imposition of sanctions, Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Agriculture spokesman Olympiy Artikov said that he plans to double exports of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the "Money" request, also react fairly calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald’s Press Service said localization exceeded 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80% of the products the network purchases in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctional products" in general occupied no more than 4%.
They weren't affected by the sanctions and the Walker noodles.
KFC, Burger King and Chicken Potato have not responded to the Money request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy Chilean fish rather than Russian ones.
On his shoulder.
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that due to the increase in demand prices are rising even for local products.
“On products for Grabley, prices have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio – twice,” says restaurant director Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10%, admits Kolbaya.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased by 10-15% since the beginning of August".
“Brazilian suppliers have nearly doubled the price of pork,” said Sergei Rac, deputy CEO of Stardogs.
Chickens increased by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, there will be a planned price increase of 8% at Stardogs.
“It’s already very undesirable to raise prices,” says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth in general income for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it’s unclear how quickly: as long as most restaurateurs stock up on food for the next two months in hopes of anticipating a shift in purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
At the center of the stage, the musicians play the waltz.
It is a festival of regional products with the fun title "There is time to eat".
"We were going to make a local food festival for a long time, and here the sanctions, we rushed, organized the festival," - says one of the organizers.
Behind the scenes with musicians, Greek chef Anastass cooks salad from pasta and homemade candy, the other day there was a master class on preparing borsch with caramelized apples.
All from Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from the Moscow suburban "Sovhoza named after Lenin", cheese from the Italian dresser Jay Clouse.
“Salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the “My People” fish shop.
We've got a squid, a cat, a chickpea, an octopus, a chavych, a "royal salmon."
Yes, they are not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is also aquaculture.
If you hold him in your hand, he won't even move.
You can't hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only the establishments without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella domestic
In the showcase of his tent are shrimps with the label "Magadan", fever, omel, muksun, measles from Crimea, clams from the Far East.
Galkin is convinced that it is long time to go to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
The store "Your people" has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the introduction of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple things".
Now Galkin received applications from 15 other restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, he warms up.
We have tried different recipes, we have tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through the online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared a serving of "Philadelphia" with a cat.
Unlike rolls with semolina, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the store "Your people" there are even rolls of mantle and sea turtle.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon is preferable to Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“Russian fish suppliers have not offered us yet,” explains Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev.
The same situation with other products: Russian producers could occupy the liberated niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the project LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, now we can talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers of other countries will benefit from the ban in the first place," Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the operation of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg was temporarily suspended.
“We are investigating the substance of the claims to determine the actions necessary to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
In fact, no one really knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, - says on condition of anonymity the employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald’s is shutting down all over the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of reference GIBDD
Payments on the helmet will be possible without a GIBDD certificate - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft instructions, according to which from September 1 this year, to receive payments on the helmet, the insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate of GIBDD.
It is true that this is only the case when the accident was registered under the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached agreement on the question of who was responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400,000 rubles.
The point is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be registered under the "europrotocol", drivers who have been in an accident cause accidents.
After all, in the presence of a helmet policy, it was not possible to get a refund without a GIBDD certificate.
The parameters prescribed in the draft guidelines are designed to remove this obstacle on the way to the implementation of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment on the helmet in connection with the accident, made without employees of the GIBDD, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it can not be higher than the limit specified in the helmet insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS and road employees.
But, most likely, neither drivers nor insurers will be delighted by it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of growing fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules for helmet payments.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to file a minor accident because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
The savings certificate will be made nameless and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the presenter, but will allow banks to make them a counterpart of the irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates for the presenter.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates on the applicant do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, because you do not have to make a deduction to the fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (DCA).
The pungency of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and will be affected by it Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the ASV explains, is that the customers of a small bank, who have bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his licenses try to get money from the ASV.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on the depositor, may assume that their investments are insured.
A reasonable lack of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of filing certificates tried to claim insurance compensation through the court," the ASV said.
The problem, of course, is conceived.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, because they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If the instrument were not insured in the ASV, it would also ban metal accounts, on which the funds of citizens are counted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one has tried their existence yet.
The fact is, most likely, that the certificates on the presenter are a very convenient securities that can actually act as quasidene.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, pass on to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must necessarily be a specific securities, which should be stored in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early repayment.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable contribution is introduced, which the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
“Stephen Fearklaw watched for us over the weekend and talked to protesters who came from everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State group, Itar-Tass reported on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It is reported that Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 assault rifles G3 and G36.
The deliveries will be completed by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On September 1, Ms Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to the hotspots.
The views of the residents of the Federal Republic of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militias hit Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, reports Itar-Tass on August 31.
According to available data, this occurred in Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is clarified that the incident took place today at about 16:20 pm.
Adolescents were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenagers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set out for a trek shortly after noon on Sunday at Govets Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, which included local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale Waterfall.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on a swing on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in a stable condition to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met.
The negotiations at the summit in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian.
Despite the alarming (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerating delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot problems".
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions about this fell off on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw in the news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of politeness, it was the behavior of a man who just broke the jackpot – and plans decent old age in higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk at once of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimacy of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Meliantsov, senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to be defrosted,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough began long before the November Maidan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“The results have been achieved with the EU – these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization – and negotiations on international security have been held with the United States.
The U.S. has lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only clinged to this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all rigor, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue – and assessed it, Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification will be, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to host meetings in the format of the EU+TS.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was not able to quickly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in a new format.
Ashton spokeswoman Maya Kosyancic has just said that in the context of resolving war and peace issues, this issue is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The cappuccino for Minsk became the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that it turns out that he was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not against Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings both in the format of Russia--OSCE--Ukraine, and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is gaining the status of a fully handcuffed European leader who is helping to solve the global problem.
Best Friend of a Farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main backbone of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the timing of future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the fears of the TC countries on the association agreement of Ukraine with the EU seems to be a larger achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, said EU officials “came to Minsk to look for a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around.”
It seems, however, that in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine "works" for Belarus.
Its consequences - and, first of all, the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuvering.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, former Belarusian presidential candidate Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus’ possibilities for supplying agricultural products to the Russian Federation in order to circumvent sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are proposed, for which Vladimir Putin rushed Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk emphasized, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, continues the expert, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not afraid to set up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very in demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for EU and CT negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may propose to Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This can raise Lukashenko’s authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality Without Initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format is revoked, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague emphasized that Kiev has become the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay-barahta to make a decision, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to understand the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," - he addressed the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to appease Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic service carefully emphasizes that Belarus, in organizing the EU and TS cooperation on its land, does not pursue self-interesting goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other spheres, in particular in the sphere of security, promotes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation", - said "The fire" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, where recently carefully selected words.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The government of Moscow considers the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating the congestion of central roads in analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has proven itself successful is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the disadvantages and advantages.
To talk about the fact that some decisions have been made about this, until early," - said Liksutov.
Zammara stressed that for the authorities of the capital, the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and load, is very important.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that all traffic does not necessarily pass through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure for the roundabout, then there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," Zammara said.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the ceremony of marking the construction of the first launcher complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Boredom is sinful.
Frank Miller’s and Robert Rodriguez’s “City of Sins 2: A Woman for Whom It’s Worth Killing” weren’t the kind of revolutions that could be expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary fiction.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the chain fundamental to modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if you understand by the thesis the universe of noar, and by the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
Henceforth it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
The "City of Sins 2" is chaotic both at the dramaturgical and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar to the first "City", although, here, Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only has time to catch - as such a folk friend - from the air knives and other axes with strangles.
But the old people are literally pushed by the elbows of newcomers, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and the plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly torn by the authors in the most interesting place, by the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is with the greedy and frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something revengeful to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, is indistinguishable from Johnny – especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, are treated with unrelenting regularity by the characters – is not a problem or even a half-defeat.
These are not people, we understand that these are the archetypes of nuara: a rock bitch, a self-confident player, a "honey trap" sex detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's not a movie anymore, but read that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
There is also something permanent even in this sunny world.
Fighting whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the besieging their home slums of the dark forces.
Yes, and the ghost of Detective Hartigan no-no, and will look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem of the "City of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at comic-books as a talented comic-book artist and as a director he turned the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and nuar are two aggressively opposite "realities".
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when Dashil Hammett's novels "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of noara, which was then called the hard-boiled school.
Or Pulp Fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seaman Popeye, a spinach eater, giving him heroic power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "vengers".
But in any comic book movie there was something damaging: the characters diligently did not want to grow up in the screen flesh, they remained pretending in their surrounding will-worship "real" world.
Simply put, they were purely deprived of “existence.”
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and a historical background - has lost all credibility.
What Forsythes, what Tibo and Rugon-Makkara, what even the Bolkons and Rostovs are generally conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned on his skin what it is to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Lawsey, and Edward Dmitry.
Therefore, the nuar, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and, secondly, purely social.
This is hardly an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it is unnatural, but organically combined the comic book with black.
For the first time on the screen, the comic revived, not ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" movie.
The darkness of a corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murder and the senator covered the monster son-sadist, was quite worthy of the pen of Hammett.
And the picturesque details like the cut heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the feathers of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseating - representative of the neon.
"City of Sins 2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical stylistics of Miller-Rodrigues to the tradition of comics.
This is largely due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside which the snow sleeps a toy toilet.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scabs, but in general, what is the difference?
There is nothing to say about socialism.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the edge of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who has walked the curved path or, say, tell the discouraged parents that her loser is punished.
When there is no place for sin in the city, there is no place for sin except sin, and sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
It's boring, like any norm.
The chaos of "City of Sins-2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rental has given this fresh sin a little, but a little parsley.
Titles warn: The film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the spectacle, in the very vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken with pinches, this gives a hell of a sense of humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France's Socialists Should "Shut Up and Put France in Order", Says Key Ally of Frasoua Hollande
Mr. Vall called on the deeply divided left forces to “demonstrate a warm attitude” toward the attacking socialist president, whose realignments did not find the approval of the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay close to him,” he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “one” with the government.
However, Christian Tobera, the justice minister, put sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissident members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, has expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among socialists, saying she does not imagine the new Wall Street government will last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valls, forced to assemble a new government when the previous summer did not last.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter either," Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for parliament to be dissolved, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and is ready to govern.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions by the end of Mr Hollande’s 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Syances Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
“City Without Drugs” Has Been Unclaimed
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court has left without consideration the application of the administrative directorate of the regional Ministry of State Property Management to the "City Without Drugs" fund.
The Office intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles as a fee for the rental of a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitral tribunal of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles as a fee for the rental of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, which is why it was decided to refuse consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the directorate of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
There was also no contact with the Fund.
We will remind, we are talking about the mansion, which was occupied by a fund in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
Such a decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the expulsion of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the unconcluded contract of free use of the premises of the monument mansion.
According to the directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the rental of the cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, then an appeal was filed to the 17th Permian Arbitration Court, which was satisfied.
Then, in the same court, the foundation filed a cassation appeal against the decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court accepted the side of the direction.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, under which the fund again began to pay the rent, the head of the city, Evgeny Roizman, said.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region has given us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided otherwise,” he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the Yekaterinburg pride unit Alexander Kosintsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the proud speaker Evgeny Roizman to resign.
The occasion was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of the murder of the retired deputy Oleg Kinev, considered an accomplice of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "defamation" (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, the director-general of the legal center "Defense" addressed the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in her blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
iPhone turned into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to unveil its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
According to sources, the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of the new products on September 9, Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new smartphone iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The company itself declines any comment on the matter.
This function allows you to make a payment at the cashier of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user using his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time incorporate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote the technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts emphasize that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in advancing NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their stores.
France's Foreign Ministry: Paris's position on Mistral supplies to Russia does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Roman Nadal said on Tuesday that Paris’s unchanged position on Russia’s supply of Mistral-type helicopter carriers is unchanged.
"I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande) made by him in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde of August 20: "Today the level of sanctions does not impede delivery.
This is a decision of the Europeans, not of France,” Nadal told RIA Novosti.
The representative of the French foreign policy department answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change of the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruises Closes to $3 Billion Deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruises, a $6.8 billion market value company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp. (CCL).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations are not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue amounted to $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to have a positive impact on the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
The racing companies are striving to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the primary public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850-million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a publicly traded company in January 2013.
Genting held a 28 percent stake, Apollo a 20 percent stake, and private investment firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents for the first public placement of Prestige Cruises shares.
Television company "Crimea" can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the state-run TV radio company "Crimea" in 2014.

Also, the money will go to the purchase of equipment, repair of the roof and energy supply systems in the building of the television and radio company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement cancel the speech of the Chinese representative the day after the decision on the election
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People's Representatives on Sunday determined a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 election of the head of Hong Kong.
All candidates must first get the support of a majority of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision made it nearly impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot box and prompted activists of the democratic movement to once again promise to stop the financial center of Hong Kong with protests "Occupy Central".
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control of Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a particular administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city’s business center and staged a sit-in strike.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Rongshun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China Assembly of People's Representatives, and Feng Wei, deputy director of the Bureau of Hong Kong and Macau State Council, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activists said they would gather at the Hong Kong government’s head of state building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150-year colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian autonomy
Israeli authorities have announced plans to add 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to join the country by South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said on Sunday that it had taken over the territory and instructed the military to set up an administrative office in the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip Saib Arikat, the world public should call on Israel to answer for “continuing settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin demands Kiev to start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the partitioned region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine must be reviewed in order to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian insurgents as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give back to the newly proclaimed “Novoterror”.
In an interview with the state-run First TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the occupied territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for the parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a "prisoner of illusion".
"We must immediately start substantive negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to appease fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s intervention to correct Putin’s “misinterpretation” of the words underlined the Russian leadership’s decision to behave in relation to the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2-million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are non-Russian, and surveys prior to the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, giving the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the main Russian navy, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers weigh amendments to the constitution after the new elections, allowing divided regions to give more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to agree with separatist leaders as equals followed a new offensive by rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russia-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say fears is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory to Crimea itself.
This resulted in large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko appealed to the European Union leaders’ meeting in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any specific measures; leaders called for a draft tougher sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Security Council and a national security spokesman.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his bride, Gaby Greco, and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of frank photos depicting naked Jennifer Lawrence came online as a result of a large-scale hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 frank photos of the star of the “Hunger Games” Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who made Greco's offer last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is horrifying that personal information can be stolen and shared with other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking attack was “shameful” and that those targeted “feel they have been invaded.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots where she lies by the pool with her naked breasts.
Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the movie "Chuck" Insurance and the actress from "Forbidden Reception" Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Spokesman Lawrence told TMZ: “This is a sudden invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Publishing photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different than selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities has been discovered
Massive hacking of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential development scenario was described by The Next Web.
The Github resource released a script in Python that allowed you to select passwords for Apple’s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
To access it, the same bundle of Apple ID and password is used as for accessing the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the search method to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all kinds of combinations of symbols are consistently entered, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options entered in the Find My Phone service is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and notify the user of the hack attempt.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about an attempt to retrieve the password for their account.
The hackers learned the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and it was written by a scripting program to select passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but he noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the account "stars".
It's not me, plz RT
The Prime Minister's Twitter once again appeared foreign posts
While there is no strong evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious actions using this service before.
The hackers intercepted control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the tweet of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has also been hacked.
If the attackers accessed iCloud in the way described above, the password for the head of government’s account in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web resource failed to receive comments from Apple about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.

SKR suspends investigation into Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (SKR) has terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the disaster was the increased speed of entry to the landing, non-compliance of the crew with the standard procedures on the landing, as well as the unintentional exit of the engines at increased direct thrust speeds.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of human beings.
Angry facial expression is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not random, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, researchers from Australia and the United States found.
They told about their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The expression of anger on the face is offset and dropped down the eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of lips, swollen nostrils are the same in all cultures, and are made even by birth blind children who have never seen it, says lead author Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion arose to effectively conduct disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
Researchers have found confirmation of another of their hypotheses: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and go to the practice, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavourable conditions on others, and also prefer forceful methods of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Drawing on the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining,” the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create the angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus cause the conflict conditions to agree with him as soon as possible.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on a computer the faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or absent, and showed them to informers.
Although the lowered eyebrows or protruding chins did not individually make the face angry, the study participants unanimously recognized the physically stronger person depicted with such traits.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own power, forcing one to agree and obey.
A person inflates the nostrils and presses the lips for the same purpose as a frog that is inflated, or a baboon that shows its claws.
Anger is triggered by the interlocutor’s refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tuby.
