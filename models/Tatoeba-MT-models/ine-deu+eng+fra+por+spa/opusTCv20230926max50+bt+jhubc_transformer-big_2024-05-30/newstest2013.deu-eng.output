A Republican strategy to oppose Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center believes the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that election fraud in the U.S. is less common than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the U.S. in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting elections in individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of U.S. governments have promulgated new laws that make the procedure for registration or polling more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance since the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which there is a judicial act.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states forcing voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identification card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible individuals, do not possess a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who increasingly vote for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the election cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in eight states in 2011 supported laws that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of new voter registration by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they made up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the laws passed and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the states that will decide for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral Commission to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater hesitation of the already undecided men to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of metastases forming is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, respectively, if you have a direct relative who has already suffered from prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of African-American descent.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made really understandable about the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options for which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases it is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment as the disease progresses.
It is increasingly accurate to determine the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not.
Therefore, I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most importantly, however, it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be performed.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, that would increase to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unclear.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is very damaging to people’s health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after giving up cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, small intestine, colon, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer,” he adds.
The Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much increases the risk of developing mammalian or colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family bias.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzing the Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely certain about it.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that this is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let’s look at what it’s all about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be in the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to break this rule – and don’t try too hard because you’ll hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", with this "state" consisting in large part of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons are moving, an evil band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not treat here, and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "particle of light", which is the "boat" of electromagnetic force.
That is, when a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly in this place, in about like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "interference" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable Field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is needed – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator on its own.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do possess a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not possess a mass.
What can all this research be "good" for now, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately investigate all deviations between the observations and predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who most hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major flaws, since it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (ups!).
However, no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Consequences
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was more of a "laboratory plaything" at first.
You can imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as an “eye” for all digital cameras worldwide and won it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its Committee on Dying in Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a tasty lunch, he resignedly agrees to let himself be helped to eat.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is for you to cure my diarrhea because it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees while standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step back," he notes.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, major events are taking place amidst these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t have any desires in life anymore,” she says, before accepting that a mask is put on to help her breathe.
In the coming days, she is still waiting for the last visit of her son, who is from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provide physical care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
That's very little, considering that one day we'll all die.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given an oral care with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died overnight.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help relatives and patients alike,” says Nathalie Savard, the care director.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his pillows as he is honored, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal Area, are more or less exclusively specialized in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this large inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes several palliative care specialists to worry about the passing of a law regulating assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to switch to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without any measures taken to relieve her.
I am afraid that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients bitterly until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were minimal when she discontinued severe chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I gave up the fight, she said.
However, she told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver for not fulfilling this wish after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal Area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which results in the patient falling asleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
This report was made possible by a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Major Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction agency, construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafiosos are entangled.
An “industry” that was very expensive for Quebec’s taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has broken down since drastic measures were taken," joked Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the abuses in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he stresses, “the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts,” because some were restraining their instincts to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already taken down two mayors," he adds, hoping it will succeed in "demonstrating the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau Troupe", which since 2009 has caused the Montreal Canalisation Cartel to act with restraint in the artificial inflating of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has been conducting house searches and raising accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving smear money in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly charged.
The latter sparked controversy by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the award of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by giving more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68.000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal vice-president, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the cost of which has been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, whose costs he was required to pay.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of intentionally overlooking a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she rebelled from 2010 against the sale of a municipal plot that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that is ultimately being carried out, she says she “pulls on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system migrated by ants to stop the evil and to denounce the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigation unit, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all thinks about the role of "mandataries who are in the picture about the tactics", if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a share of 70% of black money in funding Quebec’s election campaigns, he jokes: “I was told this is just a faint applause of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which, according to it, would change nothing to the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing the parties: "We cannot go deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on your side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of play.
And with a game, it is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions this summer are accustomed to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that each training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to offer the front and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course. Yeah.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken us the place of the top rider.
But we are in hiding.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group ahead of Porto, so that we can play back the eighth final as a home game.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the funds to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something that you can blame us for, it’s certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what else people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has been unable to qualify for the semi-finals for two seasons, and who has also made huge expenditures!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Even better, we are talking about a "golden dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That’s why he came and he proves he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has kept in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from losing some playing time.
I have seen things from which I have grown stronger.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Blues".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we need to show an exemplary attitude.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Blues"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, stands close to the players and encourages to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Blues" to Brazil.
Is the forced draw (1:1) in Spain on 16 October a start game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
“Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success”, “competiting with the dollar or euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously bookkeepers, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are present in the account book of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to record this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divisible by up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a certain leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had highs and lows.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for real money payments and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind of money.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blogging platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-lock sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a company that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to rethink hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, in its report, the ECB envisages reassessing the various risks that are today highly regarded in the event of the success of this currency.
We have moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with the help of French loans, was carried out properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflowing with helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of Taliban into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by the fighting of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by seizing government land to sell it as a construction site to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They have defamed themselves, and most of them were not themselves involved in the struggles.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of the American grants: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose authority they will be placed be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already striving for the restoration of the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization at the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karza<0xC3><0xAF> does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams have not existed, and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense soil treasures.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, let international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig into the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s main employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls’ and boys’ secondary schools, French Institute at universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been led by a small French non-governmental organization to try to achieve the tasks of openness and openness of the minds and minds.
These works, which required numerous local workers, have been able to help suppress the uprising: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free the farmers from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, it would be necessary to continue with lesser, well-controlled and directly related civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution with the Crusher Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in terms of the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional, multiple-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only resulted in an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “walk the law.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the president, it’s also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest unfolds across the country.
Following confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
With this resort to a hasty vote, the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum: “Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney”, the latter supposedly should end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not respond to the call.
Shortly before the declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they turned away because they felt they had not been able to put their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
To achieve decision-making capacity, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace “the principles” with “the rules”, which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Philosophy” is the answer of the liberals, who view this only as a propaganda attack.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
They have particularly in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, as "the people who are asked to take a stand have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see in this the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticised for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have demanded.
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The act of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch stresses that the article no longer refers to the protection of women.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Worship in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding party, walking on the water, breastfeeding the seastorm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to His disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries are in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the path of suffering or crossing of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Wall of Lamentation, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave cards with wishes, which then come true.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an airlift to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach it by a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Judean desert are preserved, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is on display.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking section is the Children’s Memorial, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
At the entrance to the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the children of the Jews and of the countries where they died shall be heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Doing something for health
Israel’s three most important recreational areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content and therefore even non-swimmers carry it easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and healing sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of hardened nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to wander through the narrow streets, which are named after signs of the zodiac.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend according to everyone who touches the walls in the street with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, the carefully restored theatre hosts evening concerts and operas.
List of attractions for tourists
When you drive to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily converted into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed train and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
To be exact, it is an underground cable car.
A drive within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a drive of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, peel-free fish and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hamel and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falabel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats who roam the streets cozy and unhindered.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
Cats like lively places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land, which is an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While lawmakers and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force that requires every migrant to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, the tests are expected to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
In doing so, you need to pass not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Language proficiency must be demonstrated both for obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problems and protection of rights
All of the examinations will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question in the press several times before the law came into force: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to demonstrate language proficiency bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, oppose spokesmen of the migration authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future immigrant without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions, who will put him under the guise of help in a dark, narrow barracks where he will endure dozens of months of his own without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
There are a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"In your homeland, you will be promised one thing, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken off and you will not receive the promised salary," said Tolib Schwaripov, head of the Tajik Migration Agency.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make money in Russia, admit that they are not only unable to speak the language of the target country, but also can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only immigrants with legal status are required to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Entry prohibited for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this then results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Umed Huschkadamov told reporters.
"Don't scare the cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some forged certificates that certify the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Immigration Authority.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for free: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than double the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both civil servants and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be bought easily.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who pass the test for the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active contact with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Weapons Market
Proportion of legal weapons in crime is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the gun laws for private gun owners.
This is how the authorities react to the recent events: wounded in the shootings at weddings and seven dead in the amok of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, calling on the authorities to refrain from "senseless exacerbations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice officer, Wasilij Lesnikov, to the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes using registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period, a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals from using themselves on the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, you can find any kind of weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
Weapons can reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police’s weapons chambers and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
At many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a firefight to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, gun manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that can't withstand international competition and therefore squander their weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia that organizes the smuggling," the former military member explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of "responsible people who have managed to deal with weapons in their work," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop, who doesn’t want to be named, assures that weapons found at illegal excavations have long since been bought outdated.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to get supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A weapon, for example a TT-type pistol, is purchased via a flag line.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police are, of course, aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, they periodically conduct control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find out about acquaintances with each other.
I had been looking at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would be waiting for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and make an appointment with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m even getting a few hitting rings about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the percussion rings because he knows I don't bite him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines display search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed and there are no personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," says the ad on the website "Buy combat gun or rifle".
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Iwan" (literally quoted).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go up to the service on the net.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military Commentator and Former Military Member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The managers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislow, a spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie".
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end, you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go up to the service on the net.
“People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts say prices range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a pistol of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by medium-range overseers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes with illegal weapons in all of Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. Fast Food and Supermarket Employees Strike
One in four U.S. teenagers sits behind the checkout desk at Mc Donald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing charities.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food employees, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the U.S., which attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to hand sweeps.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and, together with unions and left-wing activists, enlisted branches of the chain whose target group is low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only shop at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the protests on "Black Friday" called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they currently donate for wages.
If Walmart were to completely reverse the pay increases on customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, that would be a yearly increase of only $12.39 compared to today’s spending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there were protests in only nine states, and these did not inflict any losses on the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday through midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cashiers performed nearly 100 million transactions on “Black Friday”.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the Huffington Post’s left-wing website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees quit the job and the protest was just “another PR trick” by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are undesirable in this progressive city and therefore not existing so far), but McDonald’s and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour under federal and New York law.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too high, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get out in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all U.S. teenagers were behind the counter after school at McDonald’s, but the teenagers still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly encounter people who complain that they have to cope with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal and advising or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you're not going to pay for your work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the fast food staff so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of which by far not all are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be overwhelmed moderately so far"
The topic of augmented reality, popular among followers of modern technologies, has recently been commonly perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It encourages the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is conducting.
- We are concerned with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely remained stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are progress, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays out on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this by working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more comprehensible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this stupid virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about his actions and intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and narrow rather than exhaustive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesture and language.
- What do you mean?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this spray can?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot do at the time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approximation.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work in particular on the development of new sensor types that will allow us to more accurately capture people’s reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make on modern cameras based on your work with Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly the same device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or aggravate the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how that helps us determine a three-dimensional position.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of applying the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in your hand on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality in which we could switch from a cloud of glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in it lies their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an augmented reality using glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
“Let’s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all.
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could quite well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually geared towards giving the “images in the air” something handy, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently but still as weak as someone breathing over the wrists.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, too, which is a potential direction.
- Did you try to fool the brain?
Let it think that it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task with which we will have to struggle for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), large movable platforms.
So far, the brain can only be overwhelmed moderately, and we still have many hard-working years ahead of us.
That’s what makes work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: We are only beginning with many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the chosen list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who can be found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous figure of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s respectively.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street enchants his fellow citizens with a smile on their faces and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently he picked up a turntable and became a Petersburg turntable player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates somewhat from the grey norm produces aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Kulturpalast Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters at the time came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevshina"; from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only finished.
I am attracted to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything except literature.
It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should come together.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of the Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovation works.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
String and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and included the now-fashioned composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
That’s where our employees and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and with that I reached the pinnacle.
It is not easy to work by old rules in new times; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be so.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by requiring everyone to dress completely.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not to the inside of the person.
But perhaps one should not give a hand to a man, but should spit in his face.
Deception disappears through disguise.
- We just saw you in the role of the city's horn player. - A culture town should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But the performances of Stas Mikhailov come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, consequently there is less management, money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted paintings that even hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They say they are servants of culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In St. Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are being blocked because they need higher-level experts who will evaluate the first ones correctly and open the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient base.
On our stones, art can only hardly grow.
We need a cultural foundation, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it is much less.
Art has to be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth-inhabitants on board are on a quest to find a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises, how can we breed in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"These are Mars and Venus," says Wladimir Surdin, a research fellow at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the issue of reproduction in space in terms of flora.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were already carried out.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the earthly species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guard eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chick needs to find a hold; it needs to be able to stand on its legs and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, laboratory director of the RAN Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
Without a solid base, the chicks overlapped wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely blurred.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then we stopped the whole thing because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized sent to space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our moose flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Will it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," said space veteran Waithang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Terechkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Savizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must find new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolaboratory in the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
Water is the weightlessness.
Although adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; however, infants feel that water is a natural element.
It’s as if the little Ichtyanders testify that life on land went out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother’s womb in the amniotic fluid, and the fact that it can then become more easily accustomed to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim just 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenova.
While for a newborn child gravity is a much more natural state, the woman does not go without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form enormously quickly, and thus the ability to push the child out also decreases.
All right, let's get around the birth aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth’s attraction, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a loading suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is essential to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will cause us to give birth to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person,” says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the RAN Institute for Medical-Biological Problems.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it becomes a reality when the Earthlings in their spaceships depart for a distant planet that will become the home for their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: control of the black system failed by fault of politics
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controls and adequate laws, but falls short in their application.
In the interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Authority (NJC), Miloslav Kala, says this.
“A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly – and I think that’s not the case with us,” Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint check by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the Prime Minister cannot simply come, and the control body, whose duty it is now to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of the two countries regarding public procurement were compared.
What was that concrete about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of European legislation defining how public procurement should be handled, which is the basis of national legislation and, finally, the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this, and although the examination is not yet completed, we were able to find extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws with us may even be a bit "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
It is precisely such a common control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to lower and align thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve that goal either.
Perhaps it is even that we are only burdening the system with excessive paperwork in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system will have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college, which is formed only slightly differently, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are also these courts in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the county courts.
As far as the German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information, but Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, although it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Is it because the auditors are better?
I’m not sure, but like I said, I don’t really like comparisons like that.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to do with our agency, would they?
As for the Czech legislation, what was the significance for your authority of the modernization of the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
Given that this novella is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our tests.
Since our checks take place afterwards, a certain delay must be expected here.
So far, we are more likely to have an impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of uneconomicity" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts are examined and analyzed - here the changes will of course have an effect, as the thresholds have been changed, the conditions for certain types of contracts have been changed.
Do you see the passage of this law more positively, or is the system burdened with more bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, those subject to an audit are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in the sense that any non-compliance with the award law amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect actual decision making.
Such a system merely puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let’s start by saying which path is not the right one.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not illuminate the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
After all, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the Prime Minister cannot simply come, and the Office of Control, whose duty it is now to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing,” but he can’t say that we act as if there were nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I believe is lacking.
There are occasional ice sheets on the streets, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice.
However, mostly the roads are well-traveled, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were easily accessible this morning, with occasional snow and ice slush.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, it should get a little warmer during the day.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the combs of the Erzgebirge Mountains.
According to the district highway guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The highway R6 and the first-class roadways in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roadways are sometimes jagged and smooth.
All roads of the second and third class roads, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, there are sectionally ekreated or skidded snow residues.
Therefore, increased attention is required, especially in the higher levels.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger due to ice sheets, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes a layer of snow on the roads.
The road championships warn drivers of ice sheets, which can occur especially in higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
In particular, ice can be found on roads of the second and third class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extensive layer of snow lies at altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or rainy, mostly without precipitation.
The temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
District of Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now easily accessible, but local attention is needed, and the driving pattern must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
As it snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, there may be ice slush on the roads.
Fog is also expected locally, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district street championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention recommends the road championships between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The first-class roadways are predominantly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there can be partial ice melt.
The roads of the second and third class roads are wet, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible sections ekrydee.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc (district)
Today, drivers travelling in the direction of the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to count on snowmatch.
After the use of scattering vehicles, Snowmatsch remains on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass as well as on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Nightly snow driving forced the road championships to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there is still snow in the altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowfall towards Jeseník," an employee of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Even her colleagues in the Jeseník district had to go out at night, according to her, the roads are free and wet up to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads can be driven without restrictions, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district, drivers must drive with caution in forest sections, as the roads here are still damp.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several badly transited sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain below zero, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads. On the other hand, there are no problems reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and the roads there are usually dry.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí district.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless skies and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the I/13 road at the border of the districts of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.L. and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice was blocked due to branches pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think the end of the world is going to be in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national charity event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, from 21:00, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is expected to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in a time zone.
Where did this idea come from?
Originally from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once handed over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called Anthem against the End of the World titled "The End of the World".
Already today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound at the charity concerts?
Of course, and at the end of the day, assuming everything works and the end of the world does not happen...
The anthem is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are broadcast live on Czech TV in a live circuit.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charitable events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible educational center Studeo, where we have been working together with the Tap Association at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be built, in which we will move in with this project.
At each concert there are several groups and performers.
On what criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the US - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry a lot of instrumental suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, which I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnessing that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is not for people with disabilities, and it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to be alone in the city centre.
It is not even self-evident that a wheelchair user is given a lecture, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we hang in the back...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use the toilets, etc.
However, it is not very common for a larger group of people with disabilities to be actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caregiver at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I have founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Lá<0xC4><0x91>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, tends to say, something gets out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively advertise for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you are doing something and it is not visible to the outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and more.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In the show business today, they often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the spectator usually has is, of course, compassion; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
However, I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly fades.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x91>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
Venues include: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and there is a joint interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang fällt aus" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional educational centre suitable for people with disabilities, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available for pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a Council of Ministers meeting, making it the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish cosmonauts were engaged in space travel, but they did not always come across this as a matter of understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "The entrance to cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entry to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important proponent of astronomy and space.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the Earth-facing side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railroad draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-operated shots.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down, it can be seen that the research has progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket originating from Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work "Raketa - torpedo azyhna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauticze) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society was made in the November issue of Problemy magazine in 1954, which devoted four extensive articles to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of an aerospace company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite engineering projects, and it was anticipated that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów Desert with the two-stage missile RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was stopped.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rocket three types were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport compartment with 0.4 litres of capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland’s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later by the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second Interkosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Profit Work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Law on Non-Profit Works.
This decision sparked a lively debate in the public eye.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wages), there are price tensions.
This term refers to a situation in which the producer attempts to compete by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" competition in order to obtain a greater market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy cheaply there, or to give up their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility and hence no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the gentlemen's unwillingness to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damages they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments hand over their own people to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the rich and the poor.
For several years now, there have been public food donations for the poor in Germany who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own labor.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low salary that the state must raise their income to the minimum standard of living.
Such a scandal has also been uncovered in the case of auxiliary personnel employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly end up in the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that private capital will be invested.
Naturally, this raises the question of where this capital comes from.
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the utmost that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own economy, and that the planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists tightly on its position that the state should not intervene in the economy by directing.
But then one must ask whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual favoritism, legislation in which virtually everything is punishable but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, in the absence of finance, a State Ministry commissions private law firms closely intertwined with the industry to draft legislation.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as proclaimed by the Western constitutions, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently the liberal democracies are now quickly falling into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in decay, and the offices have been occupied by force.
Against lubrication money, through illegal blurring of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew indiscriminately, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "People of character did not apply for offices, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decadence" ... "It was already really started to talk about the fact that the only medicine used in this difficult situation was c...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the reckless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already, by its very nature, incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current state of affairs, the collapse of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites face the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase the citizens’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are" .
“If my sons did not want war, there would be no war,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, a number of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others in turn support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and describe the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is the culprit and who is the victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; in the end, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
My goal is to open the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, the eyes of whom the 95 years of excitement (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are primarily at their service.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these facts and emerge from my own understanding of who or what group of people influences the events of modern history significantly.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can designate an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who guided their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one in particular, which you could call the head of the Kraken (I don't know if anyone else stands over them, but I don't rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s in order to prevent their name from being linked to highly criminal acts, the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the multiplication of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or arm themselves against them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi's bank remained only four, while Russia remained in its Z time).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan in 1859-1871 to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and hence the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war should be broken especially the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war is supposed to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would not provide for their comforts and their luxury here).
The method by which the group of the wealthiest families with the Rothschilds at the top works is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed so that crises like the ones they triggered in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the assassination of the Habsburg successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire, war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the start of the Second World War, the bankers had to create a latent situation of conflict through politics, occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the prerequisite of impoverished masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader with a simpler solution, which owes the state.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the settled Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was torn from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will, like in World War II, become victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply people divide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
One must distinguish here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as us, the people, exclusively their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of the world’s fascist economy, the international bankers loyal to politicians who do everything to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could only come about 20% of the world’s population.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it causes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, all to give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one may buy or sell, but he who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom; let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The Movie Argo: When the Worst Is Calling Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they called for the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free the hostages only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home evoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who allegedly visited the country’s filming locations for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by "Exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Hussar piece such as the movie Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film vary - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly spiked therefore.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official floors, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable restart of his career.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not to feature in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that made the director’s previous films stand out from Hollywood’s standard.
Affleck, however, also demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story takes place.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film staff at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
However, he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes reminiscent of reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its over-spreading, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserved more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film thus loses some traction, a film that can be followed with a certain interest, while dripping the design and retro style that reminds of a 70s thriller.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is alive to this day in a certain way and as proof of how overwhelming the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls out a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea was brought to us by the recent plan put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% women's share in the management of major European companies," Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women had an advantage in life insurance because they posed objectively a lower risk to the insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013,” said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include the mandatory mixing of bioethanol with fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, due to which egg whites have become unusable this year.
Criticism has also in the past harvested the factual ban on the use of the term "butter coating" or also the ban on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that trade and industry lobby whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests also argued that the highest class of bananas in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
The fruit and vegetable standards have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, noting that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to air balloons on sale must be provided with the notice that children under eight years of age are not allowed to inflate the air balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study, which according to air balloons is the leading cause of suffocation in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market truffles.
Curious ideas are also available at home
It is also relatively absurd that a directive affects European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official position in the EU should not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and should instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Let Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
For example, the Czech Republic exceeded the fixed volume for mushroom cans, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state stockpiles were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally reached out to the Czech Republic to organise a tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), offered grants for grant applications to the municipalities, specifically if they were to be funds for the preparation of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole are more commendable.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing at all to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products is also evoked by emotions in this country and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the inland rum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or the Parma ham now also includes the Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can breastfeed.
“People want me to save the republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura said.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the republic being looted for 20 years, thieves roaming around freely, while people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I’m over 40, and independent and partyless, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then immediately set out on your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your back on your constituents?
I told myself all along that I would take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function; the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people slander in the pub and in front of the TV, but we smash anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of your honor and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to be bribe journalists or advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle was started with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective statements of assets of over 20 million crowns.
You have to change the laws for that.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have advocated for the guide to remain a free trade, and this has been enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left comes up with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party member, I have a far greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without any shoelaces and party ideologies from any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more to the right or to the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more to the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
I don’t care if anyone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don’t like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the suggestions I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
Without the support of Parliament, however, you will only be left with slogans.
In the long run, you won’t get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the leaders of parliamentary parties on live television to legally enshrine material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the respondents would have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to abuse can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can’t achieve anything alone; that’s why I’ve talked to several well-known personalities about whether they want to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of work overload.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate did not go to the elections at all, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of any potential party member, and I don’t have the money at all.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what did yours look like?
My private assets are estimated at around CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few more million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I’ve invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator’s salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I would run for nothing.
So, do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this is not related to the level of salary.
As promised, I have partially withdrawn my activities.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still the case.
As president, however, I would completely stop my efforts.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town hardly to visit at the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-population municipality has the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as nicely brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still staring at itself in dismay and hunched back, the daring Maas piled up his exquisite coin of the size of a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear City Council!"
So this is my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bookberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain has exploded.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town restaurant, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unfathomable ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: book dorado under cheese bell.
There is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the real pleasures of space and reading open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights unmistakably speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
Everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on top of the head and tilted the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the library is well used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black book shelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes armor, sometimes climbing railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even incarnate architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse Municipality, at the request of the standard.
And so one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the garbage.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a shoe.
After 105 steps, you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre hike, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bucherberg is under a glass fall, the sun shines only briefly inside even on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which are transverse to the glass facade, serve as a shade and capture much of the sun’s rays.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “long overdue soul”.
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
For the first time, the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has been taken up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-liter library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for decoration.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called in professional jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
No matter how young and unskilled she may be.
This is finally a point of view for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
What's that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to its special relationship with Israel, Germany must now be cautious.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently transforming its foreign policy away from a policy that was managed by the United States, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to add that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans, therefore, find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still getting closer to their role, but they are on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like they have France or Britain.
What does “normal” foreign policy mean in Germany?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to confront the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will even show some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into consideration.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has vetoed it.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that under Obama, the government secretly has quite a lot of understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I don’t think the actual differences are as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and on the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still taking a tough lead?
Germany is not used to it yet, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a larger role, various anti-German sentiments are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be responsive to a variety of neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don’t like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular – c’est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name that is officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
Even then, it is unclear if they are right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in copyright infringements in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few extra letters are enough for the imitators to register their trademarks.
Thus, from Gucci, it is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have to enter Prada Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in intellectual property infringement.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch’s cases, however, are different: on behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere by the trademark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
I mean women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is being diluted, the stand alone disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial outages and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed complaints because after a long period of time, the contested name became a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he would even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated its trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing admits that there have been shortages in 2010 due to the lack of staff and room facilities.
Last year, however, they returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending in the office.
To deal with it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide, the official said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were levied.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To deal with this costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
It has failed to do so because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO rejected the Munichers’ objection.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company’s archives even had to look through 100-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost even threaten to swing back to Europe.
That is, if imitators secure unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it was able to turn away from registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should “register everything that is somehow worthy of protection, even in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the opposite party licensing fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, Aidswaisen are delighted.
The story of a connection that crosses well over 8,733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the clock on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell up - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, bewitch and chase each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost pulls it out of his shoes when he brings them together with his softly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have come from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations’ AIDS programme.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one can but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, bringing them back from time to time to where they originally came from: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are infected with the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, the smallest thing that affects all of Swaziland is: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying in their mid-30s is not uncommon.
During a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was still the private commitment of an individual to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken almost professional care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitals or hepatitis.
Felt lice and ticks belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet around 20 percent of new HIV infections belong to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Human papillomaviruses are also common among adolescents.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, problems urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In some cases, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gags that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the club's president.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the backbones of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, giving them a roof over their heads and making sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school every day.
Whoever has no one else comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid as much by the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have to have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to silence it dead.
A king with 14 wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it’s strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms in every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together through South Africa every two or three years, singing songs full of courage, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already wiped out a few tears for some angry border guards.
The trip also leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their stepchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," the people there say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg with the 8733 kilometers of air line, to the stumbling singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can also see it shining there.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly even asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, chief scientist of the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to the earth: small gullholes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition.
This image of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are recognizable as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the constellation.
This star-forming region — called unromantic W5 by scientists — has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star pulled out in the process of dying.
In the huge trifid nebula, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the helix nebula on this infrared photo looks at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the trifid nebula in the constellation Schütze, several thousand light-years away.
The name trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-split, three-split), as dark dust strips triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies collide and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The star cradle always produces new youngsters.
Also, these star clouds, coupled with the Rosette Nebula, are continuously producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger – and the insights they provide have grown deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows glances into space equal over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.
In fact, despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes its name all the honor.
With a total of four mirrors, the binoculars can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to cover a total of 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures are expected in 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them still looks up into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is to be created a new, huge telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here it is to be amazed at an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The last launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space in 2018 at the earliest aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have been suggesting that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists now have certainty.
Drink Butter Every Day - and Become 168 Years Old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is called wild-romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the winding road, past densely forested hills, torn rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talychians, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town boasts an overly sophisticated architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, it is too difficult to get to the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one track.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest in May – and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talychs from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he turned 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age still seems extremely questionable.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he was said to have given birth to a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov settle for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
“There are strikingly many high-aged people in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men.”
However, due to the lack of documentation, there is no scientific evidence about the age, especially since there were no personal status registers.
Every day, melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are there so many high-paying people in the South?
The Aserian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talychians.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in the diet.
However, the fact that the high-calorie diet of the talismans is supposed to be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem very plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that relentlessly rolls her up and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two young children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in rank and file, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of my way and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought food at the supermarket once.
Then she tells about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II era.
But everything became better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the rudder.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the steer.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s elders.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions, an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grey son is right: “The old people enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalry rallies in Cairo reveal the country’s deep division.
The future constitution with Sharia as its basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly disputing in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile by the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said he had temporarily circumcised the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are about it, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judiciary be dismantled?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride are partly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What do you mean “principles”?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: in all matters pertaining to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn to it, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the dismissal of the judiciary.
Much in the draft is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military judiciary should be maintained.
These courts were used during Mubarak's rule to suppress oppositionists.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
According to the draft, the state should also "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values".
This is legally formulated so vaguely that state institutions could use this article to even control the contents of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious, the wording suggests that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as so much in the draft that Mursi submits for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual controversy on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to overthrow the charter before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belongs "to the garbage mountain of history".
Through short message service Twitter, he accused supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blew up to counter-demonstration, but cautiously not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many disguised women and followers of the Salafists took part and shouted, “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They demanded of Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have evoked civil war-like conditions.
Mursi’s supporters obviously didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the ballot box which direction the country should go in.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to go until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he lamented in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto repealing it," Saeda lamented.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, also by the international community, which sees the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You are raising a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And lay them there for a week.
You have to imagine the nose-drenching smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-sprayed trout, which is fermented in water for up to a year depending on how stink you would like your fish to be.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also hosts the festival as the so-called "Rakfisk-General".
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the raccoon fish," says Havard.
The spirits can suppress the smell.
I'm going to cost you a few bucks.
If you avoid bringing the raccoon close to the nose, it’s not bad — like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options and fish was drunk in airtight saltwater barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol-dampened senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important – as an essential, albeit strictly scented, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to mind.
Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year, is still hated here.
Instead, it refers only to the “July 22 incident”.
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has been mainly responsible for Norway’s current wealth.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays of ripe rake fish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a wise people.
Your English is perfect, just like most people here.
We're not very arrogant, we don't like bragging.
Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw money around them that they did not possess at all, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rake fish," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening the stinking fish is again on the menu.
The hotel I’m staying in is one of several venues that organizes a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging sense of smell – of fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
They clapped and laughed.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh fume of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC’s Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-closed city, but on Monday a steel ring was erected that blocks several major traffic routes to the capital and creates chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will hold the presidency and take over the nation’s leadership.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office to U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he stepped up with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represents a great improvement over the fragile, rugged roads that once existed here.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent politician, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was enlisted to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left on a patch of brachland near a large garbage dump.
During Governor Pena Nieto's tenure, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he at least did not adequately address the problem of women’s murders during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downtown area, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the stiffness had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears one word: justice.
But this is exactly what, according to the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me like I was a talker, a troublemaker, a nurse.
They want you to simply accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bid on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his tenure.
“I hope as president he is the way he was as governor,” says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutor's Office Says Bradley Manning Didn't Complain About Abuse
Prosecutor's Office Against Bradley Manning's Allegations of Being Abused in Prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge on the grounds of too harsh detention conditions
The U.S. Army Freedman is Accused of Stealing Thousands of Confidential Documents
The U.S. Attorney General’s Office on Friday tried to establish that Army-free Bradley Manning — accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history — failed to file several cases of military abuse.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Major Ashden Fein explained that records of weekly visits that prison officials had made during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the harsh term of detention - Manning had stated that he had contemplated suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been incarcerated under enhanced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Finn interviewed him on the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged treatment by his guards as "excellent" and treatment by the institution as "very professional" overall.
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints about abuse, although officials had interviewed Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning responded that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated to deal with them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) 'No problem', and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - one level under threat of suicide - to his own and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observational status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison of the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had contemplated suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what is happening to him or in the outside world has been stressful.
"My world shrank on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move because it was forbidden to sleep or even just lie down during the day.
He had always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could not see his face, they woke him up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he made in his statement on Thursday - he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the interview on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, having previously tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official he could have used the bandage of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his detention experience into account and drastically reduce his detention sentence should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is set for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offences, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend and the Prosecutor’s Office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the regulations that apply to all detainees detained in Quantico under the highest security measures.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, illegally publishing intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If found guilty on all charges, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants – they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport checkpoint when inconvenience spread within me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Ireland" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s homeland there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue for foreigners.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those topics that are expected when the minds of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is a reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartel, even though he did not give any details in this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership under guns to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the slightest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not given a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn’t see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now – with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans take this away from them.
While a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they don’t belong to either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should have learned during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to re-establish their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary “ambassadors” for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We want to tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Oh, well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in the face of unfair income distribution, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, friends.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual culprits, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed – and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were hit.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this mess.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patch situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate given the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the hardliners on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though his group itself has suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are trapped in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken up the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Rejoicing Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character may be facing the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are facing the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – the by far most populous and most important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains firmly committed to its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockades that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has joined an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians slander and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn’t they just fire rockets just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to make it through, but the Arab Spring could make a difference.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense is larger than its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That pragmatic President Mursi has teamed up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking cumbersome steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode into Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only exacerbate.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside.
The correct answer is one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: Two states where Israel is ceding territories for security purposes.
The small hope for the near future is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now halt arms supplies in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must contribute to pushing Israel into negotiations.
During his first term in office, he failed to come up with his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is equally reluctant to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packages that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing what parts of the body are sick and children affected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, is from Saturday onwards.
With this, Australia introduces the world’s strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at 26 are 99% more likely to stop smoking afterwards.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has risen enormously since the British American Tobacco Group, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan's Tobacco Corporation took over their lawsuit two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale stores and is awaiting new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hook lies in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from appearing as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop exposing cigarettes in stores. Now the tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned online advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and only have a small area left to promote their products don’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in reviews of brands written by “very normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even makes a video for it – or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries conducts major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show up defiantly.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a lever and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a picture printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to replenish its shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored once in a while.
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying – even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us—and our children—to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us nowadays are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this as such.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
Pompeii’s house walls adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to perform a satisfactory activity but not being able to do it.
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a “disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly.”
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Aspect of Attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment involving a magnifying glass.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content, others heard it at low volumes, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more boredom than the other two groups—they had trouble concentrating, couldn’t find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, you practice a monotonous activity - "like looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that apples and crumbs, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point – my delayed flight, a loudspeaker, a particularly tiresome film.
But some people get bored easier than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a “boring susceptibility scale” in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements like “Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida—particularly in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall prey to gambling or drugs to alleviate them – studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
When you are bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you become happy.
However, while television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, these flee again in the long term.
So if your child is bored with an iPad, he can get rid of the boredom, but he has not learned to talk or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we view them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant hustle and bustle of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to get involved once the noise is muted.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new Marijuana Act
19-year-old community college student and footballer Anthony Orozco faces trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of fewer marijuana scraps and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavalier offences each fined $100 - and was given a court appointment.
"We're being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for self-use, the response to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of law and order violations that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over 21 years for possession to a small extent, which will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative Colorado districts have announced they are continuing to prosecute existing marijuana crimes and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are agreeing to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so rapidly that I don’t even know what’s going to happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And even regulators in Washington state are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Supervisory Authority for Spirits.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve the purpose of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent to follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6 and thus also forms the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how the state's requirement of "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his employees in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for these offenses “from now on.”
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce city regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people are liable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences that were criminal offences at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are dubious even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer show up adults for possession of smaller quantities.
The district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state fostered a deep divide among local officials regarding the big green experiment to date.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in court for marijuana offences and acts locally as a spokesman for the national organization to reform marijuana laws.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can’t accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to step in to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban that is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are judged by what the community has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my dream to have a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once considered the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my move to Worscester College in the late eighties – where I had planned to study history – I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, it was said that I had left because I had a problem with comrades having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A. N. Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason – a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate rights students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equal protection that benefits gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They are demanding a seat on their college’s Equal Rights Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Students' Association at Oxford University, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and wearing a silver suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sin goats for introducing higher tuition fees."
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Students’ Association, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the Conservative Students' Association of Oxford, says she has seen a growing rejection of moderate rights students among JCR members.
“This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to give Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester-week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I experienced that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-painted spaces of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been caught up in what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty ugly.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students laughed.
There were tears in my eyes.
“I suggest that you take a few hours of French in your spare time – so if you’re not too busy with your social activities,” Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting in college alone at dinner when someone gently tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father, Margaret Thatcher, is coming, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and business, who had ironically attended the conservative Eton College, told me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They fight each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purge of disdain and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said small-mouthedly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends have always displayed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes became cloudy.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being bullied.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week in which another history tutor seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly shunned, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a “brainwashing” and called them “old fools.”
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my rabbits gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You'd be happy to call me a tearful cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic, it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses created by his "house" over the past 50 years have been put together.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stubborn and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be open until March 3, there will be a variety of private letters and photos signed by the finest aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t show off their cocks on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, he was recognized and felt his influence.
“All the guests felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” who began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long walkway, which proposes a roller exchange: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audience", which is worn by the masterpieces of Valentino, which is worn with Arús, such as the Kennedy dress.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "gilets" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg, who is the fashion leader, also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to that.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a neckline that honored his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her fashion designer's evening dresses "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress by Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
Troubled for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulated as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always admired his refinement, his tranquility, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace of him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano put their life and health at risk by carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the bouncy stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle’s pace, keeping their balance and carefully putting their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Arrived on top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresomely heavy baskets three kilometers up to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the occurrences in the volcano since 1960 and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of plywood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route", explains Anto, who normally makes three trips a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn from fieldwork.
"The daily wage of miners here, where coffee harvesters are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the bearer, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I converted her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left its first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a porter.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur also emits at night, where its characteristic yellow color glows blue in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur onto their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) extra per camera, which the guardians of this natural park together with the admission fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
“This work is for animals and not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old bearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners squeeze into the thick columns rising out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees, blisters are on the rise from the school.
With the basket on his back, Uninik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks across a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur-bearer with his 30 years.
Time passes, but poverty continues generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human burdens on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are blaming having no children on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an ad for mint candies, but still – or precisely because of that – they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The sets are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Shoving a bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the ad will come in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to breeding, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don’t we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But so far everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 – also known as replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marital and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people, in addition to marrying and forming a family, to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increased number of singles and to the delay of marriage and births, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counteract population declines has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where hardly cached xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started controlling the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they deter construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out in days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
As a result, they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were previously hampered if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they won’t have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for not being able to have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s so much the government can do.
Offline Private Offline is online private
Privacy (policy)
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you have the right to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t of me, or of someone who’s making the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of nudity, of crime, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone answers me, I’m just uploading them,” he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he said.
According to the boy, no one made any suggestions to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone is harassing me or demanding it from me, I’ll just remove them from my user account,” he admits.
Jose responded to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unaware of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend’s friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if he disliked me or I wanted to erase one of his.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, “because we require them to have a defined criterion about what is being disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for that.”
“They should also be selective when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo of you posted, like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission beforehand if you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is imperative that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, the age, or what you can share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the UNASUR Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was theoretically to be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Session of the heads of state and government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the cloister, but then explained that it would be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they said that the contents were presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
Journalists’ access to information on the summit was limited at any given time.
During the day, in the press room, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists were received from the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with the summit's "final declaration", but it was Humala's declaration and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American-Arab Summit (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite press urging, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems were available for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of The Hague that resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process of initiating the Lima v. Santiago, to listen to the pleaders of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently bringing before this international court," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful settlements to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, had filed an action against the Bogotá Agreement, agreeing to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since the removal of its president Fernando Lugo in 2011, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state reads the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over an investment amount of a total of $ 17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the UNSUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we are extending the decisions on the right of residence."
He said measures would be taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised, cross-country crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take triumphant features, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future,” added Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects that aim to improve spatial connectivity in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms,” the president said in a readout.
Among these projects were five Peruvians, which are located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve to re-establish it in the Union of South American Nations," he said.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting in Mexico on Saturday with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgement of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
“Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),” Santos said.
"We will review all of these pathways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency during the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn how to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America actually learning something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans killed themselves "in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which is being promoted by the member states of UNASUR.
"Free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign everything for the South Americans.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is headquartered in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said as a reference to the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he would not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had adhered to his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there were “reasonable assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his procedure would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been conducted via the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental condition would be impaired.
"Since he is in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a mild lung problem but not a serious one," he said.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a tight space and unable to perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to Assange’s asylum granted since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was the granting of a free letter allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe’s.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings on various European instances," he said.
And "if the UK grants this free letter tomorrow, it is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish law permits and in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to assert himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate are "the mediocrity, the evil intent, and the lies that undermine free expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he welcomed the fact that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and not even by the bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries", and anticipated that in a re-election he will "deepen the revolution to continue the path in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not carry out any opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua’s maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime law borders between the two countries, “absolutely justified.”
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also hoped for a good settlement of disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call on international instances if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it turns out to be very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will run as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach his third consecutive term, he said he "sees this opportunity with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 election, he would retire from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under circumstances as unfair as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to take that responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I would retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not in any way mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of AIDS Death is a Late Detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
“It was as if a bomb hit,” he says of the moment he received the diagnosis the doctor tried to “weaken” without any recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in whom the virus has already done harm and their immune system has exhausted, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who was quoted in this article as saying.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life from the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the beginning of treatment would depend on 50 years, and that those greater Z would not have depended on 50 years at the beginning of treatment.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who are diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25 can become 75 years old without problems in this sense, as long as they are under control.
In order to properly categorize this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has declined significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is still true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients have died in the national database.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, there were 187 deaths; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been assured since 2005.
So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people get into a far advanced state because they do not know their infectious state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to affect global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why massive screening tests must be offered to all people who are required to do so."
This proposal was approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, and this was for the only reason that he had already made a friend of his, who had been so confident in AIDS.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die, and they don’t want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, I’d rather explode three times,” they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my own health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the global AIDS day.
The sooner they know they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly, like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the designated locations, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased; previously they were given away individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need it for?" is a widespread mockery of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not be located just behind the shop table, but in outlets in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity,” he said.
Key details of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is nationally ranked 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur through intercourse, 6% through blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unfortunate precedent is created for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the acknowledgment of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bankarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas on June 15 results in Mexican companies being helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico’s largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, headquartered in New Orleans, initially says that the main case is the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a conciliator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy proceeding that the Vitro branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family filed an objection before the same Court of Appeal in order for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States, will be lodged.
The seriousness in this case is that the court set aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act is described, and in which it is pointed out to the State that it had come to speak strictly to the Council of Ministers of both countries.
It is also noted that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After several months of no-show by the Mexican aviation unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of a fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The petition filed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, alleging obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the Supervisory Authority systematically refused to inform the Central Administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the Trustee Account F/589 of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is encircled
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has not complied with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had ignored the possibility because it saw them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock market certificates of over 500 million pesos to the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose target is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world champion, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was a part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
“My whole life I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s,” recalled Reyes during a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I’ve enjoyed most because I’ve been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a CEO, co-CEO or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, “I have a very strong and 2m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we were fourth, which would have been Bronze if it had not been for this Canadian referee who had us repeating the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the United States a fight, as when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were back on the team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team because of a knee injury in 1990.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as substitutes for the blocked players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, play only in their area and only in the national playoffs meet teams from other corners of the island.
Today, children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I enjoy listening to music, watching videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most,” the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic CBS series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its vicinity aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The ad "Who Shot J.R.?", intended to create anticipation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at the time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had conceived her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) introduced.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as a “huge personality on and off the screen.”
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love Him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and volunteered in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are coming and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudarmageddon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which is actually supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and looked at how they could compare themselves to real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an attending Professor of Art History and Anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We’re not taking 2012 so we always keep the option of being able to hold the course again, in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent demise", students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is being conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night when the world is supposedly ending," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the semester began, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, in turn, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a matter of consolation or lack thereof.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the interviewed students – let alone a professor – said they believed in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“People elsewhere don’t think like that,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who is teaching this year in the Philippines, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a mercy from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of by the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
