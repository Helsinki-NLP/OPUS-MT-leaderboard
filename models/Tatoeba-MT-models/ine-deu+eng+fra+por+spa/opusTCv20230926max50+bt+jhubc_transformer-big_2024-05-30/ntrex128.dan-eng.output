Politicians in Wales fear “like fools”
There was consternation among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could lead to ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a brief verbal leap from the MWP to the Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill introducing the name changes, said: "The final decision on the designations that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in a public consultation.
AMs seemingly propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name constitutes a claim to Greece’s territory and has long protested Macedonia’s attempt to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will deny the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells keep silent while Harlem churches fight
"The older people I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are socializing in other ways nowadays,” he said.
"Bars no longer make up the neighborhood's living room, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised from selling assets won’t last long, and that “sooner or later they’ll be back where they started.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s recurring retreats.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it breathes further into the development where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been operating nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem that would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clock.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell ring "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played on the bell in June, called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were picked up by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council – the parish’s leading body, made up of leading laymen – wrote in July to the diocese about concerns that the diocese would “try to push the expenses further” to the parish council, even if the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on dive after lobster in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, as he approached the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It is unclear what species of shark was attacked.
Lifesaver Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to occupy the UK beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow as fashion and home products decline. The larger lines of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they turn out to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says they’re doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw introduced for the first time.
The existing assortments from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the range of Boutique makeup, so most products are suitable for vegans – something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily from local grocers means that supermarkets have to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early '00s, but the collaboration ended with a quarrel over how the profits from supermarket pharmacies would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold their 281-store chain to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the captivating environment and practical locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'shocked' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "raging", after TV host Holly Willoughby resigns from the deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious after she pulls out of their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “rageful” when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would have to deal with over the next few decades.
Her decision to resign surprised all those involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from the host of This Morning, one of the UK’s highest-earning stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as Chairman of the Board in March.
The couple are going on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will be the M&S brand ambassador, replacing Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business moves."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a parody of the news.
“I gave up nothing.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward nuclear denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding reaction" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament action.
He noted that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump took a more optimistic view of the speech at his election rally.
“North Korea is doing very well,” he said.
"There was an uprising to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – ending rocket tests, helping with the release of hostages and returning ground remains from the US military.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tightly packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroys Island and Kills Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population were homeless, no national state of emergency was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but a tsunami is apparently missing, and it has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with next year's election campaign.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalizes at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri less than 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I made a single touch. I didn't think about it much and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semi-finals, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker gave his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up on the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's half-track.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle.
He then made a long episode that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the farthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15 Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster preparedness said early Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the bricks of buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with bricks from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.

Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to step forward.
Police Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded anything with the dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A weeping woman arrives.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the lockdown and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the last memorial to be affected by the discussion on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The picture storm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his forefather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and remembrance.”
Chinese farmer attacked and killed by sniper
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overripe artery and greased in blood near a pig trail on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next to him was open.
He said there was a big eagle in the pig path with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who goes by the surname “Wu,” in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarities, but there have been previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kilogram Welsh farmer masted a pig against his tractor, until his wife frightened the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They are just doctors.
They nipples, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rainfall in large parts of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rainfall with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States, with a low-pressure outlet over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the US West Coast.
Pink will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low-pressure outlet, creating heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of up to 51 to 76 mm per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into bubbling rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust blasts.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains relatively warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.
There could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a high likelihood of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million eyewitness accounts on Thursday from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations interrupting the regular programs to tell about Friday's late developments: a deal made up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunken state groaned at her and tried to take off her clothes for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional statement that he is 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewer numbers from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewer number that corresponds to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose influential hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
He looked down for several minutes while he was being scolded, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, saying before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour on the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are under-represented in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspicious of LSU Player Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of negligent homicide, police in Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the match.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to the Wayde shooting.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-cm-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spies ash over Mexico City
Ash spit from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater occurred and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumbling and shaking over several rounds.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters seeking independence clashed with unarmed ladies as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back unarmed girls, threw down and powder paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day when police used their spells to keep the fights down.
For hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met by unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The atmosphere remains tense in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt the voting during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night before to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for having the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they won a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either themselves moved into exile or are in detention, awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote independently and the subsequent.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the setbacks in democratic values and the subversion we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, an armrest was fired at the car.
Shot from Menga gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The uprising overwhelmed the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager for the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won the league off-field this season and is set to face the leading Hearts team, after which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will receive a visit from Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outlay
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal after sliding in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-header in front of the goal.
The home team were content to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the outfield problems in deadball situations.
And it was under these circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson co-created the play for Menge, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was fired with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadball situations.
There were continuous passes into Livingston's field, but were prevented, and two claims for penalty kicks – after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad have remained largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since joining.
There were many heroes.
Chief Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they got the home team stripped – and it’s a steep awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but crowds of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also made themselves known and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been rebuilt, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured during riots
Six prison officers have been injured during riots in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There were riots in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, and the riots are still going on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, unmanned ladies were summoned to prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with insulated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Floods are a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.<0x3C>/seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore decreases in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical currents on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can become severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“A total of 76 to 152 mm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 254 mm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening floods and liquid precipitation in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Murder Attempt
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Officers have urged anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was subject to the Democratic Party's "evil and anger"
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and monstrous tactics,” Trump said at a polling station in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to the “evil, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote on confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in the public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polling stations at the midterm elections.
"Five weeks from now is one of the most important choices in our lives.
You can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to “confront and block.”
The first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, a senior Republican told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many were swept away by huge waves hitting the beach when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high hit the coast at twilight, sucking many into death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not immediately run and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster preparedness, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it towed cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
More survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness team has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal town continued to be shaken by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board of Appraisal and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found clamped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometer-long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticised on Saturday on many fronts for failing to disclose that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsunami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but there is still a strong need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the yard by their account. They came past areas of extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They said they saw so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organizations began the hard work of resuming relief work, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and workers from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can open up for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held on in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that illuminate the dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one grey flybe instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling ATM in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was meeting an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported preferring the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between uppercase and lowercase letters and changed whether or not to include the hyphen.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double the Financing of Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have made statements on artificial intelligence, but the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double the budget could double the chances of achieving the next major achievement in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain grants from the government, Lee says.
“It’s not China that’s taking the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China’s next-generation artificial intelligence development plan was launched in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation delivers funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the founding of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, U.S. legislation attempting to set up a national security commission for artificial intelligence has stood still for months.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has applied for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electorate will make up the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and assert it.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the Macedonian vote on a change in the name of the country, which would open up membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with our forehead raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "securing of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote – less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the proletarian government since it entered office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a pass on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before slamming into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to overtake Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal in that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League match.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before he led Sterling towards the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward dotted the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drill Rockies
The Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the always-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the cast on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the opportunity to participate in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title in store.
“Even if we don’t have anything to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at probably the highest level I’m going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play under these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds an election in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans appearing in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That’s why I travel around and fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means available, and you can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "to oppose and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and vicious and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the Supreme Democratic Senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered a loud arc from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a big party.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome – only because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For the majority of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the Friday evening meetings have been exactly like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not that, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" politics is far back in the past, if ever it started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are weighed on whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political stance began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – a long streak of rude messages follow on social media, calling for the rejection and contradiction of the middle-minded policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are usually political.
I have a deep respect for the professionalism and the willingness to fight of those colleagues who are overwhelmed every day with sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve gotten a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I’m not so loud, then I’ll “get it right.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decay, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a city councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country bounces towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the only message I have is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of rejection or political suitability will deter me from acting on what I believe is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have gotten the final result to draw a not entirely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in Tennent’s Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense as well as their better use of chance that brought the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely right to be satisfied.
"Our matches have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish national player Rory Hughes, awarded for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the midfielder. He scored and then got a solo score, so there was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on a stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the front with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr leader Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the forthcoming Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more almost immediately after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent batsman Gregor Henry off to homefield's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step into the catering industry after it emerged that he has taken the post of director of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character along with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the Navy headquarters, encased in rains, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it's a right.
It is our duty to take it back.”
Throughout the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, and so is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
Hopes may be at their highest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will agree with Bolivia that Chile, after decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the verdict on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s side – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, based in the Netherlands, has no power to override Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice pronounces its verdict just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have been a setback.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has eliminated the remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and achieve benefits for both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons unless they can first rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His remarks came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a resumption of nuclear diplomacy three months after meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it is a “dream of desire” that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare until Pyongyang has taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear, which you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the veil on the catwalk for a collection of extra large headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most impressive work was a sumptuous one with a feather-like wide shade that covered the models’ heads.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled a snorkel and mask scuba gear, and others resembled a molten waffle.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're lucky.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide shade seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media has sent a new big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that displays it.
The orange bass bag with bass fringe and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such a huge influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in giant size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it continues in 2018 with yet another number of outstanding exam results, which are reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other endeavors in the local community.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can compile and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it strikes the heart.”
It’s an important reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year, that language is the highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject selection at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools of thought and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies were related to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in terms of preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career young people choose, if they have learned a different language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
Speaking multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game before the start of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It’s not clear how many minutes he’s playing.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans against the Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t need to fight before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is beginning a string of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first out of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s appointed judge for the vacant Supreme Court seat has been suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans face the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) between Saturday, November 29, and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were strained due to allegations of sexually abusive behavior, and the expected Senate vote on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary goal of this strip of voter meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five election meetings next week are aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we are entering the busy campaign time,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be cited by name, told Reuters.
Tonight’s poll is held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to team up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who is involved in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and tries to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles duels
After three one-sided innings, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it as a bit of a momentum," Spieth said before holding the four.
Of course, Europe has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play over.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel they have a bit of wind in the sails and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast of three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important punch that secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His cushion that secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
“You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own struggle,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but sympathetic pairs have scored four points in four games and seem flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy apparently flows on both to and from the wild audience show that they are the ones that will be the hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is fixed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
synchronously in each of their holes.
However, it is too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning of the four-man duels, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four-ball, two-team and two-player games are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates lead 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the US of 10-6.
Well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, trying to win the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. provided more resistance in the foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood" together, are after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had small brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it completely, as they want it, on a slightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being four points behind the singles, but since Furyks currently holds the cup, they only need to score a draw to keep it.
After being second-best for two days, however, it seems they can’t master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would heighten its mistrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had shown “significant benevolence” within the past year, for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, winding down an area for nuclear testing, and vowing not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take the first steps ourselves and unilaterally disarm."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as has been the case otherwise previously from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim vowed to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked in.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s missiles at the US mainland was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump at the UN threatened to “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions had to remain until North Korea pulled down.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for these actions, but said "it doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to halt Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, while North Korea just hours later accused him of making "conventional demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to shut down a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as movements toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses to Get Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where one studies all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has done the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“When the presentation was over, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do I only know this now that I’m on the candidate?’
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health department, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants learn about how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive campus map.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an “allnighter” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think you’re hungry, which is why you’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the damaging effects of light from electronic monitors, which can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menger lower Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the field as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take on a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox were out after their first victory on the field since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts in first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
The Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, while Livingston is climbing to third place after Hibernian with only the goal scored to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, scored with the same 11 that shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents across the pitch.
The Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes inside the game when Menga's first-ever episode sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was over.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the back pole.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was dissatisfied when Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless broke up after a 15-minute game.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shots.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was a bit of a coincidence, it must be said to be worth their effort alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga who could easily kick it in the goal.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave way when the winger sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outside team to play on their premises with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the final part of the fight, but McGregor rebuffed Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being knocked out with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way here.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become an integral part of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as peasant scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals does.”
Evans: "Stop it, now it's going on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “makes several cancers develop,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancers, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was bowed down when he paid tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president himself in 2020.
After playing the evening's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved out of the United States,” he said.
The SNL began the show tonight with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to expose West by uploading the footage.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage because of his headdress.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there wearing that hat.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sinking deep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I'm sinking?", saying that he would put on his Superman cloak because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience buhed at least twice by his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported with a comment from a person who was present: "There were bombings in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LATCHING YOU FROM THE PUBLIC."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is just as he is, and that's fine."
But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his “art”) who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we have too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extends after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero, saying that such TV characters mean that young men often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believes something has "gone wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much".
“Currently, I have a lot in mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate, and what is taught?
What do young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel like they have to be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be part of a re-recording of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family’s Scottish estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men sooner or later marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many infections are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
House Speaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations came from websites and support from the "extreme right."
“Lies, lies and more terrible lies,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information allegedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as the Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You must not become defiant.
The motives of the prosecution must not be questioned.
You have to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In an official statement, Waters said her staff had contacted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations.”
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British flair, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English – born again.
Will daring, sarcastic self-satisfied, about how greedy it is with us, become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and big eyes has been allowed to make roarers again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention aimed at places where cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the clumsy secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and properly clapped by him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international jersey that left chaos in its wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the stem from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels pretty underwhelming and strangely redundant, especially now that more "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also feature comic comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
The endlessly current point of departure for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready prime minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there’s not much to work on in the script.
As her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is forced to cancel someone’s pension.
And, of course, it's the messy Johnny English, who's now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-fought former right hand Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine is wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Agency's most eager Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is stumbling close to being imbued with the charismatic and scary tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their furious risky escapes: disguised as servants, they set fire to a prestigious French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard the Volta’s luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta’s house.
All the guns are fired in the film's final sequence, but as well-meaning and energetic as it is, there is a sense of children's television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help thinking with the other Johnny English movies: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to give birth with a plan for a four-day working week with unchanged wages for the British
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is said to be considering a radical plan so that the British can settle for a four-day workweek, but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that the employees would have three days weekend without going down the payroll.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party’s economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
“It won’t happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workers and the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, this objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour’s shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week’s party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to strip power from “anonymous directors” and “exploiters” in utilities.
The shadow finance minister’s plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders in water companies will get their money back, as a Labour-led government could “counter” them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have workers on corporate boards and to create inclusive equity funds, which will allocate 10 percent of the equity value of private companies to employees who are about to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell 60 Minutes If FBI Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Voice
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I went into the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be carved in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and anything else would require a very harsh accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see how that would change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness about the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Started in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, doing volunteer work, writing to a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really change, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” – that is, that people feel that they are making a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter post?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “acts” from its members targeting various targets.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and policy actions equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, amounting to over $10 billion that had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which is a collaboration between investors and actionable individuals. They aim to “help children reach their full potential” and promise $35 million to address nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told audiences at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutritional advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be hosts.
U.S. can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says U.S. Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they are in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability with our fleet to ensure that there is free passage on the seas, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that considers itself the “voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration aims to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokesmen, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion costly Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal competitive conditions and is simply due to economic considerations.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the BDI, has called on the United States to intervene outside the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'considers strongly' to run for presidential election in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is "heavyly considering" running for president after midterm elections, she said on Saturday.
At a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering stepping up.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in the front,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will be considering running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, the FBI has to investigate the case before the vote.”
However, a poll from Thursday shows that most of Warren’s own back country does not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not appoint.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick with 38% in favor and 48% against a possible uprising.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he is announcing his final decision in January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin Names Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s Elections
The 26-year-old Track Palin was in Iraq for a year after enlisting in the army in September.
On Monday, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he comes home allows me to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience at a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reporting domestic violence and possessing a weapon in a drunken state, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for Wasillas police.
18 states and D.C. support resistance to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-independent statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers are descended, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Aliens Committee in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against the principle," the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy as they are more likely to become self-employed and “bring the necessary workforce.”
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions’ immigration judges revoked the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stance," Sessions said in his decree of the law on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We are lacking clean water.”
The residents now returned to their ruined homes to sort into soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, lay outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was crushed against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of False Methods and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper slamming the benefits of a U.S.-Chinese cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid inclusion in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in November 6 congressional elections. China rejects the accusation.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, former U.S. ambassador to China for a number of years, governor of Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China “increases the use of the false methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has set the emotion ablaze, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
“This cannot be done over,” Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in the 11th hour will mildly anger voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted during a demonstration in the Senate: “November is coming!” as the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to reach new heights," independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters — 18-29 years old — who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee’s sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could be a setback if Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become a worse mess for Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – points to the news channel.
But Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimonies from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh was either likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
“At Flake’s request, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other,” Deborah Ramirez told The Guardian.
Last week, under oath, Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh drunkenly abused her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to make a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend’s project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can make their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether they need to change everything completely so that all of their business models suddenly become superfluous."
"We're not asking for your permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Recipient of the Victorian Cross from the First World War is celebrated
The only English church priest to win the Victorian Cross in World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Priest Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two grandchildren was revealed at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy firing from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people with the "greatest manly courage" before attacking an artillery rifle alone and undocumenting three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also made a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."

Imagine you’ve been up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and then be denied the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this very fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“By law, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yeah."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English viewers in future planning.
“When we think about rebroadcasting, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning over there, and we won’t find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was the legislation.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We just sat down with five matches instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less valued than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got into the larger classes that "everyone isn't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less upset in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the long-running radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first show and said he felt "less worthwhile" than anyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, the feelings of being worth remembering and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT advocate and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would all be about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept him to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London in 2012 – as he would sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first became clear to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead.”
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unscharp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to do something about the form if it is not to become a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who set a record for the 12th time in the competition, which takes place every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events in the United States as usual, the five-time big winger had to act cheerful and practice his game in the hope of correcting the flaws.
Even not at the peak of his career, he had the most straightforward drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalizes loser shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t big enough, Mickelson will face the always precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari at Sunday’s ninth match, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles matches start strong, Mickelson’s fight could be decisive.
Furyk expressed no surprise confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a slap on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I figured he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes to something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to sneak up on people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just the game.”
Europe's Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Knows Big Lead Can Quickly Disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cup singles can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just getting caught up before the finish line with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had a good lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just exactly won," says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 on Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it’s not over.
It'll be full of garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Delighted with his players' performance on a difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual achievements that count, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re being tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he will also get the best out of himself.”
It looks different to opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced turnarounds on the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline, before losing, when Europe did the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We’re putting our team on the line and putting the players on the field in the order we feel we’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the retreat and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans must wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media write.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but post-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered back in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a minor maintenance need: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship useless in combat situations.
Software failure was of particular importance, as the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that’s only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability for future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs dry for deployment-ready ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to join the fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret lives of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, elongated bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the bat activities throughout the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analyses of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the fleas and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation interventions such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they hunt primarily at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly away from obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect shipyards and sometimes do rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated tiger reserve at the Threave area in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s tiger species.
The caretaker of the area, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of looking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, thereby risking the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him “fake news” and says people “will promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called “an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for “moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the report filed in the city court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "the one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent for it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court deal because she felt "banged for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now says she will reverse the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was due to take place, and this summer switched to the Italian grand club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily cut production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said longer waiting times at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March," Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke said.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are expressing fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with risks to the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without an agreement.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day’s production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "co-ordinated so as to precisely avoid these border inspections."
“We need to have a deal. We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy justice minister Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of court proceedings.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and there was a rumour that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was arranged Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein. But the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like to always keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without citing a source: "We have looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to give this ample opportunity, and you’ve seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it’s going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with senior guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in Scottish healthcare after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are continuing, and decisions appear to be expected in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care work for the benefit of patients and the community.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie Gets Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was operated on after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State First Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell around there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie’s operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details on the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he incurred the injury.
Abercrombie is studying for the second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles overall this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying homes in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, should help the homeless.
This move should dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will affect those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May is proposing that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest income.
The increase in stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The profits from this should be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added in addition to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-house purchases and purchases for rent, can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, causing prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use, and he asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed a striking range of housing reforms, including controlling rental prices and depriving the landlord of the ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the ability to build public housing.
May said: “Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be as easy for foreign companies and individuals living outside the UK to buy homes as for hard-working British people.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s coach”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from North East, which now holds third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and it has always drawn me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I succeed in coaching clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach said he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
“From the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly home to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’m sure I’ll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa come back after moving down in the third-best rank and transformed St Mirren from the declining threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real roadway," he recalls about the time in Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served wisely and had some successful experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven’t been more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life.”

The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5.30 p.m., study shows
The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant at CGA who has collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the June pattern, with pubs experiencing 2.8% more sales, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on the sale of beverages were clearly doing their best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food were in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, beverage sales increased by 6.6% per month, while food declined by 3.3%.
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to selling on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a fall in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt in addition to rising costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a much-needed respite.”
The overall increase in total sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, showing the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and they are leaders in the field.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children – up to the age of 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren in grades 4-9 reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being uploaded
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents
One in five children up to the age of 11 create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from 4th grade onwards reveals violent growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a “master account” that they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those making decisions about sport to benefit from her vast 10-year experience at the international level.
“Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will be able to benefit from having her on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help outline a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and who is now a frequent commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get over it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am perfectly healthy, have learned to walk again and are doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what’s said to be the “world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired commercial to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a chorus filled with hay to a song in which it says, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this is not upper, it's my breasts."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my breast."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.”

Another wrote: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a brilliant product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers pumping milk (often at their workplace or on the toilets) and feeling like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bra.
The concept behind the ad is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Secretly Moved to Texas Border Tent Camp
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, even though the number of border crossings has not changed. This is partly due to tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The risk of being sent home increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress, telling them that they had arrested several people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had pure criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to chase those people,” Albenz said.
In an attempt to deal with the children’s cases more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, before it was within 60 days, aid workers say.
Many use video calls instead of appearing and speaking their case to an immigration judge for legal stay.
Those convicted of being ineligible for stay will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, according to aid workers and reports released by the system in recent months.
People who advocate better relationships say these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where its size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the ability to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem addressed the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is “almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we cleared all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unjustified fears" that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They're politicizing what was supposed to be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces was avoided against the province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions will go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, an outpost of al-Qaeda that "will be wiped out."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has placed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation in the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020 unless the Reichsgericht and scandals end his presidential term prematurely, which many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic ending of a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the best broadcast time has nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings with great news.
“It’s a spectacle that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” Neal Baer, who leads the ABC drama Designated Survivor, said of a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet, it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you see a six-hour panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s ostrich jacket for $15,000 (“clothed with hybris,” The Washington Post wrote) and the implications of Trump’s coverage.
I’ll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises.
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, ‘It’s the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find their way to the close midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money, as a result of a settlement of two "Congressional Districts" two members of Congress are fighting for the same seat.
This newly remodeled suburban district of Pittsburg is causing problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting member of Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps strongly with the new 17.
The cards were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has begun a struggle for financial means between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support to China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump’s management team.
State Department officials decided to call back top U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about $140 million from the US in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thereby dropping considerations of punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal about the importance that Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough demands or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to discuss internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could very well be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller also said he will focus his investigation on whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress comes into new hands, Trump will likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet again with the electorate and, in time, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I’m not saying that Trump’s eventuality is inevitable – and the same goes for his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodshed afterwards.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history revolves, and the irreversible march of democracy increases or decreases.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein’s seat has been hot since the current newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden footage of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times' statement is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the FBI’s recently enquired investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly conducted – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have a good chance to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the belief that we could bring something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the last season behind us and have success.”
Fear of retirement savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing anything to start the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in time.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed through traditional long-term care insurance, cash-out life insurance or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the funds to do so.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get a power of attorney so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure doctors and nurses comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic power of attorney.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details in writing, so you're ready.
“It’s not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"Which medicine?
Who takes care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a city tour.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "completely coincidental."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death toll to rise.
As the communication routes are out of order, relief workers have been unable to receive information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and lies at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was once again hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called Pacific Rim and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and to resist arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female confessor as she attempted to report the alleged crime.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail without security, reports KTUU.
He was tried on Saturday, declaring himself "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which could lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which could lead to a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending at the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the reporting of a domestic violent crime and the possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication roads, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutors Try to Get Terrorist Suspect in NYC Sentenced to Rare Death Penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market in October to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who crossed the road were tossed down.
As a basis for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the Declaration of Intentions for the Death Penalty in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov for a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of gang-related murder, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparations," the accusations said, describing Saipov's execution as "monstruous, malicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last raised a defendant in a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up in prison for life in September 2009.
In 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to legal documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was well with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to 22 paragraphs of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that he was "of course disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the accusations not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister believes NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers said Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have been “out now” if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to unite the deeply divided party is underscored by the fact that conservative remainders are participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attacks from both Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos”.
For the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we'd be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough minister added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected that the public's attitude should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and would like to remain in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also attended the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the general population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the streets and getting us elected.
Now, drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a pointed remark to May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You have to make sure that the political class that is about to betray Brexit can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, remainders marched through Birmingham before a two-hour parade in the city centre.
Scattered activists waved with Conservative Against Brexit banners after the group’s formation this weekend.
Before the meeting, Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security issues with the Conservatives' party app.
"These are the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, to the border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's ridiculous.
There is nothing called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren 'considers strongly' to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the House of Representatives, is "strongly considering running for president" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a city council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, is set to seek re-election in November against the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in the front.”
Arrest in LSU's Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU, was arrested on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday at an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to having been present, in possession of a weapon, and to having shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter-tall third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season, he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes, making 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the driver's position Bottas got a good start and was close to dismissing Hamilton completely as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit first and let Hamilton fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton again came forward when the Ferrari driver, after some wheel contact, had to reluctantly leave the infield after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first half on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for a large part of the race, failing to change tyres in a quick attempt to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pit in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace in the last eight innings, which is why Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job of securing us both first and second place,” said Hamilton.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a poll on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an election rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last couple of days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document – “oh, uh, what?
No, no, no, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
Have we leaked... No, we have not leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations and I have not leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at Saturday’s poll: “I’m telling you it was really bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president’s continued defense of the nominated Supreme Court judge, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to benefit their own case.
“They do not waste any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the viciousness, the abominations, they don’t care who they have to drum up to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made it back after Friday's lost Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly advanced with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants ahead.
Francois Bouchard offset Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory by two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefes team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where the Giants went out as victors in the previous three games.
Dwyer set out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again equalized with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday hit Sulawesi island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed back in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was staying on the runway, got safely into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are broken,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to get to them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flown in with emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
All the stores have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re coming to.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to locate the man.
The airline has not returned requests for more information about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low waters.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could walk into the water for life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working on renovating a nearby dock also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to haul people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts establish timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on Saturday during the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to summarize the course of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers’ cell phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat at the witness stand on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lies because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple after firing with 'racist' text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a text message from a mother who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied that they were racist, but compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she appeared on her first working day in 2016.
“NOW, NOW, NOT A BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former nanny, who is from African-American, had been poor at her job, and that instead she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day job and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the firing, as well as compensation for $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to live with the family, even if this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she told the newspaper Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racist and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone you’d been rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your baby? Your baby?
To be honest."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really go after someone like that?
It's not very kindly done," the investment advisor added.
Although the trial is still underway, the People’s Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It’s pretty fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothespin, would have been optimistic even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't mind bragging," she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who accomplished something: you’re proud of them, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington’s fault.”
Saying goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she was going to die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you again soon.
I'll see you then.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body closed down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get along.”
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears continued to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Saddened Women Try to Stop Suicide Scammers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I’m going through every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
His smile was known to everyone.
People said that his smile illuminated the room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he was really ill.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Sharon Davis once said, “I’m always afraid that it will spread.”
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's ripped us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear as FBI begins investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a time-limited investigation of a limited scope - we might get a little bit of agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall from behind" amid the locked-down partisan situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans, as expected, are doing poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to elect to the country’s highest judgeship.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known if Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea's merger ministry and said there were 1,127 sacks last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border adjoining North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the fugitives as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to return.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This comes after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm on our own," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate for the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court judge, "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh dismissed the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his high school years, he almost cried and was crying.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and a coordinated character courage” organized by the left, angered that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I would say that if he’s not speaking truthfully to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer any questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
“It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person has to contest a job as a judge and expect us to say ‘yes, it’s not just nice,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger coming over, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's abnormal, do you?"
She continued: “I got a lot of support from a woman who was boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a majority of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was caught by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little scared of – and pulled out on the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry, and they’ll accept that they beat you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could as well run as the presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of electors, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She's crying"?
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and even though the battle is far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy probably won’t give up for now.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they give in, but for China’s President Xi Jinping it would be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less interdependent.
“A swift decision in either Washington or Beijing can create groundwork for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to accept refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says the country is ready for the refugees to return and asks for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now present for the refugees to be able to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
An additional six million people who are still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on pair 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singlematch on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a joke statistic for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding their way all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I am proud of the boys, for they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counterattack.
We lost.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten the hat.
We were defeated.”
Algae blossom update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

According to the FWC, widespread blooms are reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The bloom of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are less blooms about 16 km from the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Flowerings have also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported in or at sea in County Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations in the sea off Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or at sea off Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte.
Breathing difficulties continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of breathing difficulties in northwest Florida in the past week.
