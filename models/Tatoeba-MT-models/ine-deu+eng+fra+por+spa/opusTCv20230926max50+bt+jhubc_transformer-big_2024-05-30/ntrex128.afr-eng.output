Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned they will "look like fools"
There is consternation among some meeting members over the proposal that they should change their title from AM'e to MWP (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that this could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Meetings Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Meetings Members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that received wide support to name the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AMs are apparently in the process of proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to come forward with a bill on the changes within weeks.
Legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the workings of the meeting, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the drafting of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to clear a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia, from the way.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly rebuffed its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gyorge Ivanov, who opposes the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells go silent because churches in Harlem are dumb
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to say, there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"None of them is there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways," he said.
"Crowee is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from asset sales won't last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore will bring even closer the day that these churches completely close, because most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white municipalities before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A Black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's lay leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the municipality's governing body, which consists of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some members of the church complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Thirteen-year-old Shark Injured at Crab Dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, injuring him on the first day of the lobster season in California for lobster, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rushed with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's screaming, 'I'm bitten!'
I've been stabbed!"
His entire cleft was torn open," Hammel said as he walked out to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy flew to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species was responsible for the attack.
Lifesaver captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his buttock.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are struggling with department store-type beauty walks run by specialist assistant crew.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger beauty walks in 11 stores across the country will be tested and, if successful, taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets look for ways to fill racks that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more young buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Online shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily from local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the Aldi and Lidl stores.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since buying both of these chains two years ago, which, according to them, has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how the profits from the pharmacies within its stores should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially-trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a territorial beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "furiously" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from her on a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their housewear-and-accessory brand name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The 37-year-old This Morning provider announced on Instagram that she is withdrawing from her job.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she couldn't spend enough time on their home-and-nearance,trueness-trade.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she is leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's top priority by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her completely defeated all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow Headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's biggest money-flowing stars, could chase the firm millions out of pocket due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility that its launch could face even more delays.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
It's hard to say "we fall in love"
He mocked criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his Kamma-"news reader's voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament are on fire.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, more than three months after the June summit in Singapore, told leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North did not see a "consistent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at sustaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic turn in his convention speech.
"We are making good progress with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending firing tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have almost 200 people standing there," Trump said as he pointed at the crowd right in front of him.
A tidal wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population is rooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung told me.
Although Save the Children is in the process of forming a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia is constantly suffering, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, albeit a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's intertwined infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko's administration is being pissed off by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of slowing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs have fought in the streets with rifles, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri signed for Sturridge when he was 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He touched the ball to the left before kicking far to the goalpost.
The effort sailed high above the frame as it floated to the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball hovered over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goaltender played in that play area with a back-up again to Mateo Kovacic before scoring near the midfield and nailing in Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly received and surrendered in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then introduced Hazard into the window.
Hazard crossed the defense and with a left-footed kick passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker into the longest goal net.
Liverpool will face Napoli at 3 p.m. in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play for Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami hits 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It is reported that many people were trapped under the rubbish of buildings that caused the quake, which hit a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, to collapse and cause burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was sown with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed in a Grayson Mews in John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything ominous to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's survivors.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
It was heard that a police officer for one man said that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 a.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call <0x40>MerPolCC DM, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Cromwell Statute Becomes Latest Memorial Hit With 'Rewriting of History' Dispute
His banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sweetness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statutes that Oliver Cromwell's figure would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The imagery of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still commemorative.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murdered Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his from, "Yuan," was found dead with a blood-covered torn artery near a box at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring hog.
He said there was a large male goat in the box with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeded and torn," the nephew, who was named after her, "Wu," said, citing the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the marking authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although odd, cases of pigs that attack humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig hung a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was fed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're just playful.
They're pissed off, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.a., a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 p.m. on Sunday, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific is beginning to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in response to the approaching drought will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous kitsch floods, waste streams, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause site-to-site rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most parts of Arizona.
Kitsch floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to venture on foot into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep-grown desert rivers to touch and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth runways.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rainstorms will begin in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains will become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October may see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warming in October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of upper-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are watching Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks on Thursday the compelling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-go turn: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was beating her up in drunkenness and trying to pull off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday afterwards, Nielsen reported.
The company averaged viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as large as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was always high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught Friday morning on CNN and CBS where protesters yelled at him as he tried to take an elevator to a Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while CNN vividly depicting how he was being slapped.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and walked in front of the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all later covered live hours when the Judiciary Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look at the allegations against the candidate for next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "absolutely ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the struggle.
Police recovered the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS-affiliated WAFB reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he admitted he had shot and killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish's coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University police, and local citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanks territorial law enforcement for its "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "flattering" and "shocked" at Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wayde said.
Volcano splashes as in Mexico City
As what spits out of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after picking up activity in the crater and recording 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunderstorms and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin low-gas motor windshields near Mexico City such as Xochimilco covered.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing voice for demolition.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police covered them with eggs and dust dyes that caused dark dust clouds in streets usually crowded by tourists.
A stutter also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their batons to keep the fighting in check.
For several hours, pro-independence groups on one note sang "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionist's scream of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the marches, the local press reported.
The tension is still high in the independence-sensitive region a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but the turnout was low, with those against deposition largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes attempted to prevent the votes from continuing at the polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet nail-biting victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled this year to retain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in advance for their role in organising the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after motorcycle hits home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly trapped against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some stage after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Advance Livigston stunned Rangers to move Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved along with Hibernian to second place.
Gerrard's team remained unchallenged in the Premiership this season and will face the forerunners Heart next week, which they are eight points ahead.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is expanding their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still failing to taste a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to have run ahead long before they scored a goal, with their round-heartedness pulling Rangers all sorts of problems on their necks.
SR broke through, but dribbled in front of the goalkeeper, then AL could only play wide after he approached and met CH's header across the goalkeeper.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could catch the visitors with deadly moments.
And so came the final goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely carefree.
That pattern continued in the second half as Alfredo Morelos forced a reversal from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow tapped wide to evade open play from Livingston.
Crossings have repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly twisted, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – have been ruled out.
‘Phenomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward path.
Their playing style and crew have been nearly unchanged since their return to first rank, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his masquerading defensive line-up while Menge kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
The Rangers have been inspiring.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they couldn't maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they find in the middle division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a briefing on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then allowed Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque but numerous supporters have appeared to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also made their voices louder and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The belligerent protests reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as a hero and is portrayed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford crash: cyclist dies in collision with motorcycle
A cyclist died in a collision in London in which a car was involved.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and notify his survivors.
Road closures and bus reroutes are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialists - "Tornado Guards" have been called to deal with the uprising, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
The staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison's principal had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called upon to pay attention to serious disorders during which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kits Floods (Drought Areas May Take Advantage)
It's uncommon for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and carries kitsch flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued kit flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching late with rain by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside kits flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore its power is decreasing.
It is therefore expected that she will reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storm forces in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and involve a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening kitsch floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage sons of a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cellphone footage of what happened to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered among the community, the rage" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered among the community, the rage" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday and fiercely and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for these candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader's assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away when huge waves broke off on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a party on the beach when burners of up to six meters (18 feet) high broke at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their deaths and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, bumps, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to jump the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was swept away.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake garden.
Communication "is completely hampered by no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not communicating that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars along.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image eg.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-Tsunami death toll rises to 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city where workers sheltered in shelters erected in their office's inner courtyard, they passed by scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups begin the awful task of starting the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign relief workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and staff from overseas can only be launched after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can set it up for international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the onset of the second evening on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paratroopers team, has dismissed two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the fake screen weave community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thief steals $26,750 during refill of OTM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "runned from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West to change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the program that was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the program's producer said.
Apart from the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also managed to cope with or without a matching sign and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to never use military force against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to punish the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements were postponed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities draw the youth to gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even briefly the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the odds that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player, and later he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help boost U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence that aims to engage partners from the industry and academia, and the House of Commons announced the formation of an Audit Committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire months ago.
Macedonians vote in election or country's name needs to be changed
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor's name represents a requirement in the area and has refused admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjörge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the rise would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of incapacity by 1 pm.
But the rise was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small elevation and moved chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" answer would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A backlash in the referendum will be the first serious backlash for a pro-Western government's policy since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through the entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took the Brighton defense off the road in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian goalkeeper received a touchdown at the beginning of the series at the midfield.
He chased through between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero is surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed at one defender before crossing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal range.
He then pushed a pin to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the loft to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
"We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the far end.
The Sky Blues' forerunner kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the backline.
City will take Hoffenheim in the Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker wants to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, which have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one promotional seat with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but still want to fix their first division title.
"Although we don't play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th, had a throwing practice on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I’m fighting for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And now they are determined to take back power by using any possible means, one sees the commonality, the aversion.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run about to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and vile and false."
He referred to the name of the Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who had received hard boons from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leave the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
Workers' Party is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerable to those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Labour Party LPs to be told we’re not welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because she has courageously stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues on which Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "more friendly, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, expected me to start making a U-turn and taking positions I would never otherwise agree with – either on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there follows a tyranny of skepticism on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core and telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more embarrassed.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I would then be "okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a teacher 32 years ago, driven by the Thatcher government’s neglect of literally dropping out of my state high school, I’ve tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused at all about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending for a Brexit that is damaging all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether their members are Labour Party members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political advantage will keep me from doing what I believe in all of you.
Chris Leslie is an LP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The conqueror's father
Two late three may have skewed the final result slightly, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard, the only unbeaten team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, targeted by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an undead.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he, just before rest time, set a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, scored by Baggot, reduced the back to five points.
There was a long pause for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott which was dropped on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, targeted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for killing Climo without the ball, and from the penalty stand, MacPherson shoved the ball deadly behind the incoming Ayr locust.
Climo meant it, as he also almost did it from the start, after Kyle Rowe scored David Armstrong's goal and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to take on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star appears to be moving to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wants to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': land-locked Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a mass-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are plastered with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Across the land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – because of the need to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on big screens across the country, hoping the court in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has many that depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that little will change if it does.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes just six months after the last rally shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's case, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has squandered any remaining Chilean kindness, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold close-up talks.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extraordinarily swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will "bring an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless the U.S. can be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. captivity to a declaration ending the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about distancing itself from an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to ensure their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian fashion shows unveil latest series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely dislike the sun, you don't need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of oversized headcovers to their SS19 collection on the runway that enchanted the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats swept through Instagram this summer and these designers paraded their stunning creations on the runway.
The highlighter by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter as haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and scuba goggles included, while another looked like a molten ice cream shaker.
And if you continue the big show, it's your lucky day.
Stylists predict that the huge hat may be on its way to the stores near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide rim seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over social has sent another big creation across the walkway – a straw-beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-wearing model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffle case, finished with raffle shavings and finished with a white leather handle on the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer - as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized extras."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zipper of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which have only been reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 schoolchildren across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schoolchildren and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that world language continues to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolchildren who studied foreign languages achieved a grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as subjects, have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill positions are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in today's children's language learning.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment,that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
We have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening game.
The exact number of minutes he's going to play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has announced that he will hold an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled moves in the coming week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held back for his choice to fill the vacancies in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when there is a vote in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how does one look after it online?
Trump's reunion in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia via live stream below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation deadline being withheld for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main point of this overcrowding is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said these five moves in the coming week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management of Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who denied being named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, which is arranged for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, it will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they have the courage to fight to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game teams of Saturday afternoon were probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is an entirely elaborate sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum, I guess," Spieth said as he ran away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more that are played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from top to bottom and led by his example.
That scoring celebration cries became harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical stance to win game four completely equal while he and Thomas were behind after two rounds with two.
She said that the match won at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells a person that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players are doing now.
18 puppies to print their stamps.
The only players who have scored more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uncouple but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not record one on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy apparently flows to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be beaten Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari that can sound a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It's either at the same time or with different puppies.
It's still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made shorts with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps on track and two doubles on the front nine made the Spaniard and the Swede end up in a hole from which they could hardly even come.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-player teams are so exciting to keep an eye on because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the US team has the courage for the battle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming up with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to sleep at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to keep the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, has overtaken an American team that has performed unequally in the morning's four-balls, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the four games and won two games, but did not let them shrink the back.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played excellent together to defeat a pap Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always make sense on a pleasant day with a windy southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won a major tournament three times, and Justin Thomas set the score for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing their first two punches.
Only twice in Ryder's history, a team recovered from a four-point back when they entered the singles game, although Furyk's team only had to play equal to retain the trophy because they already held it.
However, after being second best for two days, it doesn't seem that they will manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not "definitely" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated its suspicion of the United States and that the country would certainly not relinquish its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolence measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to take nuclear weapons and nuclear technology further.
"We don't see any similar reaction from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will definitely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear weapons removal according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not unilaterally remove nuclear weapons unconditionally.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump ordered below.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted requests to ease strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our suspicion."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump at which the U.S. leader drew attention earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party on this issue was South Korea and not the United States, the destruction of nuclear weapons would not be achieved."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different than last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's missiles would be aimed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump had a "shooter" for Kim on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim overwhelmingly for his courage to take steps to disarm, but he said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain there until North Korea defuses nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without interruption until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dried up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of making "benign demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile site and also strike a nuclear complex if the United States takes "coherent measures."
He said Kim told him that the "coherent measures" he wants to see are security safeguards that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on Enough Rush
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine-driven "whole-night sessions."
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often inconceivable when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this only now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to enter the course after it was found that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep tydroetin.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes is," Czeisler said.
The culture of pride to study 'whole-night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough good quality sleep, a student should be a 'secret weapon' to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, making you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the damaging effect of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and lead you to suck.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menge defeat Gerrard's men
The Rangers experienced another sarsy day away heartbreak when Dolly Menga's goaltender Steven Gerrard's unsympathetic team took a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only awarded Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so his team was eight points behind Hearts, who ran loosely ahead in the Premier Ladbrokes.
Menga struck seven minutes ahead of schedule, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers are now falling to sixth position, Livingston is climbing to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final match of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team crushed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score points after just two minutes when Menga's first run passed Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big shot.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss at the rear goalpost.
Rangers took control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to get a penalty goal at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly beaten by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft goal from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
The Rangers didn't even have to deal with a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menge for a simple roundup.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his stripe to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to deflect Jacobs before Lithgow could enter wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TELL MORE... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Dude, it's about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer enzyme can teach the immune system to "see" predator cells
New cancer enzyme can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predators
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify predatory cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predator cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is present in many cancers and is called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump spotter after his appearance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was announced in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a lengthy performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would make him eligible in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he issued a statement against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's footage was clipped by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock for West tried to make fun of it by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the stage about what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've ruined me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear her "supermantle, because it means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comment provoked at least twice an outburst in the audience and members of the SNL role division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "The whole studio was dead silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Roman talker Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West is backed by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE SKARE."
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts and proclaims an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
"We too," she added.
Before the show, the spammer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the entity that used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-Space chatterer Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course, wildly music-loving Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Land Tax Court on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-waving role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles often mean young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture, saying he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "relatively strong" about making this issue work.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up regarding the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is most likely responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something went wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday issued allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and still disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the postings is linked to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security was compromised as a result of this deceptive and false allegation - was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is utterly untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement promptly provoked online criticism, including from former Withuis press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"It indicates that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't want to be challenging.
He doesn't question the prosecution's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to get Waters out of the cushions in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said her office "has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive allegations."
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructible and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - blur Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit significance in any new film with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy mockery franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfied about the topic of how obvious power we are to be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the awkward Johnny English with his outlaws and rubber face has renewed his license to waste everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English speaking filmmakers.
He is, of course, the ridiculed secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretense of sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot of that old man who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire themalid at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, leaving chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two lovely moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who approached a helicopter while dressed in a medieval armored garment and snapped the screw blades briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels rather blurry and oddly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy itself with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's adversity isn't as original and focused as Atkinson's quirky jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perpetual thematic assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-cracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent at his service - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and besieged character, already experiencing a total collapse of political unwillingness: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been put in danger, she must summon someone from her retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some decent institution, but who from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-maptic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely spill everything into Her Majesty's secret service and they come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous escapes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English lets pure anarchy break loose when he tries to use a headset for virtual reality to get acquainted with the fullest.
Nothing is saved for that last scene, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like children's TV.
It's fairly mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to justice?
Labour denies that it has come up with a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers' Party must consider a drastic plan that would cause Britte to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party claims that corporate base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them an extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same pay home.
Sources say it will "pass" the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in favour of workers.
Changing after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this ambition is currently not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A Four-Day Work Week is not party politics and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "fake directors" and "profiteers" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back as a Labour government can make "deductions" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent equity in private sector companies to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, "Have you done this?
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the World Citizens' Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars performing and an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens' Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by not only Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket after the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call targets, or any other meaningful way to deliberately distort them.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a great way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "activism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Weltbürger says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and vowing to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they got more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd in April 2018 during a concert in London.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
"It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will be successful because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use fleet for "blockades" to curb exports of Russian energy - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on its fleet to prevent Russian energy from landing on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees themselves as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The ruling comes as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of their liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoners."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view provoked a backlash from Germany, reaffirming their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the midterm elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest sport," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren voiced her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont's senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with a case of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers are returning," she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing deep-seated problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will definitely be made on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such attorney-at-law violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court legal order said.
Attorneys further argued in the lawsuit that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nypending.
"It feels very tense," 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, bring an ambulance.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes, searching through soaked possessions, trying to rescue anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital where patients were treated outside due to constant severe post-shocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I've been pushed into the ruins of the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "harassment" with "propaganda advertisement"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China Beijing accused the U.S. press of being used to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid entry in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s state newspaper with the most sales — after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election noted what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff rounds being equalized on each other's imports.
China's retaliation efforts early in the trade war aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a statement in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing very limited deviant voices and will not see any true reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shrugged off the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters for midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warns analysts
While many top Republicans at the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are standing up and defending himself in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are very high, and most Republicans are on record that they are already indicating that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill, said in an article published Saturday.
Instead, he said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s advocacy for an FBI investigation would be enough to lure angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters throng "November is on the way!" as they protested in the Senate entrance portal while the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Mi Blasey Ford, said in a statement.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among swing-voting female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony stating the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue with the affirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh will be put on trial, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 say they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh likely or definitively gagged during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's allegation, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches a startup business that seeks to partner with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, do-lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing an overall change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Kol. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest courage" before storming a man-only rifle and knocking out three of the section.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's performance was "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youths.
Michael Vann said he felt "felt encouraged to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a bunch of people."
MMA fans stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night watching the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the fight, viewers in the UK were stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after they stayed awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke."
"This is government regulation that the content at 6 pm was not suitable and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about re-broadcasting, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of texts sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We’ll limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to offer more to our fans and just went over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a 'minor' feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school until he realized that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular provider of the year-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling differently, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's State Federation Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has let go of his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “captured him unconsciously.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says her "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I've dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of my home crowd at an Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first songwriting – Pride by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson won't go to the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to regain his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing for a record 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and quarterbacks.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being a race leader and working on the practice field at his game in the hope of fixing what skeleton.
Even at the height of his career he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long rough always punishes the wandering hooves.
And as if the race on its own wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match Sunday, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles matches well, Mickelson's match could be absolutely essential.
He trusted his father, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams last week and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I've put more into perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 habits, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed untold aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day's singles game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail crap with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scratch," Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching how the Class of 2018 washed off at Le National before Friday's 5-3 win.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be happy tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I still say all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Delighted with how his players got on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a mate when things are going well, but when you're individually there, you're being tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will want his players to sail better individually than they did as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself had already turned on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every divisive word of it," he said in response to a question asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had spoken courageously to his players on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We've set up our team accordingly and we've categorized the men we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and coming into the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new warship postponed
The German army's newest frigate would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the head of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the agonizing post-delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels commissioned by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battalion of air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home harbours.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships – which will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate made storage last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also came to light that the ship is drastically overweight, which reduces the performance and reduces the Fleet's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also become an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that have bitten the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Fleet's "ships that can be deployed are on the move."
The official said the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been put out of service, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano-dwarf bats as well as the brown longhorn and daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand indicators.
Expert customer analysis of all surveys will check the frequency of the bat groups and determine what species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat for the bats are most important and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture breeding and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep spots and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The squirrel is not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ego orientation technique to point out goggas and obstacles on their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and sleep check-ups and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the need to seek out bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that the unknowing destruction of a single stall could mean the death of up to 400 females and youngsters and could wipe out an entire local population.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill, disrupt or prevent them or destroy their sleep spots.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are sailing."
Ronaldo ends rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, published hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, ended the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" who was left behind by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement outside the court because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved to the Italian giant, Juve, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK will "repent forever" if its car manufacturers lose
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "worrisome" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily have to stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said it would shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say supply chain risks are in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "only time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and spare parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Clark said May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us to enjoy not only the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convener on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred by another week" as the fight over nominees for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible violation of the law by the president.
Whether or not Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies the report.
But last Monday he went to the House, amid reports that he was on his way to say thanks.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see it being postponed for another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a Withuis press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions isn't due to an antagonism for TV journalists who are "effect hunting," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect hunting."
She has admitted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a personal information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and occasionally bizarre appearance in front of journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show the country's gratitude and express the desire that they will remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I value each staff member's contributions, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service's work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before rest time.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
He died five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total standings for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher sealing taxes when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher sealing taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher sealing taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to work against homelessness.
The additional tax – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent – could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens who are pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in sealing taxes to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Ms. May to waive quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of anticipated housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-error" dismissals.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness a too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the tops.
He moved to the Stadium of Lig this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I took the second team, but that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But as a child, I often watched with my dad for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that draws me back.
This can only happen if I'm successful in the game."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he doesn't feel afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, after previously dismissing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross's career in management is only three years away, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says as he recalls how he took over Alloa's leashes.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person needs to do every week.
I'm still going through it with regards to the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found survey
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' revenues, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking venues and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but restaurant receipts fell by 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even weighed in.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking places and bars fared better and rose more than restaurants dropped.
Food-led drinks have also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed bars and drinking venues, sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, with food wash off by three percent."
Paul Newman, of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly difficult above and beyond constant cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking venues and restaurants, including new venues that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand announcements.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers, reveals a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo site.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they have a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who landed on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site has found a teenage girl who encourages others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Governing Body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from its far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, unable to walk after having a short-lived ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but has fully recovered, again learned how to walk and do agility exercises today!
"Thank you for the message of encouragement!"
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the launch of what's called the world's "first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-the-body music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to mothers who are milking.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not urine, it's my breasts."
The choir section says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding the babies, pumping it out, pumping it out, milking my ladies."
But the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed feedback from viewers, with many saying it underestimated the "ugly" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Before we have to conceive and give birth to them in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another said: "It's very traumatic for mom and dad.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for moms who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screamy" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have had one if I'd kept feeding.
It made me feel like a cow's milk.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I've accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at moms who are out milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their braces.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many lactating women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is still, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nutritional bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out as they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining way that people can connect with the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvis's story has been told.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border agencies have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fierce rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration making it harder to place children at sponsorships.
Traditionally, most bailiffs were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be endangered by taking action to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to bail out unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either bailiffs or family members of bailiffs are illegal here in the country and a large chunk of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we continue to prosecute those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are considered inappropriate for emergency relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling to be more easily overlooked due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign powers are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being rooted, is "almost over."
He said Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away."
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel fortification created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals likely hope, a state of accusation and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what is undoubtedly "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major newsnights.
"This is a fire people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can unite and the health of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 truss-fly jacket, "should have stolen the clothes of Trump."
I don't think I'll ever watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he's feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, head of industry at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily twists in the plot (such as looking for quarrels with N.F.
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh being on his way to appear before the Senate's Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out now they were right."

Out-of-pocket flow after the most exciting mid-term election races in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw an influx of money, thanks to a move from congressional districts that now put two office bearers in a race to the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district leaves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measuring forces.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delimited in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial bones, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail crab victory in a widely-watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a bit of an advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but retreated.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners dismissed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," the department's spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent the United States from migrating to the US.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear they wanted Congress to continue effectively ending any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now destined to address Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new nasty messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible overthrow of the court, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr Trump's campaign with Russia cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
Should Congress pass in other hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
It’s a bunch of aces, and with that I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, when the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the ruthless course of democracy is being accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now facing several such turning points in the face.
What would we do if Mr. Trump's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation, dismissed?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take the president in secret and speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we keep track of those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table wearing the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a waypoint for bigger things.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and stepped away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a tie count is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there's a good feeling factor at the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully, we can get ahead of ourselves and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Retirement Savings Fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for providing care if you don't express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Edit your legal documents: Cut off legal battles at the passport.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you appoint a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you can't communicate.
You'll also need to consider authorization for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with wind bucks
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he stepped home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, emergency response officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, leading to a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
It did not lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed due to buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence, and opposes arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he picked up a woman's phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured deposit, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring "innocent, definitely" when asked what he advocated, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment not yet executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan to cut off pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these defendants are liable to the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury defeated Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of extortion-related murder, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and perverted."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted of a plot to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were rebuilt with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the allegations.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a shoulder recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the "people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the heat" away from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own LPs proposed he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-banker Peter Bone said for the March in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces to unite her deeply divided officers has been highlighted by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies have insisted that she will press the door in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite the death toll – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr Bone said for the Loop Mean Loop convention in Solihull that he "wanted to throw out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in control, we would have been out by that time,” he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers."
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone dismissed proposals that have changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure that we are elected in the first place.
"Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farge said the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We don’t want you to get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in downtown.
A few activists cheered Tories against Brexit bans after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peasant Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application like the conference opened.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology in place for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“This is a very clever one.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard' to become president
U.S. Envoy Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that she may be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump came to power.
She asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played in 32 games with 10 advances last season and he maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive far behind in the bundle into traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes made a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver facing risk-free insiders at risk of endurance after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear of the road jump grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he clung to his tyres to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the 44th round at the wells, but could not speed up his pass in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic things all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an exceptional job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
It's been a very bad language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a convention Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing her Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed people to be "ruthless and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that went into the Senate over the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you ready?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't have that much."
Well, wait a minute.
We leaked it...No, we didn't leak it," he added, in a statement from the senator.
Feinstein was sent back the letter that set out the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not like her denial and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I tell you what. It was quite bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
"You see the wickedness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to turn around to get power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars reconciled Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard scored Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their victory.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then won 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull help, with David Rutherford fielding the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first break in when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again got their equaliser with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen lead Dundee late in the second half for the first time in the game and he made sure to win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane could escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many have been trapped in demolition in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his position in the control tower that swept heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on runway at that time, was able to safely board.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he day it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're heartbroken to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster response agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still under construction while many can't be reached yet," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters rushed Palu who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-marks are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hunting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says now one man is missing after beach lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says one man was missing after they earlier said all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane entered very low.
"It's a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendant panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said creatures working closely to improve a wharf also helped with a rescue inflatable boat to land people before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have already died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analyst sets timeline apart from evening when woman is burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night of his death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from different phones that showed Tellis and Chambers were together on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "joking, because my move was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers deleted messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is it a black person?!
New York's daughter sues a couple for being fired after "racist" text
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an ill-addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "just a black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the case to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, eased her dismay when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"There is not a black person," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to me twice.
After noticing her mistake, a "unpleasant" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice, saying that their outgoing nanny who was African-American was doing a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
She was paid for her work one day and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks her compensation up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, residential work for which she was initially appointed, even though it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing such good," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple backed off on claims that they were racist, saying it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and fearing they wouldn't be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
You're a newborn baby?
Let's go."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion" and said his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you just one person?"
It's not a very good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very exciting that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been fiery if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't an apple-grained man," she said.
But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success kind of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was pretty bad, that they didn't expect her to do it," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got Nad's call saying she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say hello.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was dead for a while and the body was about to close.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to put it together."
Eventually, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who at that time was hurt by the loss of her daughter, went on the plane with the other passengers on board - unaware of the trial she appreciated.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shook my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelmingly sympathetic feeling for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Saddened women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting maps for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile made a clear departure."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said her death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It breaks a hole through the family.
This divides us.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that didn't have a setup - we might be able to bring a little unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan accumulation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to set up an FBI investigation?
All of this is due to their timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans go badly, then they will be very weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the House of Commons and who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a ballot box in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s ‘Down’ Numbers Under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 overflows last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights take place via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Highly Protected Demilitarized Zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the invaders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the strike negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday slammed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerias," says he is incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "histerias" and said he was temperamentally incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the commentary in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'histerias'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Law Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times he almost screamed and stuttered while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly disapproved of Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "ridden and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's currently on," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommegang Appellate Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger overwhelming, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she talked to, 'You think I'm dal.
I am angry."
And then she just walked in.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for tom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest recollections of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless rage and being grabbed at my neck by an older woman - a cold driver I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a reportage.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think about it well," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would give only $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry for sexism - that she had strangled.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate guarantor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The opening avenues of the U.S.-China trade war have been overwhelming and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial in the long run for Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by charging key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation kicked in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in goods and recently slashed tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 trillion in US goods.
China has promised to equate the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy will not move anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means surrendering to requests, but meeting U.S. requests in public will be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on U.S. trade war over the long term can positively support China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can kick-start an economic turf flight in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the middle of New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation at the ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he emphasized that it will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have secured the invasion.
Europe seals Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team picked up the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, made his T-hold in the water at par-3 16th hole and conceded his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all his rounds and has become one of the 1-in-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European all-time winner with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so thankful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I've grown up and looked at that old man," Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the cleanliness all weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we had a bit of heat on Europe.
We've scrapped it.
Keep an eye out for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
