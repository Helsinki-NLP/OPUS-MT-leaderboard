Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to drive her VW from Merklingen to the left on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim around 21.30.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist who was coming from Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to evade the car, but still strayed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stripping process, the hand and foot brake lever were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
In spirit, he drove his motorcycle into the green strips next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker Suffers Leg Injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury on the lap and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mammy: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a massive coronavirus infection on a large vegetable garden in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the operation.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau County Council Office on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population," Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU) said.
Seven employees had already been infected in the plant before - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers are only for inserted glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with well 3,300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
Infected people were separated from uninfected workers on the farm, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"It can be a bitter revenge if such local infectious events are to be ruled out and regional lockdowns are to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary director.
The SPD sees this very similarly: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“The hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions need to be strictly controlled from our point of view.
This obviously didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came "with announcement".
Subway station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the trackbed after pusher
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a thruster and slipped into the trackbed.
Obersendling - On Friday, at the Aidenbachstraße subway station at about 4.15 pm, there was a dispute between two youth groups.
A passer-by alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Municher (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the side of the platform and fell into the railing bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the crashed climb out of the track.
The danger of an incoming train did not exist.
According to the police, there were again clashes between the two men.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personalities could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
The storage of data is currently suspended.
However, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the retention period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a swift change to the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quoted from the letter.
The storage of the data is currently suspended.
A decision of the European Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report goes on to say.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would only make sense to check whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already expressed his support for a storage of data.
NBA: Strip club wrestler for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, Los Angeles Clippers basketball pro, is reported to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he was still visiting the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in isolation, being tested daily for Covid-19.
Its reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for these wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered Williams to be quarantined for 10 days.
So the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test match.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play at the end of the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Söder speaks out about the Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) on Sunday announced a test sweep for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened authorities and politicians.
The large vegetable farm currently employs nearly 500 harvesters from several countries, more than a third have been infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food will be delivered.
To the more than 3,300 residents of the municipality, the authorities now offer free Corona tests.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the County Council Office assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the yard.
"Break of conscience": Confessions of the alleged Nantes firefighter
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "stricken by bites of conscience and greatly affected by the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the man threatens ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire last Saturday night.
The fire broke out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations strengthened the suspicion of fire.
The suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly caught the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," Grindel said in a statement.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous for Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one does not get around the debate about whether it is not mandatory to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts about whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an even distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,” said the 58-year-old.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and passed through the press rather than appealing to me," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It has been very humane for me.”
He had received the gift worth around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11,000 from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I dealt with it completely transparent and discreetly.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a heel out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead Person

Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes challenge Corona
Despite the lack of great sausage in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug burn, many came at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Sylvie Thormann, the curator.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant Atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting with her husband for more than 25 years at the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historic flanking and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual program highlights, especially the halls burn on Friday evening as well as the historic festival and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"This is a pity.
The weather would have been great this year,” she said.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the festivities in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa cafe.
This year she was walking in costume in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
“It’s more stressful, otherwise we’ll have it easier,” she says.
The riding association had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quartet will be able to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will be held again.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second-league club Fuenlabrada
Spanish second-league footballer CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into the crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid despite the first Corona cases on July 20 had flown to a game in the city of A Coruña, a low hit follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, with one coming to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League is threatened.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper AS wrote.
Pictures show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
"It's neither good nor good enough," he wrote.
The club management, however, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, denied the allegation of intentionally endangering public health.
There has been no violation of the Corona rules set up by the football association, said the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Prior to the departure, there were four infected people until July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were retested.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members were positive for the Corona test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must catch horses that have been torn off steam
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user reported two free-running horses on the feeder between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the horses were able to gain the trust of the officers shortly before steaming, they each had a rope carried with them in the wagon.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
FRANKFURT/MAIN - Seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team on the framework conditions, how and in what form it could proceed," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Previously, he had woken up after a fall, and the first thought had been, "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: What if?
The cyclist admitted that there are aspects that he is increasingly struggling with.
"But it was good for me to remember, based on the Corona time, what I have about cycling and how much fun it makes me".
The time travel specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (August 5-9).

Kovac Tests with Monaco vs Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac will soon meet Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be visiting the former club of the Croatians, Hessen, on 1 August at 6 p.m.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hardest test before the Europa League rematch against FC Basel (August 6th).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
This is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Prior to his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had taken the succession of the Croatian at the conclave.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the semi-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0-3.

700 dead from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
As a result of heavy monsoon rains, a total of 700 people died.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Tank horns in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank horns died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the tides are particularly bad, which is why scientists have blamed climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New homes are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
There is also enthusiasm in Grenez.
Those who used to have a house, even though it was so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but they will soon be taken by those who have lost their home due to the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Argentina therefore calls on its private creditors to waive part of its claims of around $66 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentinian history.
Recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and amendments to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, is sticking to its latest offer and is not willing to make any further concessions.
Argentina is facing a serious economic and financial crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic strength of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest claims of $503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the job, the normal day-to-day business has long been on full tours.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler indicator and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, has not been enough to completely relocate the food hub from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she and her husband, who serves as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for parental leave for a short period of time in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Grown up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been a term for her for a long time.
During visits to the village with her family in the past months, she found again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was even more pleased that she had made the race for the vacancy in the selection process.
Her home country, Lower Bavaria, also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career: after studying law in Passau, she completed her term as a referee and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "alongside" the doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she moved to Regensburg, where she was a parent.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden had been tendered due to the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for full professional reinstatement, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has immediately a compliment for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food hub.
With regard to kindergarten and crèche places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Because of the distance regulation, which must be compulsory, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund manager Carsten Cramer told the "Day Mirror".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB lost about four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator places, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
Given the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side-length first".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work."
Little miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 premature babies that are taken care of annually at the Graz Children’s Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few — like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael — are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini diapers for them.
But not so small that they would not be at the voice - "and how," Berndt Urlesberger whispered.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loudly as big babies".
When the Whiteboard Becomes a Stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grade of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the City of Aalen presented to the students the production "The Home Dress" - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to share the play and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lesson.
Even if in the end all the participants agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, the theater also sees the potential for contact with the schools.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the gameplay,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would hit Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet in Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the lottery on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are fixed.
The lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD-Sportsschau.
Because the participant field is not yet complete due to the Corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renouncement of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If a second-league entrant from Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already qualify for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to beat Regionalligist Aschaffenburg in the final game.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September, a week before the start of the third league.
Olivia de Havilland's film legend is dead
Oscar-winning actress Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 from a natural death, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German news agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the 1939 South American epic "Wind of the Wind".
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian playwright Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Shakespeare's Hermia "Summer Night's Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio signed them for seven years and brought them out big with Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, William Wyler's "The Heiress" was nominated for Best Actress.
Much recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dunkle Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied für eine Leiche".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) came the son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at comeback
The second World Cup winners Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they beat their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Flügen with 1: 2 in the semi-finals (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
The last time Thole/Wickler played was last September at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flügen defeated surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde by 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting points for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a “fig leaf” and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,” FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
“If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists from their party consistently, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago,” Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume commented: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks volumes rather how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has".
Blume expects the AfD to return to below 5% in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the now officially dissolved "wing" around Thuringian AfD-Lands and group leader Björn Höcke; the protection of the constitution classifies the strangulation as a "secured right-wing extremist endeavor".
In May, the AfD federal board had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now-banned far-right "Homeland-Friendly German Youth" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburg Landtag, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuvering of the Mouthen Troop is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the protection of the Constitution and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
“The AfD won’t let go of the ghosts it called.
An eviction does not change anything there yet", commented Brandenburg SPD secretary-general Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Länderverband and the faction up to this day held their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now proceed in civil law against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms supply 21% more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind turbines on the German North Sea supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid.
This is well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind farms on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid, have supplied a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas is thus at 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy comes in addition to the wind conditions from higher generation capacities, because in the last twelve months new wind farms have gone to the grid.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this, according to Tennet, at 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections until then,” said Tim Meyerjürgens, CEO of Tennet.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms can not exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2 when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
Nearly seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blasted the usual frame after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery was the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
Windbergfest is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We certainly did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - we hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (Parteilos).
"But in the end, we are responsible here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands of people had flowed to the ground and into the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been observed in accordance with the current Corona Protection Ordinance.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much of a folk festival would have been left.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by several times.
Rumberg resigned next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxon Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider in the dressage tournament in Austria Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four starts over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihgold and Quantaz at the start, she was also in the Grand Prix Special and in the race on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old Stute Weihgold, Werth scored clearly against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday in the special.
On Saturday, the German was clearly on Quantaz ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressmaker in the world is set to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first choice at all.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Worms University of Applied Sciences continues in the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the start of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are equally used both at the university and at the DFS Aviation Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and staffing of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences are in the program Air Traffic Management.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, economic support is not easy for us.
However, we firmly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our statutory mandate, we need highly qualified staff,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Executive Board of DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, technically cross-cutting knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, also underlines this: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her we would like to join the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Aviation Administration is both a motivation and a commitment for the University of Worms to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
In its work for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students with the first Foundation professorship for a dual study programme.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on A 45
Around 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford at around 12:40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte straight in the corner and landed on the dashboard.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor facial injuries and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the ambulance and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no risk of death.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2,000 euros, had to be towed off.
Heil wants to test other industries for the meat industry
The Corona crisis once again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Exacerbations of the law are soon to come.
But are they right – and will they stay right?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the strict regulations currently planned against malpractice in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer employ foreign personnel for slaughtering, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of factory contractors and hired workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the DPA: “Finger away from a general restriction on labor contracts and employee transfer if you do not want to completely choke the economy.”
Work contracts, for example, for large areas of the crafts, construction industry and plant construction are the basis for their added value to the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a very normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and lending work unconstitutional only in its industry.
It is not possible to explain why in the future, when serving and packing cheese, different labour law should apply to sausages, according to an opinion on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
With a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram per product.
Many Eastern European employees from factory contract companies worked in the industry according to the results of an audit of the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn’t have a break.
Salary was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these have been circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now it needs to be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "The Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher test rates on labour protection or clear criteria for community housing."
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding workers’ rights in the meat industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I wish we could do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transports," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight plane in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultra-light aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel circuit office said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the opera house at night on Sunday was also peaceful.
More recently, several dozen people stayed on the spot, but left him before the lockdown began at 1:00 a.m.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and there was a larger police force throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, a ban on access to the opera house, on which a week ago there had been crawls, was in force.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrants.
At least five officers were injured, according to police, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night before Saturday was also quiet.
Car crashes: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Humme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 13:25.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on her way to her home on Bundesstraße 83, when her car left the road for a previously unexplained reason and overturned several times.
In order to save the injured, the firefighters had to clear the roof of the car.
As it was unclear if anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was scanned from the ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squad from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the troops did not find anyone among the high corn plants.
The seriously injured was taken to the Kasseler Klinikum for further care by means of the ambulance.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Humme and Schöneberg were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record-breaking champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer perfected the 36th scudetto of club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1:0 ahead of half time.
With 83 points, Turin, who entered without the recently injured former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer displaced from number one two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan's second table is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free kick variant with the last action.
One example of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This ensured the glamorous but decisive success.
The foul meter thrown at the latte in the 89th minute probably only Ronaldo himself was right in terms of the goal-hunter rating.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," coach Maurizio Sarri said after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Lastly, Juve’s calming edge at the top of the table was also due to the weakness of its competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will be king of the snipers is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has already 34 hits on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-tier Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but must compete against Olympique Lyon on August 7 to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all threats of penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to give gas to countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: In the last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparable values for the previous years, the rasers are increasingly doing the work of the judicial authorities: in the prosecutor’s offices between Konstanz and Mannheim in 2018 a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the Interior Ministry’s response to a request from the Landtags-SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously attacked each other or they fled the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked to cash: according to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years and indicated more often, a ministry spokesman said.
Razors are particularly popular on the 8th motorway, where motorists repeatedly brake off traffic to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "Rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, it is attempted to brake the mower on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The most expensive and muddy sports and luxury carcasses often have Swiss badges, because drivers evade to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 hours-kilometers, we would get this problem off the ground on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport experts of the SPD Landtagsfraktion.
"The barrier threshold for raser would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be on the road here and there legally with 200 hours-kilometers and more."
Rivoir believes less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Whoever, in such a way, sets himself above all rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at stake, is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
This, on the other hand, is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-touring force scale to become painful and serious: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people have died at the races nationwide, two of them unaccompanied in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men took part in a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people were injured in the races over the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor racing harder is not seen," according to the paper of the Interior Ministry.
July 23rd Blue Light: Thirsty Thief Steals Drinks From Snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at about 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who served himself drinks at the refrigerator and then left the snack by a previously knocked on front door.
The perpetrator fled to the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
Further testimony is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to win the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has won his second day’s victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer from Team Bora-hansgrohe set out on the 109-kilometre stretch with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the seasons three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger made it to the overall standings.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly opted for mountain time driving in the morning and thus took the lead in the rankings.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time drive.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters ahead of the goal, he just pulled on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly too."
According to the rules of the UCI World Federation, a Corona test was performed on all participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
Directorate gave instructions for lay reanimation
Dusseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Dusseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived just before 1 p.m.
"A command post dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," a firefighter spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescuers took over the resuscitation measures shortly afterwards.
The life-threatening child was transported to the uniclinic under resuscitation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely opened the investigations into the accident.
The firefighter said: "We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people took part in a Saturday night "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to tighten control over such events.
A major tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in the city of Nuremberg.
Hundreds of vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Frankish Police, around 10:30 p.m., the Nuremberg Transport Police found an increased vehicle traffic in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
Thereafter, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks.
Only recently the police had announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials included more than 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, according to the police.
Of these, however, only a small proportion of those present are to be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it is assumed that these were predominantly visible.
In addition, the majority of the attendees adhered to the applicable infection protection provisions, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site checks were completed by 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials noted structural changes in 10 vehicles in such a way that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the events and continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the arrival of spectators," it said.
News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved towing company: "They have all the beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company should be careful not to cause any damage.
"Young people should finally get their cars back undamaged".
Labour agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-term work abuse
The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-worker money.
"This is extremely low in the case of more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the board responsible for the operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-term employment, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the exam takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there will be some more.
We are not na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse would often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the fall.
“Will there be more insolvencies than last year?
The assessments are different, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in the labor agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neues Garten.
The gathering was dissolved at 20.48 by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The youngsters then left the park.
On Saturday night, some youths would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by area drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are always gatherings where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Procedure Regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neues Garten.
Even without a Corona ordinance, the parks will be closed at night.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, however, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but even at least one holiday guest has been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lockdown was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests have also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections were made public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several premises and could have contracted there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focuses of the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: United and Chelsea qualify for the Champions League
London (dpa) - England's record-breaking champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third place in the table by a 2:0 (0:0) victory against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as a fourth for the King's class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United led by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71th minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the finish line.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final opponent of FC Bayern, won in parallel with 2–0 (2–0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea’s victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided to make the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth on their own, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately equalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which kicked off three coaches in the season, will drop after five years in the Premier League.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, which has been an English champion since the end of June, secured a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team hardly missed the scoring record in English football.
The best score keeps Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses will also be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature termination or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Eventually, however, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
At night, there were violent clashes.
Israeli police in Jerusalem on Sunday night violently attacked participants in a demonstration against right-wing government leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police, among other things, deployed water projectors to dissolve the rally.
A total of about 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s office on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters blew drums, blew horns, and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu have also been arrested, the news site Ynet reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of sprinkling pepper spray from a driving car on protesters on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being held back by premature loosenings and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has severely affected the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate last year was more than 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to ever-new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter Kraft auf Auto - nine Injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 in Ahlen left nine people slightly injured.
A driver was travelling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police: "Probably she braked suddenly because she wanted to turn off."
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who was driving behind her, probably too late.
He pushed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the transporter were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea Rulings Off Border Town After Corona Suspect Case
North Korea has so far seen a “luminous success” in its own measures to defend against the coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Due to a first official coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely locked down a major city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, “the malignant virus could have been brought into the country,” state media reported.
A state of emergency was imposed on the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership issued the highest alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the scanned country.
North Korea had so far reported no single infection and described its defenses as a “brilliant success.”
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reported to have been detected by an outlaw who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The man fled to South Korea three years ago and has now crossed the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still-minded military buffer zone.
South Korean military, however, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, recognized the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea on Saturday called an emergency meeting of the political office of the Workers' Party chaired by Kim Jong Un over the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others."
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, were placed under quarantine.
Accordingly, the party's central military commission is to investigate the "outbreak" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
An estimated 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still on the verge of a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the development plan for the large project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost", says more casually in the central part of the city's press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is, however, controversial until the end.
Majorities for this are scarce, last but not least in individual committees, depending on attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, commerce and IT), the project developed from the citizenship and then by the administration and the municipal council now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unbelievable", "speculation", "false-sightedness" and "false-sightedness".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall is contrary to the statements of the city administration after grants, the existence of which Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than predicted in the town hall and by the proponents of the economy.
Designing the city by its own strength and not an investor: that was his plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, proposed an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the openness of the Schlossberg, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative spaces and a smaller inner-city redevelopment, ideally with local support.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the City Council will vote on the Noise Action Plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many time reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must be the case because they have to neglect the regular bus service with diluted speeds and, therefore, have little commitment to the car and bicycle traffic.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession of the state of Baden-Württemberg to the climate pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban children’s day care facilities and the application for admission to the federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they must take into account Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars could take up regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season,” Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently in the curves.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his first 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and was able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I have a dazzling understanding of each other and we have made tremendous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session as well."
That’s where the GT Masters will also run its first race at the Lausitzring.
Starting July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
But Zimmermann, who is one of the 15 seriellen eunuchs, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passes that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams do a little bit of poker during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will hit the GT wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spain vacationers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are just on holiday on the due date, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria until now, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbott said.
"But apparently no one took the trouble to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict exit lockdown, infection rates in the country are rising again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the new spread of nightlife.
Spain is one of Britain’s favorite holiday countries.
Unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland is currently advised by the British government, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Navy Day in his country the equipment of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said Sunday at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket zircon built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropdeo is still being built
It will also be built on the atomically fittable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces begin the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Department of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help made more difficult due to Corona
WASHINGTON - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains have now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Authority NOAA said on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called for a state of emergency for many districts.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas is making it harder for the workers to work, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees urged to be cautious
“Any hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott told the Houston Chronicle.
Regarding the storm in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated by the fact that it sweeps through an area that is the state's most severely affected area by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott urged people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stays away.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, they will be tested on Corona in emergency accommodations.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Retrieved
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was reportedly hit on Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior and headed to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on its way to Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the forecast, it will be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Above the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-averagely active hurricane season this year, following a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, compared to an under-average one even at only ten percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in touch with the affected states.
Four goals conceded: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic have been disqualified for two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals conceded: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a black-and-white evening at SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A football league at 0:2 (0:1) - and was really angry at the referee's video assistant.
"A festival not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
The host of Naples was led by a goal from the defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered for the draw.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - the VAR intercepted again.
Attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61th) also scored the referee team’s goals.
In the playoffs, Allan perfected the 2–0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for double-winner FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who has recovered "somewhat well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to consider how to rebuild his successful defense after the first team training after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, has the third-most minutes of play, suffers a ribbon injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in crucial king-class duels.
In the Munich mud weather, the defender broke off a training game and was driven from the field with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A stake in the eight-final draw against FC Chelsea on August 8 is unlikely to be possible, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
But the Bayern will not be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victorious title collectors in the next ideally 28 days until the final game of the King's Class on August 23.
"We have mastered the duties with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it is up to us to create the special,” Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve, however, for the first time, the eight-final obligation faces FC Chelsea.
After the 3-0 draw before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become a Bavaria nightmare again, as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” Flick said.
There will be a rematch on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, on a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players on Seven Street, including the new players around noble purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
“Leroy fits well like all the new ones,” Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to just co-train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team strength is now trained for the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game in contrast to the flick ensemble.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are possible opponents Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The world record goalkeeper Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-on-100 match.
With his current team, working is “a pleasure,” Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with Neuner-teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the performers, all were present, including the emigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the King class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All American races were cancelled.
The racing calendar is getting more and more concrete.
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the ten Grand Prix so far confirmed, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, it will be driven at the Nürburgring in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Cup points on the Italian traditional racetrack in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races according to the current status.
“We are delighted to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the king class of motorsport will be held in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the official races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, performances could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least three races on three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is supposed to be a world champion.
Using a special rule, the FIA wants to award the title on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled shortly due to the impending coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be hosted in America this year.
Rejection comes under criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being back with them next season," Carey said.
The rejection of the Americas races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The rejection came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Infection rates in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known latenight show via video and revealed in the interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. latenight show.
Among other things, she spoke of her struggle against the world’s powerful.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future, as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted an extended interview with the Swede.
In doing so, she spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
“How far people are going to shift the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are going to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her, find her “fun” as the reactions show her “because they have no other answer to it”.
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she took a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most widely used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at this point?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.”
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not anticipated the swift answer and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in memory of many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder real estate with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the goalie king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-Professional managed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted elfmeters in the replay times of both halves.
As a result, the 30-year-old from the fourth quarter has now 34 season goals on his account before the end of the season - the same number Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo followed with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, has died.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, an additional statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Fleetwood drummer and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all of the group’s winnings to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
At a young age, he became enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not overcome the media hustle, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success with an album inspired by religious themes in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swim on a successful wave without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he rejoined a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of recent decades.
