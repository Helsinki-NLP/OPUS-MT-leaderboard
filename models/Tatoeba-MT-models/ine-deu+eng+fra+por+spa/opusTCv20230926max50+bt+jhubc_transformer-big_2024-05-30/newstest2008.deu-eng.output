Food Due to European Inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the cost was higher than expected in November – after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are assuming only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered Leitzsins, which it believes will lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the midst of a crisis: Inflation needs to be “decided” in order to exclude the need for action at a later date.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve-year record high; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone is caused by the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat listings rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose 52 percent this year – last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts assume a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup's Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the Socialists, according to Gallup, has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
For the party-fidel voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are against one-fifth (20 percent) of the approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach 2% in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic mood has further deteriorated - never before has the share of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "pretty bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán makes up 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that one could manage the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
If, after the upheavals last October, 35% had voted for the remainder of the government and the head of government, today this percentage is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent answered that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20 percent would "probably" vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty", another 15 percent would consider their participation to be "probable".
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day allowance.
Turned to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Even the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year again this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent again this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered.
After the prices in the food markets "happened off" last December, the increase in percentage has not been drastic, compared to the already high, previous baseline level.
However, it is certainly dissuasive for consumers that what they paid far less than HUF 9,000 last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800, the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and peanuts have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-related price drop in the product to below 200 Forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola pawn bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including pawn cost only HUF 257.
However, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase in prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
It is precisely this process that has affected the trade: apparently the department stores could not quite decide what price range they should apply to the individual items, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the retailer is planning poorly the speed of circulation of a product, it can fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to value added tax, the cost of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 Forint more than the previous year, and even the cheapest one had a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was seen, with the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office found an increase of more than 30 per cent over the 12-month period.
So in addition to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has increased by just over 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is continuously reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices at all.
Large quantities are purchased from all, durable foods pass in pallets over the counters.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless snakes at the cash desk in all three department stores when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country is reporting a lower customer frequency, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the expected turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not directly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
Many places are also saved with disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has since not been performed due to the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By December 10 of this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogens have been safely registered in hospitals, but the dark digits are likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, almond inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or applied inappropriately, the well-responsive bacteria form antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with a weakened or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in the elderly, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the daily routine of the hospital.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA just does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are being isolated, the nursing staff are wearing rubber gloves and masks in care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are tested for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples taken too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the delivered patients and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Last but not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Therefore, most cases would only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among outpatients or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most often transmitted by caregivers from one patient to another.
This is why handwashing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drip cell infection or contact, but there is not always a possibility to isolate the infected patient in local hospitals.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the financially less well-off hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that even favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government Program Against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes the health insurance huge costs, so they are being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was retained in the government program.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections is declining in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Police chief was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now-retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the Budapest prosecutor’s spokesman, said on Friday after the official assessment on the case was submitted.
The assessment confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before sitting at the wheel.
The former police chief bogged into Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district, crossing the road at an unmarked location by a 55-year-old man.
(According to StVO, however, this is not an mitigating circumstance - the handlebars have, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, posterity.)
The pedestrian has sustained injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handler suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and applied for retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest, with the money to be spent on education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the framework of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting, the subway line 4 was also mentioned.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the cheapest market in the EU, but it is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most coveted patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with affordable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "golden coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the interior also attracts investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the highly favorable area of Ruse registers more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and thus, in addition to the summer and winter seasons, also attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors therefore already buy in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving for a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle either buy revitalized properties for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50-100,000, or downgraded houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5-15,000, which they renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are great, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual price increase of 21%.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the measures to reduce emissions for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a heated debate between industrialized and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on support to developing countries.
The adjustment fund subject to the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, expected to be in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s commitment to maintaining its leading role in global climate action and to reaching a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured in 1990 values), regardless of whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" will be successfully achieved. The Union would even be willing to commit to a 30% reduction if other large industrial countries in the world are committed to complying with their obligations.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the states that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU with its then 15 member states had already committed to a minus of 8 per cent.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will fully meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the report would not follow the new, international climate reduction system set out in the Kyoto Protocol.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and an increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage, shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, is checked at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where it is put on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Department of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign deployments.
Propaganda of this kind is almost free compared to conventional television commercials, defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise With Game
But the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also creates it on the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not told.
By the way, numerous videos shot on the platform have already been uploaded from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this "genre" has only recently been discovered by the British.
Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooter "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónica Lamperth is by no means skeptical: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas mood with tombola or bursts into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the defense resort, but the ministry's employees are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around $25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are striking the strands.
The Ministry of Economy’s 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration will be held in the house of the future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The main focus of the festivities is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a lottery draw.
The National Development Agency (NDA) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rental amounted to 1 million Forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was announced: There was no ball dress or suit requirement.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are preparing for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health is organizing the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Mónica Lamperth officially invites her employees not even to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the annual awards ceremony.
It is estimated that about 180 guests will be hosted only with coffee and pogatschi, according to the press department, so the celebration is expected to be 350,000 forints.
Minister of self-government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply meet in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas celebration in its own party hall, which is expected to have 436 employees.
Spending was measured at 2,500 Forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year’s reception on January 20th, the Ministry’s Christmas celebrations this time will be cancelled.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standby reception, to which only accredited foreign diplomats in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally start with a short speech by the minister and sound with a restrained whisper.
As the respective press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at either the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation are forming their coordination committee for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, on Monday - the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the shutdown of work begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic constraints are expected, as railway traffic is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large-scale protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday onwards, all organizations that have joined the strike will stop working indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
Should the National Council not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further steps.
Due to the National Council’s agenda on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will not be until late in the evening, or even at midnight, to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to face significant traffic obstacles: the railways are shutting down their work indefinitely, in the morning most of the public transport and more than half of the Volán companies stand still.
At the same time, there will be many highway blocks in one direction.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have followed the call for strikes - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, while others are planning a temporary shutdown.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ, although just around the Christmas holidays more and more people are travelling by rail.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be on strike from start-up until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA electricity and heat energy unions will shut down the work for four hours, and the teachers’ union, i.e. the Democratic Teachers’ Union, will have 2- and 2-8-hour strikes, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes alternately across the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government should take back the draft reform of health insurance and present a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, due from next year.
The third requirement is that the eligible occupational groups will be given access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to a short-term ethnic conflict".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition".
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so that since summer 2007, several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been established.
"It is common for these groups to define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly boasting that they are preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (disaster protection, national defense, law enforcement), invoking the inadequacy of the state police, the armed forces themselves," he said.
And further: all this is done according to that method, which tries to disguise as a bourgeois initiative various political aspirations based on the political and party aspirations of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association is therefore not merely to circumvent legal obstacles that may arise during the registration process - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard was the mass outbreaks of Roma, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization was "national protection".
In her opinion, for the past 17 years, a real "Gypsy terror" was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained idle and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk changing trends are detectable, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but next year will provide us with fewer such days.
In the EU and in America, something else is understood as "Holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Working days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working days - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are March 15, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August, the foundation of the state, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working days shifting" has proven to be proven in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holidays, is finally to be worked out, for many years the Minister of Labour has set in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public servants and civil servants alike.
Excepted are only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, including on public holidays.
This year, the rules of work are only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in this country remains formal, as most take time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holidays specifically cancelled for it.
Next year there will be more holidays in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-arrangements on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "put on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a day of rest.
The second re-arrangement is related to the holiday on October 23: On Saturday, October 18, you will have to work on Friday, October 24 in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be marked by the holidays, after December 24, everything will lie and stand still, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy co-workers
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid these misunderstood, for other annoying situations.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department,” says a colleague.
Did you miss a meeting because of this?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up again, perhaps by calling the marketing department and confessing remorsefully that you have forgotten to direct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it’s done with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for really unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than getting a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the sticker was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost-believe ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking, one should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, don’t put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit yourself: no more there if you’re in urgent need.
Dealing with the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues to the nose of everyone if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave instead of aligning those who are not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
When you call the office to report sick on the grounds of annoying headaches, because you feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, indisponible tasks, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by colleagues instead of one yourself.
Don’t play badly with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get into the office the next day, or that something could happen in between, why you need to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Gekicher, Telephone
You are just getting deeper into your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud chirping of your colleagues?
Did you hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which you have over their heads), trampling, sneezing or snoring.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deep into a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other people’s fault?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness in others!
If possible, you should not excuse yourself for the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected too!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or the failure to recover, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling at home?
Workout pants and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just do not become too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Wanting to make it all right - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds like mr2.
The local music scene has not pampered us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the congestion differently when you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage skirt with its guitar quilt is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a tavern can't stand two whistles - began to go his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not achieve until he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider public only when the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, became almost the only trendsetter marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one cared if they liked to wear this brand as well.
The band responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression originates from the time when Balázs Zságer was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying hint would be fine, but besides the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends, the influences of rock'n'roll, fall out.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
One song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late, has successively put the ear worm on the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How much of your music is reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and nonsensical, but they can also be produced only for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The readiness of the listener to receive also works according to this principle, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more of our concerts coming.
We have never written for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is mostly felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to do it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, even if you try to interpret it in our music over and over again.
We are more like team players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which is then supposed to come out as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to compose the choir of talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was formed - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls co-create it?
Zs.: The track has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this track still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally required a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically at once and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember I was pretty electrified at the time, but it also needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, they sing perfectly together, and they aren’t louder than the music, so their singing isn’t just accompanied by the music.
They were also behind on stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately didn’t want to give them solo roles.
The issue is also that one should forget one’s ego a little, forget who came from where and where is going, let us simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
Zs.: In the musical creative work, not at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and also now that I have released the album.
Currently, they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Ungrounded Scammer
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
Because of him, it was worth nearly five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, besides, he certainly wasn’t incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who pointed him to the police.
But according to Kerviels’ statements published by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros during the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had problems with repayment in the past, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and was right.
At the end of the year, he had screwed up his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I made the first half a billion dollars, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so as not to get caught.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the scenes, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
“I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as anyone else.
"Even when I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by betting half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I made money, they closed their eyes.”
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
How did they get to him?
Suspiciously, he took a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want you to look at his cards,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to reach $365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kronor comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kronor from the program "Company and Innovation".
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the expansion of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have more than 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative enterprises.
The aim is to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for company research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries to date in acquiring money from EU funds.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for ex-presidents
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the metropolis of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will be back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the detainees to have Alemán serve his sentence at home, or to have him imprisoned.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 campaign.
The budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and that was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law in complete peace.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
Everything governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more thankful topic for the media, which is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
In the past social democratic governments, state budgets suffered from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are mandatory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also about social expenditures decided by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficits in the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to open up additional sources of investment other than income from taxes, levies and bank loans, often inconsiderately issued bonds through which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already sealed.
Insofar as we adhere to only official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD continues to boast about it.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have acted much wiser than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace that is mainly attributable to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have been inflated in a gigantic way in recent years.
Although it has succeeded in eliminating some of the nonsensical populist spending adopted this year prior to the elections, it is clear that if there is not a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain pure to him.
It is only slightly exaggerated when you say that then from ruling politicians become officials who mechanically split most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenses.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only put an end to the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion kronor for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was just going on.
If we don’t really want to become mere administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we need to be patient with this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, calmly preparing further reform laws.
Only these will enable the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
This means that more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss central bank.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to deter or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties in the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," said Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for its clients.
“The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-performing loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what else could happen when they decided to do this," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank Rate, which is used for lending money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as further interest rate cuts," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by the central banks is contributing to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now related to the UN International Conference on Climate Change, which is coming to an end in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he stated that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a firework of words that is just a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
When introducing his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet on cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude unbiased.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but he believes he has sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and judge professional treatises, has experience in statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, and therefore did not pose a threat to climate change, and that the development of efforts to reduce climate change is not a threat.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from attendees, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken on the same subject at the Hayek Institute in Vienna two months ago.
600000 people were unable to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive at all have not exchanged their driver's license.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in the ticket exchange, the offices of the capital are overflowing with applications, and interest in the exchange has grown this week.
The city administration produces about 2,000 customers daily.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The issuance of a new driver’s license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will face a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also have it acted upon with an admonition.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the one from the municipality can get a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of as much as 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to impose a fine of up to 1000 crowns.
Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said no one was threatened with a thousand-crown penalty.
The driver’s license is a document where everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, namely a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive anymore should give their driver’s license.
It is enough to take him to the competent local authority or send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers will gradually have to change other types of driver's licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driver's licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are accused of having done something in common with the David Berdych gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided in a valid judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced their sentence by one and two years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today’s judgment, only revision by the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this case, but he is first facing the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he had already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
Moreover, he cannot be convicted.
A district court in January found 19 people guilty mainly of involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants disputed the accusation from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian district court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych, gave criminals information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped members of the gang escape law enforcement.
The gang left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík 30 percent of the loot.
The indictment is about gang crimes from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also for prosecution and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel cores, a laser targeting tube and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through its robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this case, Berdych and a number of others were legally found guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych’s district have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought to court.
To date, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting a final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have escaped the main hearing.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation of 12 million crowns from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
Therefore, the legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, does not entirely agree with Velebas’ proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is a multiple too high," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order for us to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the counter-party created.
We will find out if it is of any value at all.
But we insist that this should be in the range of hundreds of thousands for everyone," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should range between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion drawn up for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered mental damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermáks in Przybyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Moorish height) gave each family 100,000 crowns as a replacement for expenses incurred by them due to the failure of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for help from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, except for millions.
Polívka came for his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the battle for the brand "Kingdom of Wales".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate parasiticly in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the hearing.
In the words "Walachian Kingdom" everyone imagined this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to parasitic gain from our work,” he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
He was crowned in 1993 by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, this was not connected with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom at the time.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized out of an initially fun action, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to its owners when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial purposes.
"Polyvka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Welsh kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who had devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the parties that are now in dispute lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until the day of St. Nimmerlein".
The leadership role was then claimed by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and a half princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn’t want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the king's move in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also calmly sign up," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Preliminary parts fade
To tell the truth, I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that’s much better.
The combo with the name SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the low headlessness on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the combi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly go ahead
I only go through the interiors briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I only have objections because of the worrying middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The lateral support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
In terms of space, the enlarged dimensions of the body can also be felt here.
In the combo, the already mentioned lack of headlessness is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading compartment.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is clearly 52 liters behind.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading area after the rear seats have been folded or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a capacity of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that’s what a 1600 cubic engine that drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls well away.
If I compare him to his <0xC5><0xA0>koda counterpart, which sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a flap, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still on the rise.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car hits again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head fairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper trigger, electric window lifters at the rear and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 kroner.
That’s a lot, but if you add up the extras of a Fabia, you’ll get a very similar amount.
The only thing left to do is decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in UK schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually escalating.
Disputes, bullying and robberies among students have spread to the relationships between the parents.
The situation has evolved so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had made allegedly racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"As we were going home, a boy climbed on a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then uncovered his buttocks,” a mother of Slovak students told The Times of another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here in search of work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was liked to be seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, over the wide boulevards cars drove, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails to your liking.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported schigulis and fiats have long since collapsed in the salty and damp air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may have fallen sharply, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow gauges to the sugar factories.
Its fleet has not been renewed for decades, so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have been in the museum for a long time.
Excursion Destinations
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You don’t have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Just to mention that in the already mentioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum, the visit of which should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the TV series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad and Tobago
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth embodied in the beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed in four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country until the 1950s.
This isolation contributed to it being disregarded.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "valley of sugar factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánamo have to overcome high and steep mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its pristine nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, you can see several table-mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess themselves, you could yell many pages about all this.
But, as they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of the necessary equipment affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO should, in the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country in Edinburgh, Scotland, agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for more activity by NATO units, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, a forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start developing the economy and security themselves,” British Defense Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the U.S. Army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and about the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said the same thing today.
“I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan non-storm disguises: The Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," the "Sun" wrote in a post, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image newspaper went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to one trillion in 2009
The Czech Republic owes a total of 84,000 crowns to the government.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion cones this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to $152.8 billion thanks to better development of state budget policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Treasury Department confirmed its data on government debt in early October.
A debt of SEK 84000 is owed to each Czech.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the one trillion kroner limit until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance: "We could exceed one trillion in 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, that could take until 2010.
But I am not assuming such a change," he noted.
Debt grows
State debt comes from the debts of the state government and mainly comes from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has risen to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The government’s foreign debt has risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly recorded in the bonds, where the growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debts are rising, but on the other hand, this shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and government debt management for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kronor for this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach SEK 76 billion instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
This includes a maximum amount of 13.3 billion kroner for the Consolidation Agency, a ten billion reserve to pay pensions, 43 billion for sovereign debt and 1.8 billion for bonds with the European Investment Bank.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be beaten.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum was picked up at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this issue begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Surely, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Subsequently, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knows her well and she would never have done anything that could have brought her too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it is only a mistake and a matter of guilt.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe her as being very attentive to her students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This surname, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
At the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the End of Failure
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika had been ordered by the UN last August to conduct a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia has been and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years under UN administration, the Western countries consider EU-supervised independence to be the only solution for the future.
Pristina is willing to declare them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations were the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, a former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly provoking a “domino effect” in a region that is still so much weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision would be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where their Russian ally holds a veto.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They have to end the way they started: in the Security Council.
To the journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will be conducted in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush Reveals Israeli-Palestinian Deal
At the opening of the international peace conference, which he chaired in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the peace roadmap they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty that will clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation encompasses the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict, which became the present-day state of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement on all points, including listing Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, in turn, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption, and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set a deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli, which exist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received assurances from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has embarked on a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a turning point in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi prince said in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors confront each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on track, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue lights, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without license, so not released for public road transport (see below), came, driven by two youths without a helmet, approached at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after disregarding its ancestor from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control performed on the vehicle passengers has a lot of negative effects.
The condition of the car (broken wing, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the stiffness of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation on the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in consultation with the General Directorate for Security.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the police from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this small power bike has reached its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles remained stuck together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsyed yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rumour that the police had left the scene very quickly, without providing any help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations, for which further investigation is needed and in which one must proceed very carefully.
Libération has witnessed these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who was behind.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
Given the tension that had quickly developed around the incident and, apparently, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers who had arrived at the scene of the accident were taken in the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also applied heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police did not help the youth.
First aid was given to these young people.
The firefighters came right away.
Everything was done to try to save them, the prosecutor stressed on her part.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police put down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court’s lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the advocacy movement received the support of religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency, and to those who have made an oath of Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid.
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to surrender command of the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency was called, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the rumours persisting in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than one-third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Eight out of ten births are planned carefully these days.
For one in five couples even calculated accurately on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A bold exit that, due to its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon accommodate the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-tonne module for power generation via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it to its final position.
After displacing it, the crew proceeded to restructure the module’s solar panels with a span of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable over a length of about one meter.
Restructuring was stopped to avoid further damage to the collector.
Astronauts who originally left the Discovery space shuttle for a check-in and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old trained doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fastened some sort of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained close to the lock, and, from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped with an insulator to prevent electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had been conceived and crafted by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting down his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery, expected to embark on the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion to counter A400M debris, the EADS stock is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS is losing 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its business forecasts for 2007 again, referring to the residues caused by the only slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, more than one billion of which for Airbus, the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007, he added, without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month arrears.
As a reminder, EADS’s business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday, the counting of the votes will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very locked-down election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message broadcast on public broadcasters to voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president left nothing unseen when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and we hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have defended themselves.
It denounces an election campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Yeltsin.
After suppressing the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
Following these non-tensional parliamentary elections, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the power so far will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their destiny, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, bourgeois society has only developed very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again adhered to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are freely renouncing the personal responsibility they have for a short time demonstrated after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why long to think about?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What to consider for a long time?
Those in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy reminder
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven government-appointed states – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for investigations, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced laborers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental impairment of some deportation victims.
The prisoner lists of the concentration camps or the detention orders issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new is to be expected in these documents, Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India have agreed to a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission’s figures, India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will push the two economies enormously forward and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India to the European Union, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants are exchanging goods worth 47 billion euros annually and services worth 10 billion euros, said this week trade minister Daniéle Smadja, president of the European Commission in New Delhi.

Bank of England takes note of the unrest and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring worries over credit terms, announcing a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer with a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to alleviate the fears that conditions on the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organize their liquidity positions during this time, the Bank intends to start with a significant share of its savings deposits in the form of 6th of March.
The bank further explains that in this way, at 12.15 GMT on December 6, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be put into circulation, at the basic tax rate and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the day-to-day different interest rates of interbank loans with their base rate.
The day-to-day interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has plummeted to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented banks from taking advantage of them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more advantageous rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, produced as part of a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), stated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which were 50% for employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP floating, for a transport check or for the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered occasion for partly heated exchanges between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television post on purchasing power.
The leader of PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present all of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks for the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
“We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are eagerly working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
We were negotiating with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are meeting preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago after it, together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival, became a part of the festival world in 2002.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million and $11.8 million respectively in gross tax days in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban one on the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's reception capacity is "very large", corresponding to the approximately 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who won the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one less than the Terminator opposes it.
These lockdown attempts are among the tasks of the delegates.
A politically "heavy mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, advancing the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, though that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, reviewing them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market on the verge of an end-of-year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With nearly five weeks to the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming final-year rally.
However, experts are unable to make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that, purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market developments.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secured equity funds, which increases the value of pension funds due to the upward trend in value.
Accordingly, in the opinion of these experts, the exchange will be more likely to show a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially since we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increase in the crude oil price and the risk of rising.
Javier Barrio, Head of Sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The odds are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak of 15,945.7 points on November 8.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidization of the pension fund carried out each year around that time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could change slightly, especially due to the end-of-year rally already in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the current assessments of the market situation are on an almost technical level, which could lead to a possible deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
Analysts are confident that they will be positive.
In selecting the values that will drive the Ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney says that this year the big values are in order.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will accompany the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas holidays, in the last half of the year, periodic consumption will determine what is happening in the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this brought the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year-end rally so far.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December saw a 6.68 percent price increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will show.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group, it dares to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 20.30h and start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The Banking Group BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, if not for the customer.
Whether more banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to the opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the shopping clientele of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new opening hours, but changed.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of the opening hours is combined with a new spatial design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía offices have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit, are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be a competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus outperforms its rival Antena 3.
We've made it.
With this phrase, Telecinco CEO Paolo Vasile expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange, the channel he runs had increased its value by twice that of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: this is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the value of the company now reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento with only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half at 2,193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that these are two similar companies, Vasile said.
It is unclear to what extent we can actually act in stock market technology, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to be the first TV channel to grow this year with more than 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as stated by Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the TV business was only able to show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see the main factor for Telecinco’s comparatively better stock market performance as the company’s high payout ratio so far: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always indicated significantly more so far.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is due to the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.

Congress approves the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its session with the resolution of Congress in the Senate on the additional/amendment proposals related to the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
Representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of Congress and Senate MPs, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible arrangement that ensures the safety of investors and regulates individual business activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market development.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID seeks to improve investor protection, increase the controlling power of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services firms (ESIS), the advisory firms that combine with investment and securities brokerage companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated circulating markets the multilateral securities trading systems and the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic actors.
The law obliges investment firms to notify the focus of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s task of control.
The Congressional Economic Commission foresaw further changes in the aftermath, with the decision that the bonds with titles now have to be considered complex financial assets due to their high level of risk to the investor, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of graduate economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the fields of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time to several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HPI) rose five-tenths in November to 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by publishing the data, aim at a local and quality comparison of US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the pre-determined indicator only serves as a guideline and therefore does not have to match the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to deputy head of government and finance minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index will remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nonetheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union in recent years has remained more or less the same.
He also said that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenue of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have fallen by more than half since the bank requested emergency loans from the UK’s central bank in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, an amount that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customers’ trust and despite the government’s one hundred percent guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the takeover under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to contribute about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be there from the investments of the next three years to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 (equivalent to about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually on advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve his goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, which has three more companies involved, as its preferred bidder to keep it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested this morning the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), belonging to the municipality of Murcia, on the grounds of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo was elected last May to the office of Juan Morales, currently a deputy of the Popular Party and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could be the original wire puller of the plot, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER.
The officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was charged, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested when leaving his client’s residence due to important incriminating documents linked to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged contract payments Morales to a Galician construction company, which envisaged the conclusion of an urban contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE’s candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of Congress President.
José Blanco, PSOE organising secretary, and Bono announced this at a press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would appear to be running for the presidency of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as congress president, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer run for office in the next general election, ending his career in public policy and engaging instead in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the Prime Minister had continuously pushed for his return to political events.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economics, did not want to prevent citizens from taking the post of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency .
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or shouting, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you get the impression that the only place in Madrid where you can not talk quietly and quietly is the congress; this is how the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to make it appear that he had already assumed office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subjected to ruthless criticism from both climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of it, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in need of clarification regarding the actions or non-actions of his government, which has contributed decisively to Spain’s position at the top of the EU’s list of countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance of the specifications, to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages against climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected, which behavior of citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences will result.
Specifically, who will have to sacrifice themselves and pay for saving the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can actually be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed to Zapatero strategically so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise suitable for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding expense of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and the chief of police of Totana because of an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, belonging to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor have been detained on suspicion of urban violations, he said today.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in whose premises he is located to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the investigations already carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it was found that more than 2 million hectares of unfinished construction land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be transformed into a local administration.
In addition, two other people were not arrested directly, but underwent an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six detainees were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the CEO of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company operates as a part of the Nuaria group and is said to have received the lubrication money.
The investigations are being carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies that were directly related to the detainees in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Las Rozvedra.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the municipality of Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired in Totana over 2.2 million square kilometers of land to be rebuilt, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializes in the installation and sale of the promotion, the verification.
Things that can happen
Article 3
If you agree, we will turn away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of another name with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your suggestions.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland is by the way at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on November 18th; accidentally, the book on that day was published.
After the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela, the content of the subject philosophy has become a subject of public debate.
One of the culprits was a high school student who cited the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, Chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, urged teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato, and suggested that Plato’s teachings from the sub-levels of the Philosophy curriculum for the subject of Philosophy at Gymnasiums.
Article 3
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would involve six months in detention.
However, if you rob a music store with a value of less than 400 euros, this is considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is considered a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you pick up a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebel conflict entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not taken place is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has raised his demands.
Article 4
My GP handed me one of his long, strange research papers titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomography-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their response and therefore received the same salary; but if one of them received twice as much, it also resulted in stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years, and her seat is in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her term of office will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian foot leader Radohinvan.
Their names are on the list, which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach uses as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, haunts the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York with the aim of pursuing them, pressuring them to escape and stalking them.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible accident caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of production of the driver’s license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to provide the corresponding amount of indemnity in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver's license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accident, higher contributions are also due.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to pay less contributions, because statistics prove that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and accordingly also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single people.
The benefit that is attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also thoroughly study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance that most likely meets his personal needs.
At this point, we list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance- but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under the age of 25 encounter numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving experience and a young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full-casco with self-employment, so that while the benefits of full-casco insurance are covered, they are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay part of the amount incurred by the damage itself.
The amount is set before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damages caused on his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to lower your insurance costs, so your credit increases by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the respective insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said rates.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its profits.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, due to the fact that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Therefore, it is most sensible to opt for full insurance with self-employment.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been relieved.
However, in the case of a married client who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out full-case insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person also allows it.
Insurers consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full-case insurance with self-employment (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is a good idea to take out full insurance with self-employment (at an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which is only used with a sufficient amount of credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require that a thorough selection be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to score a point for the semi-finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight on Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up to Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time to enter the final on the 13th in the semi-finals, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished before everyone else and the draw at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be in case of a group star victory and thus would have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be defeated in a loss of FC Shakhtar to qualify, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are allowed to participate at nine points of equality; they had lost (2-1) in Glasgow last week, but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
Accordingly, the Milanese will try to beat the Scots in the evening, who hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being beaten by a goal from Kaka in the follow-up time (1-0) and by a zero to zero on the draw in the previous season.
While FC Shakhtar awaits Rossoneri’s victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the semi-finals and their membership in UEFA depends on their victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica could win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 viewers after the band's break-up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the band's mood was changing again.
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, which showed a video about the history of the band that had caused furor in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album that includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, previously given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it in the previous days.
While preparing for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star has not even seen our wardrobe before, so I’m really looking forward to what he thinks of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the dissolution of the group, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not; so I’m glad to have made this decision, Chisholm commented on the breakup of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes have been resolved and that everyone is now enjoying each other again.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
First, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to a report from CTV.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nanny girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is swelling between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conducted by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for imports from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed prices up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of pre-trial detention records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the supervisory body.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish state health service does not have a precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a SUV drove through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to conduct checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-trial records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the chief auditor now states, among other recommendations, that the board should adopt guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report said.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines before hiring, but added: “Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health workers is available.”
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says NHS Scotland’s current pre-employment tests are working well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver,” he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards had problems identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been predominantly complied with.
This includes passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices in updated guidelines regarding check-ups before hiring all staff - including those from abroad next month - would be reflected in their publication.
Joy Division dominates film awards ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for best film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world public.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at age 23.
The black-and-white film, featuring The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards for the Dutch photographer Corbijn, most famous for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the centerpiece of another award-winning ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian Mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia over terror plot
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has arrested 208 militants because of their membership in cells that had planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant as well as on clerics and security forces.
The state-run television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, was planning an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing an interior ministry statement, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who immigrated to the country illegally.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 detainees were reportedly planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking Iraq to team up with al Qaeda militias that want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clerics in Saudi Arabia to be cooperating with authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias — accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government — have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very large effort by the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a “media cell” of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote “takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet resembles an Earth-turned-away twin even more than previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unrestrained carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different course of evolution.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express space probe, which examined the plant for a year, provide a sobering insight into how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
“Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
One kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidate finally declared himself ready to engage in a debate on YouTube in which normal voters record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is set to break up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with those who selected YouTube clips to show to the prospective candidates.
However, the first half-hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to use a ballot box when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was relentless with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two argued particularly strongly as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give the illegal a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, succeeded in tackling the issue.
Neither of the two men has a serious chance at the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they’ve mowed on the immigration paws earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share broadly the same views: sharper borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, coupled with fears about poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now against all expectations in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would support them, he laughed and said Jesus was too smart to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two were shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party had not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink at the two wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No nobles seem to have been sold, no politicians in Paris paid hotel bills, no extramarital toes stolen.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has veiled donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which competing Gordon Brown would have done well.
When the Prime Minister withdrew from the demand for an election two months ago, foolishly insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced that decision, there was hope that it would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen Liberal Democrat representative, put it, the once-feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a beleaguered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have provoked corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of 25 million people’s personal data showed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest of cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Chief Executive) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably sets off in the direction of resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new troop takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there for long, this postponement is over: public service is starting to leak; cabinet ministers are starting to chatter; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he can’t claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-general.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misfortune – as in the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding – voters may assume that he was.
However, Brown’s situation is not as bad as it looks.
The faults are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what of course Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new witness for political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but he was not allowed to make the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for one clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s deal but didn’t say it was illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial officer, who was told about the odd donations in October.
But so far, Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted that determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject—to fill the measure—by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indisputable integrity and solid competence.
Card shark
Is the credit crisis affecting America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it’s only natural that spinal fleas swirl excitedly around.
Now that America’s real estate market is crippled, predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the payouts and the salary rates, which measure the share of loans that are non-recognizable or more than 30 days late in each case.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card borrowers.
It is still too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody’s, the third-quarter growth rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency law in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large part of the tedious card losses; the number of filings (and hence tuition fees) would rise again whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that spending for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infectious channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt now that home loans are dried up.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be advantageous for card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates will decrease if the properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden cover-up crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be sued for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their claims to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been set for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were announced in the UK during two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation that began after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against her in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to cover up a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron estates that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepresented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others missed about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence at Louisiana Federal Prison.
Copper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on bail on the basis of a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debt or make weakening ventures seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were invalidated after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulf Stream stand last Friday at the millionaire’s exhibition, a four-day orgy of out-of-the-box consumption, held in an enclosed exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly raised Russians in everything from mahogany-paved yachts to diamond-coated car grills, which would be reasonable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously pointed a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest trade fair stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas in its glorious days.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi overflights of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the world’s most visible free-lance money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank estimates that 15.8% of Russians lived below the minimum standard of living in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well cared for and men are all worth a fortune.”
As they walk through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand for several hours in the traffic jam to visit a congested warehouse that tastelessly designs Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, and bespoke ice cream.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-track logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers of pieces that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or just tourists, were pushing through the halls every day.
And some of them bought it.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with stitched gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customers, said he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chain straps tied together, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a quadruple.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconia will not necessarily ride on these wheels," Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaires” would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend they were rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells in the British model, which were filled with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire’s fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the heaps of money around, take mobile phone photos as they lean back in the middle of the substitute wealth, be snapped by friends, or simply plug in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Missed operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at White Cape Cod stopped two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's bodyguard's box cart approaching," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities learned that the dead woman, Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized, cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212 .
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help clarify a mysterious death that sent a mourning through the leadership of Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and persistent," McCarthy said about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney General Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a veiled rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian bellows behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him find his way into the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets through further interest rate cuts were bolstered by reassuring comments by the U.S. central bank vice president.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the No. 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank’s chairman, said the policy needed to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to continued pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm thunderstorm markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had “partly reversed some of the improvements in market functionality from the late part of September and October.”
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into U.S. markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street down, given further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 Index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressure on markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month guarantee auction of European Central Bank funds granted to the European Commercial Banks was granted to a considerable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and feed more capital into London’s money markets rose when credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates for lending between UK banks rise at 6.59 percent to their highest since late September.
England faces decision on statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, at the invitation of at least this special title, and because the table of High Morries, the English Managing Director, is gradually not in place with applications for national voters.
Whoever does not get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It’s never easy to pinpoint exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his or her profession, while someone else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is this the best time to go to Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances have this too.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket, and a wrestler must get regular chances on the order when he wants to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better off in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind cone into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their glow points and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to solidify himself at the time, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, although he still doubles a hundred against Australia, may be below.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moore, after further discussion in the course of today’s networking session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is 22 years younger than seven, and an excellent record against twisted balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against the West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating still open in Bomb.
In contrast, the Essex all-rounder has shovel-like life-joy.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket pitch and his stance away from it was brought to the point when he recently overtook a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched it from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he cone his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to match him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the true art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be doing well, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and to Fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out, and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now.”
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia had helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion west of the capital, urging him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight Al Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the rise of US troops and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who armed and defended their neighborhoods in cooperation with the US military.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and squandering funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country’s sectarian death squads.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis not to be given visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were displaced from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarlanders express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I declared to a non-Saharan country that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest state self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
As a result, universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students here can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is high with 15.6 percent.
But even the land children bring the Saarland in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a high school degree.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their qualifications at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In terms of population, the equipment with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"At the general education schools, after the first Pisa study, we have initiated a number of reforms," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last kita year is free of charge - a model that other federal countries are now copying.
Whether the performance of students will improve sustainably will only be shown by future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of students at risk fell from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not grow as strongly as other federal states.
Bavaria is better.
And for the sake of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligatory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela, the clock will tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timers in the South American country back half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez has become a joke.
According to the official newspaper of Venezuela, according to a new law, the clocks will be set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that there is not in any other country in the world.
The U.S.-hostile Chávez justified his decision on the grounds, among other things, that the United States had imposed full-time time zones on the world.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage affair the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the oil nation's citizens will have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate of negotiating with Marxist rebels in Colombia involved the release of hostages was the trigger of the dispute.
Uribe spit Venezuela in the face with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile ringtone is causing furor in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
Speaking to him was Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-America summit was annoyed by the left-populist’s constant cries of intermittance and had run over his mouth.
Germans threaten 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economy, German workers are projected to lose real wages this year.
Experts cited a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could actually expect less in salary in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for this is the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price surges in food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also be borne by workers in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has detected flashes in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe “Venus Express” has provided the evidence – it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine “Nature”.
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning bolts created life on Earth: storms in the ocean are said to have triggered reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
“If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” said Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes with temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the Earth's devil twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has evolved so completely differently is the basic question of the ESA mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus exploration, as no probe has been on its way to explore this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research findings, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially assumed," the ESA said in a statement.
In addition to the already well-known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second thinnest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost as large as the Earth with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in nearly 225 days.
It revolves much slower around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in the oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I respect the diversity of cultures,” said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the federal president, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not renounced the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed resentment over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were fierce irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only sent out the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from SPIEGEL, also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama’s reception as an error.
China rejects it when European politicians officially welcome Tibetan religious leaders, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of crawls like in France
Street battles with police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of crazies like in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from unleashing violence on the streets, the Federal Interior Minister demanded.
Barricades burned, gunmen shot the police with shotguns: After the severe youth crackdown in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We must be careful that we do not build up social explosives and release them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hannover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this is already showing first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as there are in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
However, greater integration efforts by the federal government were called for by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the turmoil in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 is "exceedingly high".
In particular, more training places need to be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany there is more "social control in the families" than in France.
In addition, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat admonished, "But we must still be careful."
“Young people should be given a quick opportunity to participate in work and education.”
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were deployed, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
Competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a task force of about 1000 security forces has provided peace of mind.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
Overnight on Tuesday, about 80 policemen were injured in crawls in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots swept over Toulouse.
The clutches ignited in a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor’s office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the youth.
In the Realm of Angela Cloud
The chancellor’s far-reaching appearance documents that the coalition’s contents are at an end – and that nothing more can be expected from her.
In what country does this Federal Chancellor live?
After her despondent appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was cumbersome and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
The accusation that she focusses too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an outrageous sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing first that she does not want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented to everyone how true their accusations are.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke introduced herself: an upbeat politician who flees to foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Example of climate protection: There she boasts undeterred for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
At all, the self-praise - so much inmodesty the CDU head would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flask that the revival is coming to the people.
This damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautifying the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low earners?
She's got a few sets left.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to child support.
It takes Merkel three runs to come up with a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack (disambiguation)
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivering a hard blow exchange – and now must fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already relieved in the first theme.
He has made New York a "refugee for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This, in turn, counters with serious accusations: "I would say his own house was a harbour for illegals," Giuliani opposes and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-reported 30-second videos that Internet users upload via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the Vietnam veteran to read the Levites vigorously when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
But that the campaign’s important themes are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause in the auditorium burns up.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, pleading with base and television audiences that he was still one of the advocates of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into trouble when he is asked what he thinks about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is ruling for the first time.
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure in particular from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on November 3.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling a further demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which had occupied lawyers weighed with Musharraf after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany’s Supergroup of the Seventies is re-musicing: The three band members of Harmonia once again performed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a clip from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
At that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The supposed sensation then takes place in the form of three men sitting at the dinner table.
Everyone has their boxes in front of them, their cables and especially their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in a white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds up to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band is re-musicing Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here we can reveal: Targeted demands revealed that although the name wandered through the collective pop memory, it was not as sustainable as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always more valid in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003 the Echo Award for life’s work, in the hall questioning German pop faces were seen.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration abroad is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony, because the trio existed for only two years and during this time also developed a much less effective power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played music under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had worked briefly at the power plant and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban municipalities.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a babysitter.
Rather in an artist's way.
It is alleged that a wreath of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association was also found in the garbage dump and that there was a name for the art.
Some held on to harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Because the music sounded so soft and modest, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice was not only for self-discovery.
The CD "Live 1974" was cut during a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-headed record set, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother then came the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as Flaming Hearts.
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing Krautrock as a genuine German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would outline the full range of Krautrock's influences on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s sentence floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures that show the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
For legendary purposes, projections of other black and white photographs of wired devices are used.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to unleash unprecedented sounds to the instruments via self-built effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical Tüftler.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, she is tossed and whispered under sound clouds and sings "Aaaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful place.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (powerhouse) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who call here "'68!" are not entirely wrong, and Harmonia can not be brought out of it even now.
Even the most obvious ones are thoroughly rethought on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
"The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" are again two films dealing with the Balkan war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and packing or they are too stirring.
Richard Gere can't help it in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s recently, because too many nice-looking roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove one out of the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and confusing today?) maybe.
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of course if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man who has his very best times long after him, but who, even as a ruin like monument of his decline, has a considerable amount of evidence of his decay.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" continues with the German production of "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serb from Kosovo hedgehogs, after which one of them quickly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that here once the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evils, the flat-screen film is lost too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, at "The Hunting Party" it is possible to explore exemplary why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and writer (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go into the forest to do something the military can’t do, and both times it’s going to be a trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downed cynic with the heart when he's introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
The Hunting Party finally goes down the creek when reporters succeed in the last five minutes of the time-lapse process in what NATO, the CIA and all the top money hunters in the world have failed in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a profoundly human nature.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to walk around, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this case they should agree exceptionally) not to pursue the persecution too intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good intentions and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen foreheads, indicating: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq movies were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: there has never been a good South Africa movie either.
Almost always true: When a star wanders around the crisis herds or minefields of the world, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Frontiers" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably be ripe - the Vietnamese classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on the same two screens, even just too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that robs screenwriters of the carefreeness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have also become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don’t want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically distanced artist’s gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières' Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia.”
By Beust received criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor’s rejection of Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has come under fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many people want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
However, Beust urges realism in assessing opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project in the city has recently developed such great motivational forces as the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the sporting political momentum could not be sustained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to “starting from a changed time frame.”
Mayor Ole von Beust said earlier Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the sports federation’s decision on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which is expected to take place in early December.
“This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period we are considering until 2028.”
However, the dream has not been dreamed of forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beusts' statements.
This creates the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this time," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the German Association of Higher Education Sports.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD-citizenship faction accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and outlawed housing," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Little Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally set the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time had sparked a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and Wooden Box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s work directory.
Most of the ninety-four "Type Stockholm" brillo boxes listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago, Kunstox International has raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: the six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has also published in 1995.
Prehistory is intertwined, a confusing link between artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap powder cartons "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, exhibited hundreds of brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but models of them, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses are now talking about about fifteen boxes, which at the time entered art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, three of which were privately owned in Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first ground and glazed off, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press plate with a paint roller without a primer - moreover, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says Moderna Museum Director Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the copy of the Moderna Museum's material will be removed."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced to investigate the “heavy accusations” raised in the case of the soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have remained inexorably silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered who hid in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government-loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The about two dozen soldiers had been entangled in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiation to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who were supposed to guard him, apparently overtook him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"The people have had enough," Trillanes said.
“We are calling on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by accusations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the military against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours at the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05% of the capital.
It had previously been speculated about an acquisition.
The option to increase the proportion of versatils is still open.
With this step, we want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, there had already been speculations about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house held the shares only for a third party, it said on the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drillisch with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started talks on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to settle for a good 10 percent share of Freenet and not use their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet poker, which has been around for months and is still hard to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full connectivity customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of Freenet’s shares so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another 4%.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
