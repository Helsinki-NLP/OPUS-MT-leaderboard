It's really exciting.
She's always taking good care of her old dad.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like it's cold.
I'm a pedestrian.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not going to use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
Our water was sore.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking forward and backwards.
Tom lifted the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He probably still has it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was frightened.
I've watched so far.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.

That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.

This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are idiots.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever shot a gun before?
I really liked that tattoo.
Get a ticket for the money.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back later?
I feel lonely in this city.
What have they done so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom was doing what Mary told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he tries to redeem himself.
Tom doesn't know how to pretend.

I love honey.
I have to admit something.
Alcohol had an effect on him.
Dan decided to leave the city.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around him.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's got a little blur in his cheeks.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered yes.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be bold with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually eat lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big a guy for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one is judging you.
Stop slandering Tom.
What could go wrong?
When will I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast afterwards.
Are you helping her?
Are you two family members?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it in my account.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he do his best?
Mary rewrote the film.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary punched John.
Tom, I wrote this report.
Are they bought like this?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.

Do we really eat pizza so early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke in French.
He shaved himself.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
You want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs whenever I get a cold.
We met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you can understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Anybody else in the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me horribly in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that was still worth the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
We have to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what it said in the newspaper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you back.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cockroaches.
You don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want rehearsals.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be okay.
Mosquitoes transmit malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't get it.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also receive checks.
Newspaper costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four verbs: pronounced, conditional, commanding and superior.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected her traits like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is now a martyr.
Tom seemed furious.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our courtyard is big.
It's a kid's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom's throwing me in the fucking motherfucker.
I was only an hour away.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must continue.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't get attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
There's no gasoline.
Tom's a trawler.
Who's on your list?
He has an alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Dare I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Make sure you don't get dirty in the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
This is the day they will try to escape.
They've all gone mad.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since she was a nurse.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still validated.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
That's weird.
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's russian room.
There are no survivors.
She should have been silent.
I'm not like you!
“It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.”
They were quietly smiling.
I'm not gonna forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I got him a slap in the face.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That's gonna work.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in our society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.

Turn around.

We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll catch up on it right away.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Let's go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Remove the clamp.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Didn't you like the prize?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
They're being dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in there.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
- Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory's a tap.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like the school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?

Let's forget about it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
His sleeve's stuck.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet! Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.

I'm the madman.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
A disgrace!

Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!

After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did he ask for the money?
Hold him! Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.

What is that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.

I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.

How innocuous you are.
Did someone hit Tom? No.

Don't go down there.

Avoid her.

Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up a tent.
That was so beautiful.
Allow me to stay.

If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
“I want to travel, too.”
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I was the one who wanted to meet Tom.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom's richer than we thought.
I never intended to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a couple of people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and fled to the window.
I know your strain.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.

There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so let it be.
Dan was a very caring dad.
Are you a vegetarian?
He took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking on my knees.
I know what that sounds like.
Tom didn’t seem to mind sitting alone.
I already feel much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure has taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want to be seen.
It's a pity that the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a cocksucker.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to be quiet.
I'm stubborn.

Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn’t read it.
They forced him to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room's full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn’t resist.
Tom's still messed up.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear it.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That's not a big priority.
Here, take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got what he wanted. He had a lot of money.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned up his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never surrender.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes the idea.
It’s the first time I’ve seen a cockroach this spring.
You want to play?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?

Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care of yourself!
Linda had a nausea and suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 outside the main gate.

She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I will do what I know and can do.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, he's fine.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't gossip.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a lusty dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything for nothing.
The worst type of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn my back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary stumbled into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved this puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.

You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's in big trouble.

Who were you with?

The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely survived.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll be better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise for a whole year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just approach a woman and scratch her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I love her.
Find your own supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom is seated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I go on?
He was blowing a lot.
I am a patient man.
That's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and deceived than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was shallow.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several watertight parts.
Given what you've been cooking, I'm going to wash dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You must not lose your condition.
He's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the beating?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh no!"
He's not as shy as he used to be.
Contash?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom's never been mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very easy to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played jackals, some tiles, some with a ball. Others rode or rode wooden horses.
Suspicion destroys friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not a lot of milk in the bottle.
We both need to go.
“The pain that love causes is sweeter than any pleasure.”
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come on over here.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You hit your head.
We're drowning.
Get the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is furious.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
Today is less humid than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It is strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Isn't there anything you can do?
Tom had no family.
I can't tell who loves the baby because he's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom had a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom. Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false clue.
Tom was fighting.
I said it might turn.
I need you to open the door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix things?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're at lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slit on one side.
Let's have a bite.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can't even read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
They're all waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you've made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is it about Tom?
Tom asks Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first to ask the question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we'll need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does it cost?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What is the state of Boston?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I was just cramping into my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me right now.
My cat is very happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard it right.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He gave his best.
He's a greedy guy.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mommy's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that risk.
This house needs to be repaired.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a creep.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them right away.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is it Necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never fall in love with you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you'd better call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want to work in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I really like German donuts.
We were 18 years old then.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate carrots.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running.
Go on with it.
This is negligible.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom injured?
You're drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Be polite.
You're gorgeous.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and imagine a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan was pretending he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
It was so much worse.
Tom tries to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I only had one glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm looking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth full.
They've all been checked.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm just calling you as much as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What did you do last?
We won.
Tom says he has never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
We're being oppressed.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not very hard-boiled.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, not expecting anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot in here, you can take your coat off.
I don't think they were following me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You have the right to a phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I do my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I wouldn't want to get tangled up.
Their friendship quickly evolved into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the light.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill in the forms.
I don't imagine a party like that, but how you like it.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom fried his toast with butter.
We have work ahead of us.
I heard it like a whistle.
Shall we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the ridge.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
Soon it will be Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seems to be used to this sort of thing.
You'll be all right.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the mushrooms.
He rarely went there.
Tom's sick.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the victors are always right, and the defeated are the culprits.
Tom gave it to Mary the doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if you can at all say it is possible.
It was an arena day.
I've got bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome the weakness.
How many squats do you do every day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Don't you have a random key?
Let’s be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom's out of work.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was beating on alcohol.
Tom's getting better.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little attitude.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come for you, Tom.
He won first place in the match.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed late.
You're a whore.
They were all silent.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
That's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times so far.
Somebody open the door.
Do you own this?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that what we need?
He was desperate because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got ear pain.
Dan hit him on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
This song is stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car bounced.
Now it's all over.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on his mind, Tom?
Mother’s advice would outweigh friendliness.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
Tom's mad.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My grandparents are from Germany.

What a beautiful sight!

This is hard for her.
Mary put on a carpet.
She's got a picture.
He's a good swimmer.
The flowers are blooming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, under urgent!
We're so sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
By no means would I want to stumble.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to be quiet.
Tom said Mary was making a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a traveler.
I'm flying from school.
I often heard him playing the tune of the trumpet.
Dissatisfied libido is what all art and literature produces.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's a fool.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's uncomplexed.
Check to see if the gas is off.
Would you like to participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the dish.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, just by chance.
You said it, Tom?
It’s hard to understand self-harm if you’ve never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure is rising.
Tom immediately responded to Mary’s question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Is it possible to use myrtle in meals?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save him, Tom.
You haven't solved your problems, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom's very angry.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're going to have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take away Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't come back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sport?
Tom, meet your new babysitter.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
It's very cold for me.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Did anyone find someone to take care of the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom nodded aloud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Are you going to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
That would be good.
It's fast enough on foot.
Tom's very rude.
That's all I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan pulled Linda out safely.
They're my cousins.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom made for me.
I've seen him in person.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems annoyed.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where they are not.

Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my hand lantern.
Looks very well-written.
That was the whole point.
Tom's probably still in school.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
You're below his level.
My goal is to be early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom may have hired Mary, but I'm not sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to persuade Mary to accept the job.
How many percent of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please, help me wait for Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay longer than five minutes.
If the time went by, the radioactivity would decrease.
Do we have to believe that?
What have you been up to?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was trapped in a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What's your plan?
Why are you so mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
Excuse me for coming in like this.
The books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
I transported him.
That gave me an idea.
The spring of the watch is broken.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, all of you.
This is a good place to park.
I'm going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
The kids need love.
It's his business.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe that anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to guard the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabs a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sledding.
You dare to sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they're paying pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Oh, look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The pear is green.
Tom regretted what he said to Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom grunted.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom, you've shaved your hair.
They're all seated.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like walking.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate the school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to get started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
Prohibited speaking during the test, folks.
You had to.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a signal?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They won't come tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Let's go!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to have breakfast in bed.
Dan is walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
It's very close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited, everyone has their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom began to talk.
I've been running away for an hour.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it would be hard for me to catch fish.
Tom was asleep.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I hated you before.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs the two of you to help him.
I'll tell him to go right away.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as the abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a harsh critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball at the gym.
Get back to them.
I'll let you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swimming, because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted the situation to be cleared up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom's got a fight.
Please repeat it.
You're very dramatic.
Tom licked.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
They say that Maria Antonieta was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's tough.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We've been working hard.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook something for you.
You're too busy.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would have liked that.
She runs out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Do we dare to come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite increases.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a wizard.

I completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't go out and look at us through the lock.
The tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That pillar isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They talked quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We have to go back.
That's what I mean.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom has a little cock.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much it costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Oh, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were chasing you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You're a good cook.
There is no shorter way to the top, only to the bottom.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom gets paid a lot.
It was pathetic.
Looks like you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automotive vehicles are now in circulation.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The man was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a crayon.
I like the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave a plush rabbit to his daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I called the clock.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the gait?
You picked her up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you my own, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn’t really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a tribute to me spending the evening with a smart, bright and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got out of control of her parents.
Tom's a spoiler.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
The census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
She took off her clothes to bathe.
A river of sweat began to flow over my face.
Mary gave up moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just fight that.
I'm being taught math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you?
The movies are great entertainment.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
You made me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests can we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might come back.
Thunders out, I'm terrified.
The whole board is against it.
The world is illuminating the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut off my finger.
What did I do with that booklet?
It didn't get so bad.
The plug doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom likes milk.
I gave her a fake address.
I'm done.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you're panicking.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
They started to shoot.
Tom's hooked.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you invent that, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommends Mary.
Who were they?
Tom began to talk.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
He eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom's gone without me.
It's all quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a completely new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were lower than you.
I have to tighten my belt.
Tom nearly clashed with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I know how to ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks good.
Has anyone broken your heart? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
That's how I feel, too.
What's bothering you?
We want to see Tom.
Where did Tom go?
Who won the award?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a lesser attitude towards nudity.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's sleeping.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with mustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I've never been lucky.
His body was dressed in brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I'm so mad at Tom.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always loved more mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the deal with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American poets.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom Crash will never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the distant mountain.
I've missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's so fucked up.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started to talk.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beaten up.
No one is going to bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He used to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom was diagnosed with malaria when he traveled to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything in there?
Tom's passport's expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
Why did you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Can he do anything he wants to do?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I had planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is not yet fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
Apparently you already know the answer.
Could you take us out?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come to save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We got fucked.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was tingly brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never look for my handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I got some donuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't let me look at you.
It was too late.
I live downstairs.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship with him.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's inquisitiveness.
We have to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him a little alone.
I've never worn suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is mostly made up of the poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's awful.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon riding on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People are constantly dying.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He pulled out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom reluctantly left.
Tom seems a little depressed in the morning.
No one understands me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom punched the donkey.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed down.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back, I need it again.
Marko thinks he writes well.
Tom looked.
My ears are roaring.
I take the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very tidy.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a jerk!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's uncomplexed.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were sweeping.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was awful.
Tom seems to be upset.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find some help in the nearest village.
I hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're forgetting.
He worked in the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's from work.
We'll make it.
Praise encourages students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the door of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll fix that.
I can make a deal for you.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measured the weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for nobles.
He has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak on your own behalf.
Do you believe that?
How to choose only one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger immersed deep in the heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licks the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You nearly missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your child's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us at war.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunderstorms?
Do not confuse work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy at work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't make Tom mad.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for her help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly true.
The rats are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw it, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was riding in the back seat.
The bank lent a million dollars to the company.
I've got a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me while I talk.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive alone.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, my head's up, I'm really resentful.
Tom was having fun.
Tom said he didn't know the guy's name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
He asked for a sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I said my own.
You're ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut off his nose.
When do I see you?
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is single.
The woman calls him her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had so much more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm terrified.
Dan's gonna be mad.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not ringing them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I've got a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
You exaggerated her!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What's your taste?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling that the show will be cancelled; they didn't sell a lot of tickets.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go write your homework.
Do not force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
My goal is to read books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems silly.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it’s raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm thankful.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're awful.
Where does he even live? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary is a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom is on a business trip.
Tom said he'd swallow the belly button.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunderstorms.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little fever.
Tom cornered him on the ground.
The lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn’t want to flirt with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while you're riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you're still not sleeping?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He is incapable of doing that.
He didn’t have the courage to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the garbage.
We've both seen him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you paint a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend again.
Just do this job.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Is the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she holds her head reminds me of Maria.
Don't bother my way.
Here we are now looking for them.
My shoes are drenched.
Tom would have retaliated.
She's always worth it.
Which country are you a citizen of?
Trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm going to meet Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the dad.
You know what I need.
You can't stand the heat.
The two of them seem to have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't allow that.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You were brave, weren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling out to John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits for long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll beat you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her back?
A little louder.
The forest was quiet at that time.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's a little more tea in the kettle.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise annoyed me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm just too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto does not belong to anyone.
She knows how to handle a saw.
Turn it off.
I don’t share my real name on any website.
They beat the plan.
I don't want to lie.
“Time is not money, time is life.”
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been coming back for about a week.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a vrypop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk. Let him talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the ceiling.
Her face was tortured with sperm.
Tom is fair.
You have to do this first.
We met around noon.
I'm not doing anything tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you've won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything about you.
Tom tries to become a teacher.
I wish you a beautiful week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom got upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what's started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaikh pierced the tyre.
We made a tree.
This is so much better.
I'm gonna make her cut your lawn.
Tom's good for math.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're Brooke.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and strawberries.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They filled the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't dispute that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for that.
It still doesn't work.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me back.
Was he honest?
The filigree was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire has come back to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in jeopardy.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you back.
Is it true?
I know you're mad.
When I arrived in the morning, Tom was still wearing his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I don’t have enough money right now.
“Are you a vegetarian?” “No, and you?”
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get back in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good in his profession.
I figured it all out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom arranged all of this.
I'm not going to betray her.
Flowers are attracted to bees.
The water is shallow.
There was no plant life in this area.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom’s answer?
You'll do as I tell you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not trained on that.
She's got tight hips.
I don't ovulate.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The poet and the critic travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it breaks all the rules.
What the hell are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line waiting for you.
Men and women are men of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound spilled pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn’t resist.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you look for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers at the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't quite agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is the moral choice of the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language that produced them.
You're nasty.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Check it out.
Give me the french key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I will continue to work here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knows where she put Mary's key.
There was a huge crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked at Mary deeply in her eyes and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right. It's all right.
The stars are shining.
Oh, really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could have done better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You should have found them.
I couldn't sleep over.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're skiing.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary was going to like John.
Tom's a freak.
I just cut my finger.
I'm going to ask Tom.
I have a headache.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Maybe someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powdered medicine.
We were walking along the shore.
I don't want you harassing them.
It depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike quit drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was watching you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're too cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a pleasure for her to meet her great-granddaughter.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom blurted out.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started syringing.
I'm good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have fun as much as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak on your own behalf.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think they're fit for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold back.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer got stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so the conscience really makes us all cowards.
No need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don’t expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take off his pants.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's good to see you.
Now you can leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become one of my favorite subjects.
Things happened very quickly.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up in the morning, we were faced with terrible news.

Wipe your eyes.
Mary's scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't have touched anything.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to enjoy it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a candy with menthol?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself off.
That's where I'm going down.
We're paranoid.
This is not silver.
A blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy that's easy to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She likes to run.
I need a nutmeg.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures on the pavement with chalk.
You're wondering why you've been holding on so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening to something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often doesn’t seem to understand what’s going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this all about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to boast of the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
She swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came in.
You're not tracking.
Do you think you can stop me?
In fact, it's very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Didn't I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's calculating with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary opened the lipstick.
Guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what you said.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I searched everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as they're apart.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock down the wall!
Tom seems stunned.
Tom's got it.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good about retirement.
Thanks for the question.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start to eat?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you joking about?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are these my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved before.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
There's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll come by subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you watch?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think of us?
Do you write the proverbs?
It was a great series.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was on Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just Paki's doing it to me.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom is furious.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom told us to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satiate my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
TV is boring nowadays.
Oh, that's great!
Tom found a clover with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking. She quit smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We stood up to say goodbye to them.
You didn't smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing and nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds very valid.
It's the law!
The water permeates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write that down.
Tom has arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any complaints from customers.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of sparks flying from the fireplace.
It's just fiction.
Tom kept Mary's mouth shut all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I've been dreaming about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam that's coming up.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in his mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these medicines for my dad.
The kids love cakes.
He was quite restrained.
I can get out of here with Tom.
Tom gets annoyed.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted that he had to lie.
Mary collected Tom's money.
Enough with the nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
He has always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom began to crouch.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as difficult as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have it all.
I baked his biscuits.
When does the school year end?
You were right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "goodbye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These are probably fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively, but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend weakened.
Tom and I are done.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom woke up screaming from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak eye.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it done?
We all want lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom opened his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open it.
Put on your apron.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is he still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisers about what items to take.
I have already written everything that needs to be written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I've never changed my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll carry you.
I hired Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom knows how to be very revengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like that before.
You're so daring.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask me on Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back with him.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
This responsibility is a burden on him.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was awe-inspiring.
I don't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems to be jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one up there.
Stop! Stop!
You want some cheese?
I'll call her.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means shrewd.
That was very negligent by Tom.
It's a hole.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them cut you out.
Sequencing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay them well.
Tom's probably gone.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inwards.
You are both heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with or without you.
For now, let's say you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That's disappointing.
Don't talk about us.
It is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom's an invertebrate.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You missed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm in charge.
Tom hit Mary on the head with that pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I'm always mixing these two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very slickly written.
You need to help them.
Tom wasn't crying.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the hook.
I hope this is good.
If they were lying about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
There is nothing worse than stupidity and indifference.
They're all making fun of them.
Tom didn't protest.
What do websites stand out from?
Vampires live forever.
Both of them smiled.
What's in your hand?
She is a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate eggplant.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day cleaning the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon he will not be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
How far is Boston?
They pay me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I've been dismissed.
I asked Tom if he could make it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later in the afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cap out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the fireplace.
The dove symbolizes peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of humanity.
Did she really stay at home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm falling asleep.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid Smoking Excessively.
Tom's a freezer.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing computer games.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking for them everywhere.
I really liked your website.
I'll get you.
Push the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom's breaking up the car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We're gonna do something.
I think Tom's tough.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
Bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sounded reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
Lots of trees have collapsed.
The lions don't know the colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed that Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without the help of Tom.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I'm guessing we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom's acting polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm inferior to you.
I'll quote a paragraph from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that his wallet was gone.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why Do Cows Survive?
My right ear is tingling with pus.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he doesn't speak French.
They don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
What couldn't you sleep on last night?
They cursed us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very well.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk to me later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I can see it.
Did you get here in a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over for us.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You're weakening me.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for welcoming me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer the eggs from the potology.
Can you explain that to me?
Where's his house?
Love is for madmen.
Why would you help him?
Tom lights up his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why Does Everyone Hate Us?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I bothering you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Watch how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna get a lot of bands out of that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Dare I serve you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm chasing.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's licking the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one is talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you already paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What do I get from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It burns me when I'm wearing that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They trusted her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but not the button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom put me down.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm going out to eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I drew the word "Alice" to highlight it.
The third luck.
We've got to take it.
This is an airy dough is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for virtues and give up our vices.
You're smart.
I'm against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I'll never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports for writing.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just hitting you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most unpleasant times.
The dog stared at me like he wanted to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin and they were not real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom mean?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies from time to time.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I think about it all day.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote another check to Linda.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monstrous building.
Tom was not disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She's got ears like a raft.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn’t really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like how that sounds.
That should be possible.
I am a social worker.
Let me try it.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I'm assuming you've read my report.
Tom withdrew.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
He accidented Tom.
Warm it up.
Tom seemed to be annoyed.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Remember you didn't fall for it.
"I got nine on the chemistry test. What about you?" "The same thing."

Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was handsome.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's just me.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't feel good when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your wheel dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's go to lunch.
Looks like I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
Titles should attract the readers’ attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I watched a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
He is full of self-confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that the child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at the wedding.
Who would you choose, Tom?
The hospital isn't that big.
Most people have to work to sustain themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't bark at their dog.
I didn't sleep well.
I love freedom, I don't want to and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of ten to eleven, and boys at the age of eleven to twelve.

A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.

She was dressed.
Epten was cheap.

Was the door locked?
I have a big yacht.
Why can't you come?

Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag yourself when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half of the species is female.
They stare at him.
It's for them.
It's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially useful job to make up for everything I've done.
Tom tied his ribbons.
Are you afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don’t understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence can be interpreted in a number of different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.

Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.

Is Mary liked by Tom?
I've been waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows Bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have a drink?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this topic.
Tom was amused.
Do you know the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I'm still respecting Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had prepared a speech.
Falcons have a sharp appearance.
I wrote it to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was trumpeting.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
The kettle is pretty dirty.
You need to get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off the bag.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.

Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom's unnecessarily giggling.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not taking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts so badly here.
I hate the carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom is never going to finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get her.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom is interchangeable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's kidding him.
Faith implies hope in what the mind cannot hope for.

We rented a movie.
The smell is coming back.

I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling back.
We appreciate our customers. We appreciate our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked for their salary to be increased.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake triggered the fires.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I'd love to have lunch with you.
What the hell do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Throw your guns down.
And tomorrow we'll see you?
I'm the one you love.
We bought those books for them.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's kind of greasy.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
You got it?
My day was full of activities.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad has the flu.
I haven't waited very long.
Just look at yourself.
This is so beautiful.
It is empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The shop is closed.
They listened.
Tom came out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom is furious.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They dismantled it.
Tom's a big dick.
Dare I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He climbed like an eagle.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I'm teaching Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go get Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you some of the money I have.
Tom wants me to give him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take the mask off.
It's definitely an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm bluffing.
I liked the way you danced.
I need you a little.
They lied to us.
Tom's the one.
Tom seems frightened.
The police will investigate the case.
Now get him out of here.
It's white.
Sit down.
Iron is harder than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
I'm being bullied by condors.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to go home on foot in the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he has no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.

Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I applauded.
It's made me feel better.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How do I find him?
The ice has melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
It must have been so easy for you.
I've never been caught.
I love my homeland.
I haven't learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't cheer me up.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer the question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is poor.
They look in the mirror.
I don't feel like crying.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks very tasty.
I need to understand.
The two of you sneered at me!
I've never worn a sleeping bag in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
Tom tried it all.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about, guys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed that Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're ripping off.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It probably won't be worth the wait.
I have to buy a new queue for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
Today it is sunny, but also cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary left us from day one.
Come on, let's go.
The girls are running and playing.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Will you not eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off the bag.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her waist.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom snuck up on Mary.
I'm gonna go look for them.

Haven't I told you already?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.

Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10-a-week pocket.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you been working for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom speaks French.
Tom's got me screwed.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's convenient to wipe it with a elbow, isn't it?

When does it start?

Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's how I suspected it.
Tom doesn't do what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.

You need to buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do afterwards?
Watch out for Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'll laugh first.
Tom is now thirty years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a grandmother just a few days before she turned ninety-nine.
Did you look everywhere?
It is important to keep in mind that no one is ever one hundred percent.
He gestured as he spoke.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.

What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a cock?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She wants to become an actress.
My plastic bottle's broken.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're refined.

The cloud is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions about them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there and remained silent.
I'm collecting postage stamps.
We'll be in Boston tomorrow at this time.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a bracket.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom's a forgery business.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.

You're free to wait here.
I got five in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.

I don't want to get Tom involved in this.
It's nothing scary.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
You're still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to dress up this year?
I'll do as you like.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's locked.

How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom handed it over to Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He lays out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're pushing me a lot.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You haven't asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky is brightened.
It will wake up the baby.
Just look straight.

I've made my decision.
Take care of our planet.

I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and a donut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I'm gonna make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
The two of them smiled again.
The wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt very strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Do you study outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom is in danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Did you write in a diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do this alone?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him back.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll do my best to get there on time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're up and down.
Tom has a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I can't.
Tom’s books have been translated into many languages.
He doesn't like me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the hat off.
I helped him open the table.
I ate a snickerdoodle with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go up a ladder.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is nasty.
I'm sorry I said something to them.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom popped.
I slept in the room.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could very well work.
Don't you feel cold on short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any real Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her back?
We baked cakes for them.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked cookies for you.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a pity.
Too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save the bell.
You've got me on my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems overwhelmed.
Your fun continues with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you'll be able to get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
Demec, do I need to know you?
Tom skillfully concealed all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I guess that's all right.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just broke up Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell the dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's been no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what's this?
Tom's an asshole.
We despise her.
He's in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent the new moss he had just bought to the table.
Tom is going to help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's a smoker.
The landscape is exquisite.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to restrain myself.
Autumn has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic? No.
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so majestic.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should relate to each other in the spirit of universal human belonging.
What happened was an accidental accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do it all by himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom continued practicing.
Try to figure it out.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom stared into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend? Don't you see how poor I am?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous of her.
I offered him to blow his cock, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're an insightful man.
Everything seemed to be okay.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My husband and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
I'm kind of flattered.
Exercise.
She may have lied to you, but I'm not here!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They got me.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a cabbage.
It is easy to solve this task.
They've got to remove the bullet that's stuck to his spine.
It's a lot of fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
Looks like you don't know how much it hurts to have salmon thrown at you.
We're importing grain from the United States.
This is how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan before.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I don't think it's a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother's coming in tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are Potatoes Caloric?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him a make-up.
I was waiting for her outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a stone at me.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee. I like your coffee.
They all doubted.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there is a movie called "The Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Isn't Tom still able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'll pay.
How many more days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Rats are pestilence transmitters.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom apologized.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write so well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
We've been hugged.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's all right.
Tom seems worried about it.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How to use the camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French quite well.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, I don't speak German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Have you finished the packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too worried about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't borrow this book from you.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here too early?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom tied his laces.
I can't put it out.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's unreasonable.
Women in the United States have no right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart? No.
Is that all the excitement?
Tom's wandering off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm bell rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom lay on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It is an undeniable fact.
Is it delicious?
Careful!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's a little blunt.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
He surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellín.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck! <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
I might not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the parapet.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was very thoughtful.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't want puzzles.
This book will help you write well.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
- Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, blow up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary in the morning.
I toasted my toasts with honey the next morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick up strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not ridiculous.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making cake.
Look at the countdown.
I was impressed with your design.
You told me to call you anytime.
What is that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it all off.
Tom suffocated.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to take the kilt.
That's what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I love the foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What is the benefit of this?
I am with the person I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a wonderful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick phrase.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
They all have to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom's not good for sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt that he needed to be redeemed.
This message is for them.
When will I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not flat for you.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He grabbed the dog with a stone.
Tom stared steadily.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try it.
Demek wrote this book himself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be presumptuous.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were happy.
How can we help?
In order to prepare the soil for planting, you have to deplete it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
Nobody's listening to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
Now I'm ready for him.
That's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
I got my pants off.
I asked him what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I agreed.
Tom admits he spilled the red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Loire's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to preserve it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff's here.
Stay as much as your soul wants.
Just grab my arm.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How Many Stomachs Do I Make Every Day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come over here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You have a lot of penetrating eyes.
Isn't that implicit?
He seemed tired to me.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let's go and get in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems to be more confident.
Do you want to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four corners.
I kept working.
It develops dependence.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those ones?
Give them a second.
They sat down and remained silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary stumbled upon her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mission.
Tom wiped the knife knife off his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them turned to me.
I can arrange that to happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gave me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far have you gone?
My dad's very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain how this is possible.
He looked at me through his glasses.
Linda told Dan he'd dumped her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave quite.
I need to get rid of us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came through my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression in several periods of his life.
Shall I take your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What have you got to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is awesome.
There were footprints of penguins in the sand.
Tom's just gone.
Dan called for a tow truck.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you've made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll keep an eye on him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move, move.
I don't speak fast.
We need to talk in front of our eyes.
Tom's not excited.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was eating something.
She's studying English.
With such a lush dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We are going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit out the chewing gum.
Let it be my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommends that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to behave strangely.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always misunderstand me.
We're as strong as you.
The president looked very strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were better at chess than I am.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tight-knit.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's up, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer is careful.
Tom often runs away for hours.
Now is the time for compensation.
Most virgins have a whole hymn.
You can come out at the end.
Why did you just fried two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited for the rain for a long time.
You'll be fine.
Does she have a dog?
I'm resting.
Mary wore fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to something like this.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture. The speaker should have spoken slower.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are drenched.
The medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please, accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother is an American.
Just relax a little.
Is he funny, Tom?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to revolve around him.
We need your help to find her.
The bread is moulded, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fushersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed annoyed.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's up to me, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working well.
Tom got very sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom's just been knocked out.
I prefer goat cheese to cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everyone having fun?
I was up all night.
I have an unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know he's with you.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.

That's not how it happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom immediately listened.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.

I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.

It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.

How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have a job to do.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
He enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-wingers.
Should I take pictures with or without flashes?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was on.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom is in Australia.

They are too busy fighting against each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?

Let's do it now and it's over.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a traffic jam, but you're gonna be okay.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?

Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I really like you guys.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't believe I bought this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom apparently was here earlier in the morning.
Get up, you lazy man!
How long ago was that?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This sofa is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let’s continue the conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.

This orange is very tasty.

Take it off.
Is it resolved already?

Does anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come back tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
It's my fault.
The dog should be on a chain.
I'd rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to go to bed and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital recovering from an overdose.
He cracked the walnut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were getting ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem to be busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's a face.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is suspicious.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup up.
That's a good training.
The capital is unique.
I should have refused.
I had to think about what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I've been living here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my limb.
I know you've done your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the cover of the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know both of them.
I should feel sorry for them.
I'm not snooping.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried about it.
I am not commenting on their articles.
You will be my guests.
Watching TV is a lot of fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is really top.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom is exaggerating.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was irresistible.
I agree with the plan.
Righteousness is expressed in deeds.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America, you're supposed to leave a tip to the waiter.
That kind of behavior was childish on his part.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you can still.
Tom was a little awkward about Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the cars.
They kidnapped me.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is very tasty.
We're on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very strict with himself.
She's a bug.
The lemonade's cold.
The lantern was moving back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom is a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Mary that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you catch a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'll be right there.
I was half asleep.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is so much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's going to wander.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something threw me away.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of Tom.
They seem familiar to me.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in the fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get some sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, didn't you?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new to this town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in an enclosed room.
It was a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're overwhelmed with worries.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried about it.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom's great.
I suspect that Tom broke the window.
Tom approached.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is compassionate.
Let's be brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was any way he could help.
We could've gotten along.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom runs to the roof.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than it was yesterday.
It must have been created from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, football field and billiard table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was teasing his sister.
We should have given up earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing that?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom let go of the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't kneel.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I won't forget.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher's.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genera in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's in bed talking on the phone.
These are wonderful ones.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need pride to pass them on.
The noise stirred up the whole city.
Anyone who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you hand over the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Do you write messages to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom was knocking.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears attacking clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem, this is mine.
Before I went to bed, I drank three cold pills.
It's possible that Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom behaves like a spoiled owl.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
You like movies?
Time is eternal.
First, you have no right to draw conclusions. Second, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I grow cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you later.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom take part?
The thief turned into a cop.
We're gonna let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could have helped you more.
Tom can't be seen anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I passed by it in a car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do it without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
He works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the theme.
I'll be back in a little while.
She looked as if she was deeply disturbed by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser throws out a jet of boiling water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom continued to pack.
I don't have a home I can go back to.
I'm here at will.
It's to protect you.
Someone has always helped me.
They don't like that.
Tom takes over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It can be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First and foremost, be kind to older people.
Gemstones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to get permission from your mother beforehand.
I'll take Tom's place.
What made you want to come to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're looking for chickens a lot.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I ate lunch quickly.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I have learned, French was the easiest.
Tom wrote a homework.
I counted to 200.
Take care of this.
Shall I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a pity?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom. Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Explain your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I've got homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Is it possible to get there by car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom has a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I screwed up something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom's always been poor.
It's a beautiful elbow.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom got upset with Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a lot of money from her.
Can you help me deal with that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spiders.
You really talk a lot.
It could be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom doesn’t always have to believe what the other person says.
He is in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's eldest daughter is unmarried.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a painkiller.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're upset!
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I’m going to do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's manuscript.
I think it's helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do everything.
Soon the sound stopped.
Who shaved you?
I don't really understand myself.
Tom is a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How'd Tom get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't take off.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
You're welcome.
Peter might need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom likes to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your scoundrel.
What's our condition?
You want me to keep it?
You're a real manhattan.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who is Responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
Nobody's talking.
What do you think about contacting them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated differently than before.
He should be fine.
I followed the rules.
Tom is a widower.
I think Tom's soulless.
I haven’t seen that movie yet.
You've already done it.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old papers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who laughs, but not who cries.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He enjoys listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
It was a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My feet are still hurting.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I fainted.
It's hard to assess his abilities.
That's good.
I know a man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I am open to everything.
I used to protect you.
Stand where they are.
Are you her cheater?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cuts it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The nurse gave her an influenza injection.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty silly.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a cliff while he was cleaning his clogs.
You got anything to add, Tom?
Shut up, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help it.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
They all laughed.
Did Tom look happy? No.
Who wrote the letters?
Tom's making a bow.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was caused by me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
Nothing looks more like a madman than a drunkard.
Take it, Tom.
Tom began to get undressed.
I know Tom suffers.
It looks good.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate with all this noise.
Share the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
I'd like to serve you dinner.
Can't that wait?
They'll pay for their arrogance.
Dan didn't miss a single episode of that soap.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can find you some help.
I heard him.
We're examining the whole area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me he'd like me to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'll be missed by everyone.
That's where we'll be.
Why do they do that?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was only ash left.
Tom likes all sorts of vegetables except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their company.
Those who confuse the verb endings "-<0xC5><0x9B><0xC4><0xAB>t" and "-<0xC5><0x9B><0xC4><0xAB>t" have a special place in hell.
What happened next?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
I didn't count on that.
I was unconscious.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom welded two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom made a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences throughout the month.
That was awful.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really nasty.
You want cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all of her money.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is chaste and pious.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I'll be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's doing a good job with his car.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people of the earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm not.
I'm having fun.
We've all got to go find Tom.
I'm tidy.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the grocery store.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it myself.
What's that?
Can people really be so silly to think that the entire population of Georgia, who speaks a Caucasian language that has neither common phonemes nor common letters with English, can completely master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There's too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the madman.
They laughed at Tom.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Each student has his or her own closet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work on the weekends?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom is studying farming.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that beautiful sound?
This isn’t Tom’s first time.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took the flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him in the mess.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You're borrowing books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary is.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not a musician, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They play volleyball.
When did you buy it from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned a lesson in the hard way.
You showed them the fakes of my friends.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat is on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What kind of books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm full.
He ate a salad of cabbage.
I'm going to run.
Tom chews something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom had never visited Boston before.
It's good to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and take a look.
Do you think you like it?
Innocence is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's heart rate is up.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept robbing her boyfriend of how kind, compassionate, courageous he was, and I still don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom believes in Mary.
You were busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I've been embarrassed by heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't stand it for long.
Reward yourself as a reward.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom nodded silently.
They're not gonna help you.
I'm feeling great.
They're not there.
I'm not doing anything right.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
It seems very sleepy.
I made a mushroom biscuit yesterday.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a prize?
Believe in the science!
Although the worm possesses both male and female reproductive systems, it needs another individual to fertilize.
Failure embarrassed Lisa.
I heard that Tom got sick.
Tom fainted.
Don't smoke here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm going over there right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
It is assumed that the surface temperature of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd went crazy.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy him a birthday present for John.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is freshly baked from the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to examine him.
That was a disgrace.
I need Tom's address.
It's kind of sad.
I just didn't believe her.
It's possible Tom's gone.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom refused it.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly 10 o'clock.
I told you my dad died when I was thirteen.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom was not thrilled.
That was pretty bad.
This must be yours.
We're just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left fingerprints in the liquid cement.
A knight would never do such a thing.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't pretend to be Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant.
Tom has never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold.
Fortunately, the hut is stable, otherwise the storm would have easily destroyed it last night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's got a record somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'm gonna give up.
Mary’s eyes were filled with joy.
It's a bad thing to gossip.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd really like a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of being a dancer.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's acting mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I talking about?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated on him.
Everything is in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at 10:00?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple thing.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I’m looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
It seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn’t even know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was an honor to be asked to give a speech.
Tom's not for the sport.
I'm stunned, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Tell your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I really want to try new things.
He was not the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We're in a hurry.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom got me a cab.
He did miracles.
The glands secrete chemicals into the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom is resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I was giving her help.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why do rabbits have large ears?
Come here! Come here!
You could have refused.
Why don't you let me help?
It's gonna happen soon.
Hey, it's suffocating here, get me out of here before I suffocate.
It will happen what will happen.
I've heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom alone there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to do with Dan's robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers came from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom behaved decently.
I guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay, whatever you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak louder?
Where will the meeting be?
Let’s play “Truth or Challenge.”
His findings are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started leafing out the book.
That's the right reason.
Tom loves flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
You know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How much time do you spend in front of the computer?
My wife is exhausted from her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amoebics are single-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You're crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is more durable.
I'm cold.
He went before me.
Give me that back.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday. I'm sorry.
This is not fair to me.
Maybe someone was following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a box.
Unless I met her.
They were smiling.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the lights.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like more bread?
This won't work.
She's just gone.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed to be okay.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive mother.
An international language would be of great benefit to humankind.
I was giving them help.
Have you already decided?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave the baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's kind-hearted.
What time is it?
It's a nice weekend.
Do you want carbonated water?
Tom nodded to the girls.
We had a terrible fight.
Tom seems different nowadays.
Throw them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in the monasteries.
Don't be so perverted!
Tom wants evidence.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your paycheck.
Excuse me, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom has small fists.
You're worrying me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom's a money launderer.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you could swim?
Don't put pressure on Tom.
They betrayed me.
And there's no paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Come to the meeting.
I'm gonna find a picture of you giving the speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb creampies, potatoes, and mushroom soup for dinner.
We've been waiting outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier like this.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask any questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke rises in the air.
The printer is not working.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom is annoying.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the game.
Tom doesn't want a party.
Looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm single.
We don't want new accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have great resistance to getting up early, even when it is necessary.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be familiar with oils and lubricants for motors.
How was yesterday?
You have to learn valuable.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelette.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got it, didn't they?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running up to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I folded it.
Tom remained calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living beings.
They're entertaining her.
I need to go change my clothes.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Our grandmother died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
He has no appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he didn't know how to swim.
Tom quickly got lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a beacon.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you blink when we kiss?
Somebody's gonna see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that? I don't know.
I misjudged her.
It'll be over in a little while.
I didn't say I agree.
Did you know my dad?
Tom was preparing to shoot me.
Tom Orchid.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her a little privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
God created the seed.
It's not too early.
Am I allowed to eat?
They painted the frames of the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I screwed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Did Mike quit drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly on the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
An hour before the event.
You've been amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird picked up the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same guy three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to set aside some time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to get rid of it.
What am I gonna be to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
This is not a good time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
Tom runs past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
Epten is strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
My conscience bites me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's been drunk on tequila.
My grandmother is deaf, in other words, a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're pretty bragging.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
There's something going on with Tom.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I give you my respect.
Be merciful.
Let's keep an eye on the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go get dressed.
Tom was really mad.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
- Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb up.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
He lied to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to laugh.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
We'd just get in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her out.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found a secluded beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like Oxygen.
They're up to you for now.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself last night.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He's been framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We are all eager to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt one at a time.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, okay?
Dinner was so good!
Take control of yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm messing around.
Tom took off his hat and bowed down.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
He drinks three to six cups of coffee a day.
Tom nodded aloud.
It was Beth.
Tom started to squeeze.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by tomorrow.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was insane.
The can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein considered himself to be a philosopher.
The steam's blurred my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the lead flag?
Relax! Relax!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom has been without food for a week.
I don't understand you.
Although I'm a devout man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can we have a word?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does the same thing as Mary does.
We need to examine something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your tits?
He drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said something?
Tom began to say something, but Mary kept him quiet.
We met at the exchange.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York City.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not signed up.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I'm wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't gnaw.
Tom was awake.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't make me faint.
Tom wasn't home when I nailed it.
I still don't understand.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, let's go.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We left at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of a different dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for that yet.
Each member must be present.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must've jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you know his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me pass on a message to Tom.
Where's my bag of golf gear?
Please read these instructions. . .
We're not criminals.
The flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're fair.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You seem familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy gifts?
You two are so cute together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What is Happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
He squeezed his key bone while he was playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was rude.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please notify them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I wanted to cook something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop along the way.
I heard Tom crying.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be nervous about that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's insane.
Let's go again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
No need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
The penguin is very sweet.
You're such a stray.
We are sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look awkward.
I could make things easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave the house in slippers.
I think Tom's a zip-locker.
Pain from a terrible infection and the ovary and leaked.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't come into consideration.
Tom headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
Sometimes he behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
This is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a second.
I got a list from her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cappuccino cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the theme.
She really wants to talk.
I've got questions for Tony.
This is an interesting, funny and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
That's it.
This is the Holy Land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just stop talking.
It's my birthday in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the cup.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's an ungodly.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we calmed down.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shivering in it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm ringing her.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people does he gather in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven’t called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little overwhelmed.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
Neither here nor there.
The phone numbers are fascinating.
You don't have to be defensive.
This is the best pizza in town.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
