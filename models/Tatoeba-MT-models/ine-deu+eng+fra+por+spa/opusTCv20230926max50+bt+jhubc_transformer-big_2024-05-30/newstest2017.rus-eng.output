28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairway through a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine someone wanting to hurt him, noting, “Finally, things were going well for him.”
"The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia," the San Francisco Forensic Medical Examination Bureau said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a past Boston delivery line cook, got his dream job as a cook at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and he will be greatly missed," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galizia said Frank first stayed at the hostels, but recently "he's finally done fine."
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine someone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good soul.
His way of connecting with the family has always been to prepare us some dish, to prepare us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in a fight.
He was a brother who sailed along the river.
“With all the bad things happening to this world, it was that untapped diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has the information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystals of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in shark longevity, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals is the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest is necessary for us not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get recommendations from a doctor on how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, you should not waver from it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Around 90% of visitors experience stress.
People from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are most susceptible to it.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend the holidays with your children, you don’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests and treatments.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalation, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic exercise.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account individual indications and features of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for infants and provide services of experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round holiday at the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main chip of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various systems of the body.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
Essentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki nova" has an anti-inflammatory, bile and diuretic effect.
The same effects have "Slavyanovskaya" water.
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because salts retain fluid, which leads to increased pressure.
Reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tamboukan, from which dirt is useful for the joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, absorbent, immunomodulatory effect.
These are wellness walks on individually formulated routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take baths wine, pearl, yo-doubtable, selenium, saline-lacquer, depending on what your doctor will prescribe.
Prolong the fruiting.
What can I do to keep the harvest to the end of the season?
Yulia Belopukhova, a farmer and daughter-in-law.
High-grown tomatoes it is time to arrange a haircut: to remove new seedlings, cut the stems, remove all the leaves until the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small incisions - will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as pepper and eggplants are fed with ash-superphosphate extract, treated with biopreparations (Recipient - for accelerating the flow and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamoir, Bactophyte - from diseases, Immunocyte -
From chemicals at the end of the summer, it is worth using only copper copper, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
Make the last watering of the plants.
Long-haired cucumbers in the greenhouse are poured from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pour warm water and a solution of Zircon, pour the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruiting of zucchini: cut old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the night cold, install over a bed of rainbows with a cover material.
In the daytime, keep the plants open and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, GDP of the Russian Federation shows positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development also recently announced stabilization of the situation.
There is a slow growth ahead.
According to the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind and ahead is slow economic growth,” the Bank of Russia’s bulletin says.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline in GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally-cleaned decline in GDP amounted to 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15", - quotes the representative of the RIA Novosti.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the bottom has passed.
Among other markers indicating signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, revival of business.
If we make an amendment to the fact that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics in the plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this the lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus-minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index stood at 7.2%, compared with 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the exchange rate of the ruble, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August since the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy", - emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, there has been an increase in the volume of industrial production in Russia.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The slowdown in foreign trade turnover from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive trend is also demonstrated by the situation on the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation on the labour market, the issue of real disposable income of the population is left to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure fell by 4.8 per cent.
This factor can hamper the recovery of the economy, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, as risk factors for economic growth, we can also call the tough policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not best affect the real sector.
A negative factor is also the insufficiently high level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the pace of the decline of the Russian economy will slow to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly absorbed in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-foreigners, then in most cases we are talking about native countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process – quite a large number of Russians are flying the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents took someone to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone did not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports will be created abroad.
"AiF.ru" has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of the 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
She was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to practice athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose the jump with the sixth.
If she remained in Russia, she would hardly have been able to "lift from the throne" Elena Isinbayev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be the only one of our countrymen, albeit a former, in the jumping sector with a sixth.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Much because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children grew up in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to be interested in fighting in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Combat Training Center continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
In the same year, the World Cup was a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win the silver at the 2010 World Cup.
Then came the 2013 bronze and the 2014 silver.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronous swimming.
But to say that it was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
The girl’s family soon decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her work there.
Soon she was already part of the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, on a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Schaldybina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training the girl in artistic gymnastics overseas.
Up to this point, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Immigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the country's youth team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough - she brought out the star-striped team at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former “artist” is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who is for Germany’s national team.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more chances to get to the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Jana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the finals in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time athletic - Irina Sazonova.
If the routes of emigration of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the country’s champion.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - he specially comes to his homeland so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in personal multiplayer.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4<0xC3><0x97>100 complex relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavuurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, a champion of Russia, a master of the sport of Russia of the international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing his nationality.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his homeland than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to practice sports gymnastics.
He has not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualifying on parallel beams.
But for New Zealand, even going to the Olympics in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronous swimming activities, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took the 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroeter is for the Israel national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croiter also won the gold medal at the Singapore Youth Olympics.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitry is engaged in length jumping and triple jumping.
Albert, 31, is another native of Hasavuurt, who after long speeches for Russia has decided to change his sporting citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he represented the School of Higher Sports Skills of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of Yaroslav Antonov, a volleyball player of the USSR.
Literally a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze winner of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hajiyev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and met with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free struggle.
Soon he won the junior world championship and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free struggle, and again a former Russian.
This time it will be about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, - about Tymuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently representing the country's national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to achieve high results in Russia.
He became the bronze winner of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Failing to enter the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sporting citizenship.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, - Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to practice boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Bijarslanov won the gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why are Cossacks in school?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, “the Cossacks need to be educated not with actions and parades, but systematically.”
They must grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But while this work, I think, is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive things that have accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is inflamed and we don’t know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
HKH continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an attack on the funds allocated to the utilities from budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of housing.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid energy workers more than 170 million rubles.
On the other hand, the Prosecutor’s Office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of inclusion of unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (according to puts cold water) were invested 4 million rubles. on renting cars at a price above the market price.
There are a lot of such examples in the country.
The people spend the last money for the "municipal" and pay correctly, according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is immediately charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was actually not carried out, but paid.
Businessmen were just giving him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent them on his needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov’s machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the UK, who were appropriating the money of citizens, went through the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kochan continues, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatka region he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the UK, the other two played the role of settlement and cash centers, i.e. took money from the population.
However, the energetics A. Kochan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, the beloved.
Judging in the field of housing is quite difficult.
Things don't get excited, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvolotneva, Executive Director of the National Bank "ZHKH Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we invent a new one, which should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including among judges, on housing issues.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
The Prosecutor General's Office also talks about refusals to initiate criminal cases, about fiber in the course of investigations.
In 2015, less than half of the 3,500 crimes were brought to justice.
For the rest, the investigation was protracted, and one in five was suspended due to the non-identification of the accused.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the investigating authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeits - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the last five months of the current year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the meeting of tenants?
This means: a change in the management of the house, financial and other issues are circumventing the opinions of the owners.
And this also means that the housing and utilities market can not break through normal companies that want to work honestly, rather than "milk" the population.
It turns out that the tenants in the minus, small and medium-sized businesses, too.
First of all, through the elimination of corruption as such in the whole state, I am sure Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on property issues.
And now this work is actively being done.
It’s not just a single action, it’s a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital of scandals and does not smell.
Why is there no such scandal in the housing sector in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the metropolitan government has shown an iron will and brought order, - said "AiF" Anatoly Vybonnyy, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Countering Corruption.
I mean both the human resources issue, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies are closely supervised and all of them have undergone licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and addresses of residents, and response measures are posted on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many don’t just pay monthly receipts, but watch carefully what it says, how the house is contained.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource-providing and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs on housing and utilities - because a large part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably all this together and explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is it all in the hands of the regional authorities?
Is it possible to change the place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this while addressing his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged Americans to give up their support for the “terrorist organization of Fethullahists.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey’s relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization (FETO).
Either an organized coup by Feto or a democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice,” Erdogan’s address was quoted by the Anatolia Agency as saying Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The president of Turkey once again, but already more strictly demanded from the United States to comply with his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
On the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempted assassination of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan appealed to the population, the uprising was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States denied all claims against it, refusing to issue Gülen and advising him to change the tone.
The last statement of representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s visit to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also makes demands on his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels sets a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkey's EU affairs minister Omer Celik said on Aug. 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendment to the anti-terrorism law, as demanded by the EU, will jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop the EU’s blackmail by promising to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to the corresponding statement of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, assuming that Turkey could leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish foreign ministry did not rule out that the country will consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if it does not receive the expected support from him.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere – they import missiles,” Cavusoglu told the Anadolu news agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results did not satisfy us, and we started looking for others," the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West in terms of business, and in terms of military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance while maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, Americans would be more comfortable to see a fully obedient person in this position," the expert explained to AiF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of EU compensation, the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States) will pressure him.
“Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him precisely on humanitarian issues, on dictatorial methods of managing the country and so on,” he said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexei Mukhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance towards Russia and sought favor in the West in every way.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after some time.
I think Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has entered a period of boat diplomacy.
Being between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stop supporting Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, who use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert said.
Another point of view is the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova.
Turkey’s relations with the EU and the US are now rather tense, and this is primarily due to Erdogan’s internal policies.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and in the context of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, the relationship with Israel is settled, there is an active political interaction with Iran", - explained AiF.ru Glazova, assuming that the next step of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was at this time that Turkey began to actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in a position of 'zero problems with its neighbors'.
There have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's positions both on the regional and international arena," the expert said.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its former relations with the EU, now the question is whether the EU will start responding harshly to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Young Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors have asked the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over the new labor contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
In July, junior doctors and medical students voted to terminate an employment contract agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who took part in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had continued to "persistently remain silent" about issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of expanding collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA’s junior physician leader, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of employment recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to accept during the pre-voting meetings of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a sustained impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked tense, and he barely radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the long-lasting cold coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was unclear.
Mr. Putin burst out with an angry tyranny, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The offense was even stronger, based on an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media have carried out an overwhelming, total offensive on Ankara.
All of a sudden it seemed that the Turks were to be blamed for everything.
The most serious accusations were made by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family exploited the illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of an armistice are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him as well.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard – especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The amount fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relief when the flights are finally resumed.
They put it at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists over there, tomatoes back here," the report said in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to that her prolonged discontent with the turtle-like pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin’s move – which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit at this shining palace on the seacoast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad ones”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and it needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer lending brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be engaged in because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I say now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“Is this a good time for us to move the brand bank, since basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago to say that we are going to be a great bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a Newmarket victory on Addiction
Dettori sprinkles champagne after a double at the Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3000th British victory at the Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second night winner on his home lane – on the Addiction, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Idderry, and Willy Carson.
Three-time Jockey Champion Dettori, who previously won Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, since this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big lay event, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unpretentious.
Dettori takes applause when he brings the predisposition after the victory
Two jockeys have reached such a mark in obstacles races: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical trick that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at the Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he hadn't been just a weekend jockey and big jumps!
And seriously, Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character that’s good for British riding, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a brand-new fast-paced jump from the horse
From swift finishes to swift jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
A number of big-league winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue participating in competitions at least until the age of 50.
Putin fires the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of the administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted close circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a representative for the environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not give the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vino, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Wyno, 44, a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later he was the head of the administration of the protocol of the president and the apparatus of the government, reports the website of the Kremlin (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as heads of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to release him from the position and recommended that Vino replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters for a long time and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, the two men said that the head of the administration had resigned at his own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, this has convinced few here – especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the person who was once campaigned as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, you might say, problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as the third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this position was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
"Think Like a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after wrestling with producer
Gibson was a participant in a show shoot in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative disagreements in the shooting and differences of opinion.
I am sorry that this happened,” he said in his statement.
Details on how Gibson’s character will be removed from the show, which is being watched by a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love ‘Thinking like a criminal’ and have invested my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is set to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banfa asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandstones left behind by water slugs.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a shot of this spectacle to the Periscope in the hope that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project must now be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern passage and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
This is the first of four connections between the "windows of the canvas" that are now approaching completion near all three pillars of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wings of the bridge.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and have been used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the junction between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate tolerances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the total bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas concrete coating is poured in Rosate today, which means that the whole canvas is ready for lifting to a place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “First looping on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this loop is the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the expanding road of the North Pylon, it was then left to close the remaining gap on the north side – or facing the shore.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be lifted at an angle of about 3%.
It’s elegant because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny – just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'lucky to stay alive'
The three men were "lucky to stay alive" after being ejected from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried their best to reach a safe place, while their ship continued on its way.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre rescuer Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man of 60 years was found defeated and trapped in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said: "Three men thrown into the water are fortunate to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the boat had an emergency breaker, but it somehow crawled away from the person driving the boat when it rolled over.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It’s exciting to see the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and more recently smartphones.
It is so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the enthusiasm that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later spawned a series of cartoons, game cards, and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this lost relevance a little before this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked via GPS and, when detected, can be ‘photographed’ (through a screenshot on your phone) or ‘catched’.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the lonely hobby, breaking away from the sofas for search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an “ordinary” person every day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people they tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing the levels.
Many health campaigns convincing people to “find 30 minutes,” “get up from the couch” and “be active every day” have found no response because most health messages are boring and spoken by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and yet a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it draws people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might stumble on the door.
Well, what?
The breakthrough happened.
After all, even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could still track our physical activity in the past, they didn’t give us a reason to practice, as this game does.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Byles wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Bailes is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on a leap.
Unforced on the tree.
Stunning on the floor.
Amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of the absolute championship on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her overall score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate of the "Final Five" Eli Riesman and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Biles from the United States is performing on a gymnastic tree during the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailes became the fourth American woman in a row to win the title of absolute champion and fifth overall, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly anytime.
She cried when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Bailes has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals – including 10 gold – with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Ratton called her “the greatest, most hymnalistic” ever.
One last test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bailes and others in this field, but between it and a load of overwhelming expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family’s home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an unjustified expectation.
Simone Bailes from the United States, left, and Eli Riesman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailes made her first gold medal on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Caroli.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the summit, it wasn’t quite so.
Part of her free-exercise program — one that includes her signature pass — is set on Latin American music that would fit just like home on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a newborn child and opened by the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was the coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single championship since the summer of 2013, a lucky lane that has to last as long as Bailes wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small advantage with the help of two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic logs and free exercises – where Byles defends the title of World Champion – lie in ambush.
She again moved forward with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riesman gently embraced her as they waited for the final score – pure formality – and tears appeared around a shiny red with a white and blue eyeliner for Bailes, when the idea she once recorded in the clipping album came true.
Riceman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago when she shared third place but lost bronze to Mustafina in a tai-break.
This time the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call “grandmother,” was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered with return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bailes, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the deadliest attack on Phoenix's first serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Malia were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked in the driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator made about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, then hid on another vehicle, according to the report.
Police claim that the triple murder is not apparently the result of a robbery, as the intruder did not take the wallet or $2,900 held by one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over the course of four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have taken advantage of several vehicles, including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were interrelated and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and her daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told police there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the sleeves and pulled the bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivotto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
That’s not really true – of course you’re signing up for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical facility.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people would do that yet,’” Pixivto said.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But it’s not just the usual gesture language – she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund’s, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a life-long prognosis because I don’t expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rain expected to fall over the state by Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from shores and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steel, spokesman for the Governor’s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were being received for transport for high-water, boat and sandbags.
Steele said Tanjipahoa's arrival alone requested tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The danger of flooding remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could leak into the area.
In southern Alabama, the standby awaited flooding was in effect until Friday as rain continued to flow in the Mobile area.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Day Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a flood record last weekend.
Synoptician Alec Krautmann said the two rivers could have flooded many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream at the Assenchen parish is a threat as these bloated rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tickfow River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flooding in the counties of Amit and Wilkinson in the southwestern state of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another son-in-law, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the largest inflow she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family have a disability, and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are “spreading rapidly” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rainfall from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from the middle.
Heavy rain and flooding in the streets have led to work to rescue residents from homes in the Tanjipahoa parish and to cancel classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa’s adviser told about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now being flooded.
President Robbie Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals in the high waters.
The shelters were opened in the town of Amit and the town of Hammond to welcome those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede," he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were made available for delivery to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” city manager Lacey Landrum said.
It is on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, said the siege rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tauson, "and it's still flowing on the ground."
6-year-old Mahaz Brown, 'scattered by bullets', remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police reported that a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shot at a six-year-old in the city this week.
His grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and grandpa say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his arm, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was very tired, his little body was shot with bullets," his grandmother told the station's Delores Melendez.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is admitted to the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that it was expected to improve.
He was supposed to go to first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reportedly in critical condition; the other two victims were recorded in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a gunfight between several armed men.
The sleeves of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, have set the scene.
It certainly seems to have been a long battle.
There were sleeves on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly looking at video surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old boy, a girl, was struck in the hand by a crazy bullet Tuesday while playing outside his home in the West Oak Lane area.
She is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gaby and Laurie
This is what I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simona Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Eli Riesman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, at last, like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latino women’s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
That's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed her warmly.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simona Byles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuous gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win the gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And teammate Ellie Riesman earned a silver medal.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's coaching.
But in reality gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs, supported with the help of parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions for participation in competitions, payment of services of hotels and hotels (for coaches and their guides).
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the most out of their workouts, and this is an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simona Bailes, and Maggie Hani, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simona, Gabbi and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young boys (mainly blacks and Latinos) and educated national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive impact on good health, success at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
“Thank you, Simona, Ellie, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women’s Force in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors have taken to announcing further strikes after rejecting the offer of Jeremy Hunt
The ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing a revised contract with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the deal, saying the NHS was on “no one’s land” and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work to improve service in out-of-hours.
Dr Ellen McCott, chair of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Jung doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current labor crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to act and sometimes complete silence on the part of the government.
And that’s despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocally prepared to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April resulted in a delay of about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nursing admissions, while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picketing line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a revised contract with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for the weekend for 54,000 junior doctors who fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “The strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on the already working teams and services at the border, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disruption to patients, nurses and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics such as Healthcare, Personnel Distribution, Educational Flexibility, Additional Education for those who return after a career break, Cost of Education, Mutual Recognition of Curriculum, Academic Leave, and Gender Differences.
Medication for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to take the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-reversal drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Supervisory Service of the UK’s National Health Service has advised to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE Supervisory Service of the UK’s National Health Service has advised to give it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack happens to about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it will be able to move along the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack are experiencing another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor – especially the risk of bleeding – is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
The culture of ownership of the PC allows to thrive the falsification of the count of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, serving as a boost to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to eye-closing, which has resulted in widespread falsification of the count of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been criticized by the police, election watchdogs and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations because of “excessive sensitivity about race and religion.”
A former local community secretary, now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to put boundaries outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to provide their name and address.
The report even suggests applying non-washable ink to people’s fingers when they hand over their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
Better protection for whistleblowers is needed, Sir Eric said.
He urged the press to have greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered on Downing Street following a vote scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court examining election issues ruled that incumbent mayor Luftur Rahman had to be removed from office due to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and forced his critics to remain silent, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or were the result of personification when a person votes in the presence of someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about the fraud of the mail vote, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reportedly pressuring people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
The report states: "Evidence of pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at will, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There were fears that ... government institutions had closed their eyes on such behavior because of excessive sensitivity to ‘political correctness’ regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Eric Cheese has made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with postcards for voting to stop “collection of votes.”
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tightened checks on registration to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is considered.
Use non-washable ink on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic nationality checks to ensure that people have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic mail voting.
Eliminate political campaigners and activists from working with filled out ballot boxes and envelopes with mail votes.
Give the police authority to establish borders around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Illegal photography at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the polling booth one by one.
Sir Eric attacks the city police fiercely, stating that it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The court examining the election disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of substantiated doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the tick” of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s ruling at Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Going mad on the bicycle analogue of Kate and other celebrity doubles at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went mad at French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prévo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics participant isn’t the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous double — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics that have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. men's archers team, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on a bike lane, many people online hastened to point out how a certain archer could have been the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. male archer team, Brady Allison, was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter after images of him appearing terribly similar to the Wall Street wolf star.
In fact, the archer learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on the face,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Razerford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg was compared to the star of Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sporty version" of the actor "Start"
Another longstanding comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medallist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimov can boast not only the same tanned skin and light hair as the actress AnnaLinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to the fans, is similar to the "sports version of Joseph Gorvago".
Rough Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize his enthusiasm that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynn, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful wide-brimmed smile.
Olympic commentator on CBC apologizes for saying that the Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place on the finish line of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on the women's relay freestyle 4x200 m outraged on Wednesday CBC viewers in live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like a stench” and “died like a pig” during a swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final 4x200 m female relay in a freestyle.
One could hear McDonald, who was recruited to the CBC commentator team to “dilute it with color,” say, “This 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started as a scent, died as a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yangan, 14, flew the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC speaker just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’???”
This idiot didn’t realize they were still on the air.”
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately struck Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users couldn’t help but hear how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: ‘Nothing to herself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance being aired."
It was a bad choice of words, we’re sorry it happened.”
The U.S. Air Force ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
Commenter's friend Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald's
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The TV also hastened to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers live and our social media subscribers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments referred to the swimmer's performance, not her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on a person.
“I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on CBC’s Olympics broadcast.
"I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her in person."
"It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman naked to try her panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried what she looked like in them, pulled them up and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkston.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkston, where a woman tried knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson’s mother, who was at the store at the time, said that after testing her underwear, the mysterious woman again “dressed herself and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a pair of panties from the showcase, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find a private place to do it—she was just standing there, shameless.”
“Everyone got up when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing here that she would like, dressed up again and went out.
“She didn’t seem to care who was watching her, or what she thought of the person who would eventually buy the panties she was trying.”
33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent said: "How dare you think someone is going to take home the panties that someone else was already wearing and they weren't washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these garments from the sale after she left — and that’s even better.”
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s panties and find that another woman wore them and took them off, and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our store in Folkston on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question were taken from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using a Cowgirl
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the Cow Mage Federation in New York, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they come to you in front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the thief with his own weapon.
If you approach the back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn around so that you see the attacker and “release the line of fire.”
You then firmly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee in the armpit, and while the attacker bends with pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, punch him in the face with a barrel, and go back, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, suitable front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker with your fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?

But remember that the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not a master cow magician — is to give away your cash.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright spends his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler put his immune system and vomiting reflex to serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Leading and author of travel books, 51-year-old Jan Wright, from Suffolk, conducted a speech on the euro banknote, the Circus Piccadilly rails, a toilet wash button on the train and a Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called "The Guide to the Inner Force of the Traveler-Lizuna," has yielded some amazing results.
The thought of licking the wash button on a train used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip around Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the train stations to the toilet wash button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In a film he made, he said: 'I've been completely careless about my health since childhood and I've pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test sweep demonstrated a luminometer value exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer value was more than 4,000 units, while the just washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have filmed a traveler’s guide to internal strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve smelled in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Traveler’s Guide to Inner Strength was taken together with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company has provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains milky bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, Nico Wuorenmaa, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we have been able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was the director of the film, added: "Let's say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite stiff.
I'm glad that some of these licks we managed to film.
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked the milky-milky bacteria exclusively to a good stomach and intestine condition, and 58 percent said they consumed at least occasionally foods containing added milky-milky bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of the eviction
The family of the bullies left their municipal home with losses of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives discovered the property in a condition requiring repairs.
The walls were left with shimmering holes, the halfways were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and presumably lives in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a resident at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh, because this property is likely to be known as a not-so-good Cornwall aspect.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name enjoys bad fame.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and the police reported that the realm of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, and harassment.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old garbage
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an extended 11-week period for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by the neighbors, who said that their lives had been turned into the essence of hell.
One said, 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived with them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Security team, said the family had been unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and also regularly called the police
The garbage and old toys were scattered below on the crooked side of the municipal house
“It’s a shame that the tenant couldn’t take any responsibility for her and her family’s behavior, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was limitless, and their actions must have been terrifying to her watching neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have put in to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that unsocial behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after being evicted
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the rubbish that surrounds the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 g of hemp, as well as weights, belongings and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for a tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rules of renting the premises.
Angela Crow, from the Devon and Cornwall police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
"This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the prosecution's accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior," she said.
“Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who adore sunbathing, terrified for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that he was conducting a training flight, but insisted on the absence of a security risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane is spitting over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a touch of the hunters on a sandstrip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resting people jumped on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but not being able to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flight on social media, said: “It flew quite low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed like it would break down.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and I swear there was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me.”
Tourists at Aveiro Beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was conducting a training flight with the aim of detecting fishing vessels off the shore and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires that deteriorated visibility.
The plane was conducting a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the task.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for general meals for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system – risk analysis and critical control points – has been mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the general food sector in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CDU).
Verifications of the Rospotrebnadzor business for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials are laying down fines only for individual violations of the regulation (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASSP as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and preventing them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
The system is now used in all food businesses not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP operates on the territory of the TS.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HASSP requirement appeared in the TS technical regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production and not to restorers, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to make up for the lost.
Expected period of resumption of charter flights to Turkey - end of August - beginning of September.
But they will not cause a hectic demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government requesting permission for charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of selecting quality and affordable sea holidays is unsolvable, because in the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities are already booked by the end of September", - the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter services in August will not be significant.
According to the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Tourism Industry Union (PCT), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed, as yet, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly develop programs and agree with airlines on the necessary on-board directions,” said Pavel Rumyantsev, deputy director of communications and international projects of the North-West Regional Office of PCT.
According to him, the possible renewal of the charters is good news, but it will not affect the positioning of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours," - says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is certainly not worth counting on agitation - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the agitation should not wait.
“For Turkey, launching charters now is a rehearsal for next season,” Rumyantsev said.
"Opening charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season," said Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of statutory compensation payments within the approved rules related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The extradition of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions is provided for by Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of extradition are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free delivery of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers on the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions, due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
Based on these norms, the FNS of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 of paragraph 3 of Article 217 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation are exempted from the taxation of NDFL income in the form of the value of milk, issued to employees on the days of actual employment, by nozzles with harmful working conditions.
The Moscow Gasstroybank remained without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the license to carry out banking operations at the credit organization Shared Commercial Bank "GASSTROIBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC GASSTROIBANK carried out a high-risk credit policy related to placing money in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank’s assets have created a basis for the credit institution to implement bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in suspicious transit operations.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for a period of validity until the time of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution in accordance with federal laws are suspended.
JSC AKB "GASSTROIBANK" is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance reimbursement to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will start no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the data of the report, the size of assets of JSC "GASSTROIBANK" on August 1, 2016 occupied 335 place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, was reportedly killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a fortification of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a tombstone and a will to others, that these are the risks involved when traveling to a war zone - will discourage people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultans’ family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reed says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton’s Democratic presidential candidate will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland’s endorsement, but how President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Group leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland “with some degree of confidence.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he hadn’t spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would promote Garland, and was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "drop the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland’s nomination were “conspirators” and “co-conspirators” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the job.
Treats claims erotic calendars for 'women as well as for men'
Treats collaborates with photographer David Ballmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s by Pirelli.
But instead of naked celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked museums.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to go back to the demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, just like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscovites will be given memorabilia about dishonest online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to issue a memorandum that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that specialists of the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens correctly choose an online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
This will be general information and the legal framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect your legal rights.
The appendix will give recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so on," Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memory is currently being refined.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor on Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute to the Moscowers.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the name of the second suspect in the organization of diversion in the Crimea.
Detained persons from the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Mr. Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Mr. Zakhtey Andrey Romanovich.
“All of them give confessions,” the statement said.
Previously, a resident of the Zaporozhye region, Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt on interrogation.
FAS fined Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antitrust Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on the corporation Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the website of the agency.
The fine for Google for violation of antitrust law amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said Deputy Head of FAS Alexey Dotsenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies to the manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that the device will be installed and other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications is the search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Section 1 of Article 10 of the Federal Competition Protection Act (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a favorable effect on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed for all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, and for transnational corporations, including," said Elena Zaeva, head of the Department of Communications and Information Technology Regulation of FAS Russia.
The agency suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network has been fined for selling 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The New Bookstore chain has been fined for selling Stace Kramer’s book “50 Days Before My Suicide,” according to the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provocative or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
Ostankinsky District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products, arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor administration.
A source in the New Bookstore confirmed that it is a production of Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest book stores in Moscow are undergoing checks for the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow will be the evening of the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow will be the evening of the memory of the sculptor Ernst the Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Literaries.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to mention it in their homeland," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted that this is important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the Pushkin GMII Irina Antonova, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Department of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibsky.
Earlier it was reported that relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to hold a panic attack on the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
The End User of Vinyl: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
And as long as you haven’t rushed to block the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym “Not AllAloneMen of Middle Ages”, this claim stems from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussed revival of records is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to penetrate the novelty of the material subject, but to the nostalgia of the middle ages.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high percentage of the likelihood are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
This is also not just an act of collecting amateurs - it has an emotional meaning: older buyers of vinyl are slightly more likely to keep their feelings in them (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the center of the lively Soho street, in a modest gray suit and rushing gestures in front of the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Yes, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores have now flooded the buildings once occupied by independent sellers – several music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I’m close to different people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional mood through observation.
A native of Glasgow, Stewart, 55, for whom I went from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably older than 20), in London for half a day to spend a few hours meeting, and walking around, shopping.
He's a collector, I ask.
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, depicted above (he sent me a picture by email, I didn’t chase him home), line up the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles comes in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they just came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and at a bargain.
"A lot of what I'm acquiring is the late '60s, the early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy for," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink very much.
That's my fault.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets match the profile of YouGov.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of the noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy back their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revival figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weeze, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to drift away in the perpetuity of familiar envelopes for records, items that awaken memories of quiet youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling in emptiness or possessing material things as a kind of calming,” says Wez.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It’s an easy way to take your head.
“We’re like their social workers!” said a colleague from the record store.
An ICM poll in April showed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month hadn’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41 percent have a record player that they never use, while 7 percent of those who buy vinyl have no record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled by the leafy shelf with Bosanov’s collections.
The "trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men) noticed.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,’” he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, a little less than twenty, who just get acquainted with it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples over 70, tourists who photograph, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less casual than in the aforementioned stores – the latest synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns – it’s nice to see diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleonora, 27, walked the Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She looks at goods, not spends money.
She does not earn much, she says, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." - she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban fashionistas.
As I create the illusion that I’m looking at jeans shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
On the left is the staircase, the wall of which is laid by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking - perhaps because they are just a decoration, some are located so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl".
But given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for a while, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
It’s no wonder that a layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work all the time in schools or offices.
But they clearly don’t spend the morning of Thursday strolling down Berwick Street for record stores, leafing records and avoiding the glances of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake performer who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer to shut down shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a hearing this week, Calais said the state should be able to run a total of 72 homemade stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents) or the simplest meals in a few euros.
Calle Prefecture said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The court ruled that there was no legitimate reason to expel people running 72 homemade stores, but said the problems in Kale Prefecture "were fully understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said bakeries, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely shaky conditions.”
He said the spaces provided peaceful meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Children's Café at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and advice on providing shelter for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years".
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle Camp has grown to more than 9,000 — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
The libraries of microdistricts invite young libertarians to cognitive programs.
This week, the libraries-branches will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physician.
The programs are aimed at the children’s audience, so most of them will be in play form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in a linear microdistrict, invites to the cruise-presentation "My Town is Small".
On August 11th in the branch library No. 1 will be held the regional hour "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the branch library No. 2 on the same day will be held multimedia lesson "Land of the native past destiny".
And in the branch library No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the boys from the northern microdistrict, the branch library No. 3 will hold a game program "Fiskult-Hi!".
Britain stops on silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold
The UK’s impressive Rugby-7 series was crushingly halted at the final hurdle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on possession of the ball, pass, evasion, support of the game, running lines and brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Rugby-7 Olympic tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of the Boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier that day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji won in such a form as can not be better team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a trip to the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These strikes will cause pain, but the progress is striking.
Fiji started great, for fun, thwarting the UK's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau plunged into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuvai added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell kept mountain man Leon Nakarawa from scoring a third, but this only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jassa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more lazy attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The result was 29-0 in a break.
It looked as if Fiji had been born to play rugby-7, while Britain is still mastering the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is.
Britain made massive substitutions halfway through the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for Britain by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game has long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the joyful approach of Fiji.
Mata William embellished a Fijian cake, which did not need embellishment, another attempt in the last seconds.
There was a whistle, Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the United Kingdom slightly bypassed South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one attempt each – the difference in British realization.
Kyle Brown pulled the Box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, using some great leg work, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant final attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, the 15th brother to the England team, Anthony, secured the victory—and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing race by a coach's fight with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy lifts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the paddle, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there as long as they aspired to the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold rammed a battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to gradually growing victories that matter, and no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would survive to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little bit your vision for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said it was enough for a few steps.
This is how it starts.
Travelling is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of an artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and so has Robin.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nobody, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in store.
We were very in phase.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t trying to do something amazing.
We weren’t waiting for the fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to be able to do well and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple of years to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at her wedding next month, on her own with TV adventure seeker Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food products banned for import into Russia.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country to circumvent the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tonnes of prohibited products were seized from the sale.
Hunting for "forbidden"
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, which will bring rainfall and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees Celsius.
So, at night on Saturday in Moscow places will have short-term rain, storms and wind gusts up to 15 m/s are possible.
Rain is expected during the day with thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezh regions, according to Dni.ru.
Precipitation is unlikely next week.
The WTO’s panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are inconsistent with the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia at the time of its accession to the WTO.
"This is the first time the WTO has made a decision against Russia," the statement said on the organization's official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "were of a comprehensive nature".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the United States in resolving disputes in the WTO undermines the principles of the organization’s discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the refusal of the Americans to approve the second term of South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012 .
In the administration of the President has changed the head of
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed the head of his own administration of the former deputy Sergey Ivanov Anton Vino.
Vladimir Putin made changes in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vino during the meeting said that he considers important anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as the head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the position of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the realignment will not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who worked in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built up the activities of the AP.
In his place came Deputy Head of Administration Anton Vino - a man who knows perfectly well the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years the supply of gas from Russia may become unattractive to it due to the refocusing on fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish finance company Boguslav Ma<0xC5><0xBE>ets.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main delivery destinations for us will be the East, the raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," Ma<0xC5><0xBE>ets said.
Gazprom currently occupies a dominant position in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG’s purchases rose to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish antitrust authority did not agree to the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland had left a request for Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic meters of gas to Nord Stream-2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding company Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of "Nord Stream-2" will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to conduct an auction for its stacking.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom is not yet planning to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said the vice chairman of the board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased by 42% the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
Deputy Gazprom added that the mere fact of submitting the Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the end of the negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company had appealed to the courts to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
The Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure of the Polish Government, Petr Naimski, said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s gas and energy infrastructure commissioner, Petr Naimski, said his country could give up its supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new liquefied natural gas supply terminal Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 envisages the construction of two sea gas pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant question from journalists, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers monitored what was happening at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the network appeared a video landed at Ufa airport passenger plane Yak-42, which rolled outside the runway by 400 m and crashed on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
It happened at 4.30 in Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates on a regular basis.
The Volga Investigation Department on the transport of SKR was engaged in figuring out the reason for the rigid landing of the aircraft liner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura considers the fact to be indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, appeared on August 2.
The opposition then said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the previous day, the aviation dropped bombs with poisoning, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the incident of the opposition group "Harakit Nur al-Din al-Zinqi".
Soon it became known that there were two gas-filled bombs.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, my eyes started to burn, it became difficult to breathe," the eyewitness said.
As a result of the attack at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “Evidence that this really happened is a lot.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and the terrorists are preventing the evacuation of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered "insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped".
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed every week to deliver aid to the city and evacuate the sick and wounded.
"We have to send bulk cargo from a column of trucks in the area, where the roads are almost destroyed, and what remains is mined," - said Mr. Egelann. - But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.
Consultations in Geneva between U.S. and Russian representatives on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
Russia has opened “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the face of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second-largest Syrian city, Russia announced on August 11 the introduction of a three-hour ceasefire regime, which will operate daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Russian Defense Ministry was taken against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to overturn the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions immediately erupted in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people died and 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions hit the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country’s interior ministry has hastened to state that the Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country's leading military.
Attacks have occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
Since the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth has fallen from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few industries to show development.
In 2016, the country was visited by 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the country's interior ministry "is convinced that they are not related to international extremist groups".
“It’s too early to draw conclusions,” Patanacharoen said.
But we know with certainty that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithich Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees in the bustling streets filled with dining tourists in restaurants.
One of the dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food in the area.
The identity of the other victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and a citizen of Austria.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturism reported.
Local experts also linked the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament is fully appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the country's prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup d'état took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country's army commander Prayut Chan-ocha.
In this step, he said, the army was driven by an ongoing political crisis and lack of progress in the negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, introduced the ruling clock and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
In January 2014, the Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions took place in central Bangkok near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, injuring 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions caused unknowns on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect the protesters.
In Dry Lodge, the development of conditions began.
As it became known, the government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold mine with the maintenance of two key limitations.
It is proposed not to admit to the auction companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not have at least 25% of the state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature introduced to the government a draft order and the conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold ore deposit in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), said two sources familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
In the Ministry of Nature confirmed "U" that the project was submitted to the government.
A representative of the supervising submarine use Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Kloponin said "U" that the project has not yet entered the office of the official.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the government's order is issued, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held already in October," the Ministry of Nature said.
According to <0xD0><0xAA>, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as outlined in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIAs for approval in July (there is <0xD0><0xAA>).
The first is the presence of at least 25% of the state participation in the capital of the applicants.
The second is the refusal of access to the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about non-investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles specified in the draft FZ, as already written by "U" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal importance (stocks of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The requirement for state participation in the capital of the participants of the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, "U" was said in December 2015 in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroshchenko.
Who lobbied the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of "U" do not specify.
"But it is in the spirit of time: not to give control in the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," - argues the interlocutor "U", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergei Donskoy on August 1 stated that foreigners "can go to the consortium", if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The interlocutors of "U" consider it unlikely that the conditions in the government will be adjusted.
The main contender for the Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation "Polyus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostekh".
In July, the partners created SP "SL Gold", where "Polyusa" shares 51%, the structure "Rosteha" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Poles said that they were "certainly interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions have been announced," the statement said.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision was taken by the Russian government, sources said.
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, said they could participate in the development of the Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to U, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Industries of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kashuba, estimated the investment in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are not only afraid of the volume of investments, but also the complexity of the project: serious preliminary exploration of inventories and technologies for working with complex ores, explain the interlocutors of "U" in the industry.
The largest M&A transaction has been launched in the pension market – KIT Finance Pension Administrator has launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of "Gazfund Pension Savings" will be created NPF with a savings volume of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure of the merger of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "PromagroFund", "Legacy" and "Gazfonds Pension Savings" - the owner of 100% of funds LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" announced yesterday.
"The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the current contracts," the company said in a statement.
The association is carried out on the basis of "Gazfund Pension Savings".
As noted by the general director of this NPF, Oleg Bialoschitsky, the merger of funds allows to solve several problems: expansion of the geography of the presence, concentration of resources for development, reduction of costs, publication of best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate deadline for the completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF "Gazfund Pension Savings" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As can be seen from the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfund" (35%).
However, the group itself launched the group much later on competitors.
Thus, the controlled group of O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfonds" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Combination into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," said Nikolay Sidorov, Director General of the Future NPF.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been going on since April and in the pension group "Safmar" - the NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" should be merged into the NPF "Safmar" by the end of this year.
In 2017, the NPF "Doverie" will join them.
"The merger of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operating processes and costs," the Saffmar pension group said.
The pause in the pooling of funds, which was endured by "KIT Finance Pension Administrator", may be caused by several reasons, experts indicate.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds issued, in which the group was actively located.
After the amendments to the Central Bank’s order in March this year for a number of issuers that meet the regulator’s requirements, such restrictions are no longer there.
If necessary, the entire issue can be redeemed by one major player", - says the director of the rating group of financial institutions Yuri Nogin.
Several of the top 15 asset managers of the NPF call the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund, which should have been agreed by the group’s owners, another possible cause of the pause.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
To the request of "U" in the NPF "Gazfond" were also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive event, the long-distance decision will be justified.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov, the "Pension Savings Gazfond" has fewer outflows, the accession will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofonda" in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on the four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings "Expert RA".
"The effect of the reduction of duplicating functions will unambiguously overwhelm the possible costs of the combination," Mitrofanov said.
The cost of merging four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"The costs for the maintenance of four funds of this size amount to about 400 million rubles per year, with the consolidation in the medium term, the budget will actually be cut by half", - Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The best Disney movie "Pete and the Dragon" has been released in Russia.
Beautiful sights of New Zealand, a charming dragon, a soulful history and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in the traps and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, grazed and in a hip bandage, can no longer be distinguished from another thoughtful forest wasteland - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired woman Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively sweeping the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete takes an accelerated course of “being human” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their hearts and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too awful for the viewer to really start hating or fearing him.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for the atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an irreparable villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be scary at all, with a good morbidity of a bulldog, an aircraft wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny whispering, whispering, even croaking and, fortunately, does not say, but he wants to flatter all the time, in this he is advantageously different from all known cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of holding provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults, start crying desperately in the three streams.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, breaking between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously betrays a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to shoot a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie “Dragon Pete,” medium-sized from nose to tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and feature film, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
Not how a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lori from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There was a lot of music and a lot of weird jokes.
This good fairy tale reads traits borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other cute children's pictures.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon is not as stunningly beautiful as the same Jungle Book, and there is no skilled villain in it as Kate Blanchett turned out to be the stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from Disney's magical castle will be given to director Lowry once again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan".
David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks have entered a new ambitious project about an immature boy based on the James Barry fairy tale of the same name.
RBC journalist Aleksandr Sokolov will be charged
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found flaws in their case.
The fact that the prosecution made such a statement, we learned from the investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to take part in the court hearing on the issue of limiting access to the criminal case materials, but the meeting did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the presentation made by the prosecutor's office", - the RBC quotes the words of lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said the prosecutor’s office had pointed out to the investigators the inconsistency of the case’s qualifications and the collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to eliminate the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CPC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As reported by "<0xD0><0xAA>", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the indictment of the journalist of the RBC the wording of "devolution of the political situation towards instability" and "the overthrow of power illegally".
Alexander Zilbert, the correspondent of Kommersanttubeboscosport, lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian national team, dined in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
Life here doesn't seem to freeze for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half to two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village is carried out without stopping, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
At 7:30 in the morning in one of the temporary tents stretch the heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our, consider, exemplary - it was put into operation even in the first place, and demonstrated all
The one with the hot water problem, then, sorry, with the toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to come, but only crap with some substance on the floor, and everything.
The floors are, you see, innovative.
They can't be washed humanely.
We know these floors are ordinary laminate!
In general, we have achieved a change of cleaning company and now everything is ok with it.
The Olympic Village is such a Yuzhnoye Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive ditch, places flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is also a two-meter iron fence around the perimeter, along which automatics walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems are probably the most pressing for the domestic team.
At the check-in desk there are two ads: printed "Please do not throw the paper in the toilet!" and from the hand "Accept a gift badge.
The stand itself drowns in booklets.
Their cheerful coloring contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Remembrance of infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid with drowning, getting a foreign body into the airways, loss of consciousness - stages of heartburn
The text inside is very encouraging in general.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house, including a relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is actually the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are fearful believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater upliftment of the spirit, the announcement hangs: “Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Cyril, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by the patron saint Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeyev.
You can order prayers and other requests by phone...
In general, there is a Center of Meditations and Religious Rites on the territory of the village for representatives of all religions.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the dark he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping co-workers of the new cleaning company.
I suppose, in readiness at any moment to throw on the wash of innovative floors they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time acquaintance - Vitaliy Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our battists, who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, the champion of Europe, Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
Complaining on a large scale is not something, - shares the impressions of the well-deserved coach of Russia. - We live for two, the beds, of course, almost a nod, but it is uncritical.
Sanuzel is one in four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not cause trust, but things can be put.
"No, you're pretending, they're out of tea!" - Svetlana Kuznetsova, a tennis player, I met in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it is a space of 2,7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
There are over 60,000 servings per day for free.
The menu options are as follows: "Best of Brazil", "Kitchen of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I have seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let’s say, I didn’t find soup in any of the departments of a giant restaurant.
What soups? - wonders Kuznetsov. - No tea!
It's good that I've taken a Chinese with me, a braided one.
And a kettle.
But as you can see, our food on the courtyards is even worse.
You can at least choose something here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally chose cod for a couple and fries in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, it was edible, to say the least.
I don’t even understand why such a line is standing all the time at a local McDonald’s.
Satisfied, relaxed, you can say "warm" athletes at the exit of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They are tricked cleverly - with a quiz, the winner of which gets a t-shirt.
Provoked, you might say!
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me a girl from WADA.
But I didn't attack it.
So I got into a patriotic thrust, of course.
The situation has already been exacerbated by the second question: "If I have been notified of a doping check, should I immediately go to a doping checkpoint?"
I stopped at option B: “No – I have one hour.”
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to wait for WADA to weaken.
Well, you have to come right away.
Well, in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
I somehow thought that if it would be difficult for me to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and for me, by the way, difficult!), then I could use bio-additives to get “additional nutrients to boost my performance.”
Anne, no, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not forbidden, but insistently, in several sentences, it is rejected.
WADA is playing this unfairly!
What’s up, Russia? – asks the leading quizzes.
Nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our bloodless team.
That’s why I concentrated and won an unfortunate T-shirt from my last effort.
Know what they say, ours.
In a victorious mood I stumbled into the gym in the neighborhood.
Get involved in the counting of trainers.
It hit 250.
With surprise, he noted that in this accumulation of treadmills, no Russian athlete was found.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who can’t play train!
But in a clinic next door, one of our guys was sitting there.
A queue to the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, it's not a shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as in the whole village, wherever you spit, hangs a device for the delivery of condoms.
It has an inspiring appeal: "Praise with a condom!"
Next, it remains only to twist the iron, reminiscent of the handle of the door lock, and a condom made of natural Amazonian latex is ready to fall out of the machine.
I took one for myself, in remembrance.
Athletes will not be spared - they brought them 450,000.
Just for a festive and leisurely pastime in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
Next to it, just in case, there is a sign reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in different ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video gyms.
What is this? - I am interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team, who actively uses a wild toy.
You could, of course, just say that you do not want to talk to a person in the form of a Russian national team, and everything.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence of circumstances in the eyes of the cut from the boys in yellow-blue.
The most playful team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at every corner of it, it takes at least three hours.
But, if you go, and not drive an electric car, you will open the house of a Canadian team with a hawk at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a barber shop, and a flower shop, and a shop with goods of daily consumption and
And late in the evening, you, exhausted, will sit near an olive tree suspended with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that's unnecessarily spraying liquid to kill insects, thinking of forever.
This is about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world hid its breath watching the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went on the net.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rap at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
“Maybe I’m the only Moscovite who’s ever seen it happen – not to mention the ones who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a true fan can understand this.
Imagine: a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors downstairs – as always at night – wake up and start unharmed, but very loudly yelling at each other.
Threatening to move furniture.
In the kitchen there is a faucet - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the television schedule, so just kept the channels "Match", "First" and "Russia" under control - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the home of repetitions, all the sport there for some reason in the records.
There, the series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for the "Match" - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news releases first about the great semi-final Deriglazov--Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the USA--Australia.
By the way, I can’t say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing and won the first half.
They put in place officers of their own greatness Americans.
As a result, they still lost, but as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It’s all good, but the fight with Di Francesca is approaching, and on the screen there is no change.
In a panic, I start to see channels.
It feels like a second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep on the cables.
There's no fencing on any of the themed Matches.
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
The text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Boat surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the "First" website, it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this time.
I click on the fence, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazov perfectly counterattacks, goes forward on glasses - and obviously starts to pull the time.
The Italian plays almost the entire distance.
Ours is one point ahead, until the end just over two seconds.
Di Francesca throws at Deriglazov, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman gives the injection.
Victory!
In a few seconds, an Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
I was the first to see it with my own eyes.
Insane, faithful, involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenary ordered its imams to preach Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars to “learn their native language.”
The administration said that this "in no way violates" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazan mourns that up to 60% of parishioners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the whole audience".
Yesterday, the plenary of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in the Tatar language.
According to Tatarstan mufti Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
"For those who will say that it is "heavy", in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language absolutely free of charge," - promised Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques of the sermon "must be already in the Tatar language".
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, "can thoroughly prepare for them".
DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all the municipalities of the republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday sermons are exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, the Russian language was used in a number of mosques in Kazan.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Bournaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhammetshin stressed, management sets the task that all students should speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"No offense of Muslim netatars can be spoken of," Mr. Muhammetshin emphasized, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a compulsory, the main part of prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will still be read in Arabic, in the mosques there will be lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhammetshin said “U” that there was no serious threat of the expulsion of the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WTC).
The head of the executive committee of the VCT Rinat Zakirov said: "Mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone out of this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the WCT "consider it right".
The "U" imams interviewed, who preached in Russian, are ready to execute the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties in understanding the clergy.
Both Russians and Tatars go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they will be sad.
"It will have to be rebuilt," says Imam of the Bournaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, sermons in Russian are even closer to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools and kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere is original".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show you the way out of this situation,” he concluded.
About 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are both Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
There are many foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we’ve been switching to Russian for four years,” the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will “reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
The result of the preaching will be different.
But time will tell.
“For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language,” said Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former FSIN Director Sued
The Moscow Prosecutor’s Office approved the indictment on the investigated GSU SCR criminal case on the theft of budget funds allocated for the needs of the FSIN of Russia.
Before the court will appear the former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, which caused FSIN damages in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office has sent a criminal case to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court in relation to the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolay Krivolapov, as well as the director of the FGUP “Center of Information Technology Support and Communications of the Federal Service for the Execution of Penalties” (FTOU).
Depending on the role and the degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of GSU SCR on Moscow under article 3 of article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of office powers, which has caused serious consequences), article 4 of article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed by the group using its own service).
In addition, Krivolapov is accused under Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently hijacked the budget funds allocated by the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the company under their control, FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and implemented at prices that were exaggerated several times.
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production capacities that allow to create a completed cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts for the amount of more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were stolen from the accounts of the Samaritan branch of the FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash disbursed was personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, whose criminal case was allocated to a separate proceeding.
Nikolay Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found unknown the origin of the ammunition to the award pistol, which allowed him to file an additional charge.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles to the accused.
Footballer Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the former footballer, and then a member of parliament Hakan Shukur, and conducted searches in two houses of his family.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, attacker Hakan Shukur is being sought by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup last month.
Forward, who quit his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".

Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-produced films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which the screens reach an average of 20-25 tapes.
“Even they find it very difficult to compete with ‘Transformers’ and ‘Iron Man’, who have huge budgets in their promotion,” he said.
On July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Mias (Chelyabinsk region) detained lawyer of former deputy governor Nikolay Sandakov Konstantin Akulic.
As reported by "U-South Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergey Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> was summoned to the investigation department of the SC Miass to file an indictment in the case of a year ago on the infliction of blows.
Then Konstantin Akulic went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"Initially, it was raised against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolay Sandakoff, it turned out that it was Akuli<0xC4><0x87>," - says Sergey Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulic became a lawyer for the former deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the call of the lawyer to the SC Miasa, the defense was informed that on Monday, the deadline for reading the materials of the fraud case, in which Nikolay Sandakova is accused, expires.

The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has undertaken the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh Melting Plant.
The Karabakh Melting Plant was founded by an English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the vitality of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, which resulted in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh Melting Plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already sadly known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company went under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabakhmed in the first few days of July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the grand changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabakhmed transferred to the RMK group.
The main event for the modernization of "Karabashmedi" in recent years was the construction of a new sulphuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of Karabashmed JSC is the reconstruction of the converter terminal.
Replacement of three converters, injectors, gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial sewage treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes deducted to the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the project of the Tominsky GOK - from the beginning of construction and until the commissioning of the second phase - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of GOK, the income of taxes in the budgets of all levels can be 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna district, budgets of different levels have been transferred to 346.3 million rubles.
And this is for the first year.
"The longer the company successfully operates, the greater the amount of deductions can be," - added Valery Ulanovsky.
The RMC clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from the Mikheevsky GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertainment facilities, to improve the landscaping.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was capital repair, and in fact - almost complete restructuring of kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.

The pensioner turned the stirrup into a "budget beach tower".
Users of the network laughed at the photos on which the elderly man installed a starboard board on the beach and turned it into a jumping trampoline in the water.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the group "My Taganrog" in the social network "VKontakte", due to which many decided that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was dubbed "budget tower" and "mobile trampoline".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sweetness", and some pointed to the fact that the man seriously risks getting injured when jumping from his height, since he installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea by the photo.
"Firstly, we don't know what depth there is, the beach can be bulky with a steep descent of a meter just behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with the right ability you can jump from a couple of meters," - wrote the user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ

Miguel was found guilty of committing the crimes provided for in Articles 286 ("Excess of powers"), 285.1 ("Non-target spending of budget funds") and 285 ("Misuse of office powers") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that in December 2008, the official provided his acquaintance with a plot of land in the village of Mukhinka in violation of the procedure established by the land legislation.

Owners of messengers and postal services must identify users and remove prohibited information - such is the brief content of the bill, developed by the Media-Communications Union (ICS), which unites the largest Russian communications operators (it is at Vedomosti).
Employees of the three companies - members of the union confirmed that such a project is being discussed.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of the Democrats’ servers.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, The Wall Street Journal writes, citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to formally accuse Russia of attacking servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are practically confident of Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hack into the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, for which the responsibility was officially assigned to the DPRK.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but can also be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, writes the publication.
Even if the officials concluded that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before making a decision to disclose the information.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier, it was reported that the Obama administration allows the possibility of sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason is the distortion of competition in the mobile application market.
Antitrust proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gives smartphone manufacturers access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company was abusing the dominant position in the market and imposing on mobile device manufacturers the installation along with the Google Play store of other applications.
As a result of the verification, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, the deputy head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko said.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the law on the protection of competition must be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then determine with further action: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antitrust Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law in September last year and ordered the contracts to be adjusted until December 18.
Google, however, did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been prosecuting.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a global agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion "Echo of Moscow" expressed the leading analyst Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized as a Cartoon for Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it is racially tactless.
With the help of the "Lins" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to paint Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, twisting tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become well-known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark facial skin or encouraging whitened faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them bent eyes, curved teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist caricature of Asians — “yellows.”
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions pointed to a more serious company problem related to diversity.
On Wednesday, reports spread, followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a tribute to the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon for Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American arts student whose tweets about the photos were actively shared, said the lens was “insulting and at least embarrassing.”
She added that "it's hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but highly demeaning yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural bridges.
American culture seems engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean that they are more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhou said, “this course of events is much harder to go unnoticed than it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity when recruiting staff in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white leadership of the company, consisting only of men, and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Zhou, who is also of Chinese descent, wrote: “Either they did not have enough non-white people in the state who could make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they do not occupy positions that can be spoken out safely and openly.”
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origins of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and on active attempts to involve internal resources.
For her part, Zhou said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that’s not going to happen.”
Military leadership misrepresented intelligence about ISIS, reports congressional commission
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the grounds for the events on the ground, the congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Republican presidents of the House of Representatives Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among the analysts of the intelligence service of the Central Command who confirmed that
The Central Command, known as the Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the CENTCOM's top command tended to give a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than is confirmed by real data from the scene, and were steadily more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," the statement said.
“What happened in the Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with leadership in the Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report examines in detail the shortcomings that constantly emerged in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing the U.S. actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration’s leadership ordered the reports to be falsified, he argues that analysts felt the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly said that a major military attack aimed at returning Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, this is known for sure,” Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top leadership of the US Central Command intelligence service falsified command intelligence documents to mitigate the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they found out that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report, published Thursday, will be followed by more detailed data.
The additional investigation of the Centcom intelligence is carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee published their own data on Thursday, which agrees with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, the CENTCOM established an excessively closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party’s chief representative on the committee.
This procedure, Schiff said, “has blocked the release of intelligence documents,” has damaged the moral status of analysts and “does not adequately reflect divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to adjust their findings to a “dated or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon Chief Inspector, opened after the complaints of analysts of the Centcom.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes diverge in the interpretation of integrated data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the goal of the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now claimed by more and more representatives of the Department of Defense) is being achieved.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic State repeats the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when the analyst of the intelligence service of the Center, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article, which claimed that the administration of the President of the year George W. Bush because of the protest of many analysts, and that the ombudsman in support of a small amount of the ombudsman.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest triggered by Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker's team came to the conclusion that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group, which is why they
But the discovery was not disseminated outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then CENTCOM commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after witness testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins four consecutive women's grass hockey games, bringing it closer to a decisive clash with Britain
Once scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Kathy Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's grass hockey team, when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam says she’s not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I will not use my mind," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keep track of their goals.
Here’s what she knows: the Americans scored 4-0 in the Olympics, and they’re competing for first place in their group against Britain, which remains unbeatable after Japan lost 2-0 on Thursday.
The U.S. and British teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who will take the second place.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of the other group, a little while before the games of the quarterfinals begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans made a lot of noise here with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a stick for grass hockey when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012 when she and her teammates did not get along.
The following year, Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an awkward hand on a short distance.
India approached the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sharply sent the ball to the goal, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
Same as Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the odds of the Olympic Games - "zen" jumping on a trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, this is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and unavoidable, this is a furious combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic fire itself, there is that burning torch that is transmitted from a bowman to a swimmer, to a gymnast, to a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in the cafe, and not hear about Simone Bailes, Katie Ledacke, or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dolly, the first Olympian to participate in the Olympics, a handsome man with cheekbones, could well be among those celebrities shown in the prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fetishist.
But 28-year-old Dolly from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympics by jumping on a trampoline.
The Olympic light does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, there are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with a pneumatic gun, shooting with a bow, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reign.
But if I am allowed to shyly speak in defense of my personal bias, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on a trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Games in Sydney, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they belonged to the Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men’s prizes, while Chinese and Canadians share women’s prizes.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLenan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on a trampoline has the charm of an outsider, in particular because for an unenlightened ear it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
Here I must admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential – this is the caricature of endless jumps – but also the exquisiteness of gymnastics and jumping in the water, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word “batut” comes from the Spanish word “el trampolín”, meaning “tramplin for jumping into the water”.
Winners jump on a giant trampoline, flying nearly 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and jumps) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated for performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most prevalent Olympic course is forward.
The contenders for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of the gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, here and there on the field.
They aspire not only to the finish line or the start wall, but also, in view of the cameras, to another annoying frontier: a world or Olympic record.
This stubborn aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the viewer weep.
But I think it’s a bit exhausting to watch the games.
Jumping on the trampoline gives him a respite.
The battist's direction is up.
Going forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they, of course, do not go without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no jumps in length, only a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest to zen Olympic sport.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of a daily program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a quiet, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in the general landfill.
And if awareness-raising can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to lustful views and objectification — as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States — Dooley is just waiting for her new admired crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of a rift?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a steadfast ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s reaction was brutal.
Eyewitnesses said police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage of the protests, allegedly taken at the end of last year or earlier this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It’s always been hard to keep this country from breaking up, and it’s going to be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project at the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy – human rights organizations constantly mention government repression – the opposition in the state was suppressed by the fact that the dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
“If people are constantly oppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seium Teshome, a professor at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation protested.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely displaced the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the riots and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings, which have been boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, are erupting now.
The first, apparently, completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highland areas flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But it also changes.
“We will act together under a single principle,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6% of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts claim that he particularly skillfully recognized the first signs of discontent and used intelligence to obtain data and defeat opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that as a result, it will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was apparently an election that the government stunned and then falsified the results.
In the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed gratitude to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as a new intercity train and significant achievements in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growth of domestic discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked enterprises owned by Tigray, and anti-Tygray hatred on social media is becoming widespread.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it will be difficult to pass through this stretched rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to sweep the latest conflict that swept his election headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to reasonably address the American people.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of turmoil, in an embarrassing position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking at a congress on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just shrugging.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy against the backdrop of a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to come back to this topic.
Again on Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to tax hikes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew widespread criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course, I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take back his words if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing some messages that find a response among his fans, watching how they act, and then ‘explaining’ them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cautious in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the utterances for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more offensive tone in recent days as his rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking published on Friday showed that Trump outperforms Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and keeps up with her in Florida.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the subject of increased attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an embarrassing position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Juliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputies, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it happened, because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans say that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to evolve as it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for dismissing each of his words and bias against him.
He mocked the "poor unlucky" television experts who were trying to figure him out and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as more proof that he is not fit for president.
A once-displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee shop was overcrowded, accepting only cash in Williamsburg, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
The "Soup Sherry" store, which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is selling soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the renovating city.
The artist, Molly Krabapple, tweeted: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But while New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The revitalized Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new "Verbe" has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
And the coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he would be happy to go.
Rodriguez, who is 36, left much in his former form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of bagels and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even installed chandeliers from the old "Verb".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new meals.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings from capers or roasted onions.
There are rice dishes.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now prepares freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had paid attention to the unchanged flow of old regular customers.
“Many former customers were also squeezed out of Williamsberg,” he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, had previously lived in Williamsberg and frequently visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still going there.
After the Verba closed, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verbe,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the usual iced coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing all the time.
“At fifteen minutes eight, every day, like a clock, I came and they cooked my bagel with oil and all the fillings for me,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he changes something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of "Soup Sherry" proposed to make a special soap for "Verba", using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also admired this coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors feel desired.
The new place has other benefits.
A local point for selling juices plans to pour bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new location, Whitt said that by going inside and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had come home.
“How long have I wanted to feel that smell,” he said.
Depressive food of depression in a "dense meal"
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as fu-gra and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - raspberry pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Cow's last book, Ragu in Chinese, was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a removable apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book, House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new joint work, Dense Meal, which will be published Tuesday by Harper Publishing, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a tiny small restaurant in the Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Cow, 57, took turkey, potato puree and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression era.
“Roulette was in great demand,” Siegelman said.
There was a peanut roulette, a baking roulette, a bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine that you have eaten as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coo wrinkled.
"He was probably lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was the Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared for the farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The "dense meal" describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” Cow said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and roasts, became the main foods; roast is a "perfect way to dispose of meals," - noted Siegelman, - because the cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under thick dough.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
Researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the era: roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table has not been successful," Co said.
Siegelman added, “It was very strange.”
Peanut butter is not suitable for baked onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
More than ever, and never since, household specialists—including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Households from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgetists”, take the challenge and turn a burda like wiped spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
A “dense meal” is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly spicy stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, President Herbert Hoover’s position in the spirit of “let the pies eat”.
Publicly proud of the simple farming ruins of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he ate like the refined millionaire he became.
"He liked the continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce," Co said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a maid who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House "consuming not only the most depressing food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the depression-era culinary practices were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and how science has been used in cooking.
The spouses say that at the time of writing the book they better understood mother Siegelman’s eating habits – that she could not throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of being negligent about food,” Co said.
Zieglerman recalls: “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was an unpleasant incident with the prophylaxis.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, Cow and I got a dessert they had made at home: a raspberry dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called mustard mousse," Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes hasty names.
There was no crushed cream, only raspberries, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in viscous, brown, sticky matter.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coo asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of a confident budget maker, he told his wife: "A little chopped walnuts wouldn't interfere here."
Arrest of those involved in the mass fighting at the Cemetery prolonged until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under the arrest of those involved in the mass fighting at the Khovansky cemetery, satisfying the corresponding request of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14, a mass clash of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with weapons took place at the Cemetery, resulting in the death of three people.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuyev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov was charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions for 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters for how much pension needs to be raised in order to level the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are summarizing the results of the semester, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," - quotes Golodets "Interfax".
Commenting on the proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Developments, Alexei Kudrin, the scheme of raising the retirement age for six months each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this topic is not considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition for shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan took part in the final of the competition for shooting from a small-caliber rifle from the position of lying at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
As reported by TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan came in second with 628.9.
There were eight of the best athletes in the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état," the French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gülen as saying.
The Turkish opposition also said that "if at least some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gülen denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
Istanbul’s court has previously detained opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
The attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to Refund Advocacy Costs During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of advocacy services it incurred in connection with a patent dispute over a hepatitis C drug with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc., the federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead’s medicines, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including false oaths and others.
Speaking in court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the lab work underlying Sofosbuvir, Gilead’s drug ingredient.
U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
The U.S.-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now purging the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darvish of the SDF-allied military council of Manbij told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting clearance operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for performances, and the former secretary of state declared an income of $3 million to the Goustán of the publisher Simon & Schuster for his books.
Potential Clinton vice president, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton's chief of staff, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement.
In complete contrast to them, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common for presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the audit of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton Chief of Staff adviser Jan Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic Party’s candidacy.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the end of the checks.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans in 2012, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed hold of the issue and released an online video Friday in which the main place was given to outstanding Republicans who convinced Trump to publish tax reporting.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done without exception for decades: publish his tax returns,” she said.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business reviewer on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that perhaps things are still going on.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was “fearful” not of the tax collecting agency, but of voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and an effective total tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index payroll fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from entering human settlements by throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Committee on Nature Conservation, took over its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use non-violent, four-step, non-violent, non-violent ways to protect their homes and communities.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit ... we’ve seen a change in attitudes within these communities, resulting in them being much more confident that they’ll be able to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants,” said Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are to ignite the torch in front of the border-breaking elephant and to send signals with the help of a horn.
If he can’t be frightened, they throw the so-called “chili cloud.”
Chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a flask in a condom, and its end is twisted, leaving only the flask outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with thunder, spraying the fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to deploy the elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, vivid explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July have not returned to Turkey.
Such data was quoted by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue work at the center.
Of these, 32 people without objective reasons and explanations did not return,” the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
In July, there was an attempted coup d’état in Turkey.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than 6,000 people, including the military ranks of the highest and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the phone code of Israel at the "request" of the Arabs, reported the channel RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent has unleashed a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's phone code on the list, with employees referring to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided to the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the hotel administration desk.
The answer he got there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said the measure was a “considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain.”
The reason behind this move caused the director to be even more angry.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed," Lanzman, a hotel official, said in a statement.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadass-Handelsmann, called the case a "terrible shame," reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is actually a terrible disgrace.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
There is no need for explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case has caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people have called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "goed over" the supposed demands of Arab customers.
"They would be ashamed," another post said, stating that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has rushed to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident a “failure to review” and “apologising” to Lanzmann, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the quick-release list," Kempinski Hotel spokesman Suddeutsche Zeitung said.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms of the state education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police tried to disperse students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to proposals by São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls directed against interim President Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reports the portal RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms in conducting business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year, a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year’s record in the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, which preserve the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The state continues to twist nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the orders of the CEO of the company "Almaz - Antey", "missing the job" and "loss of confidence".
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the context of a large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the defence-industrial complex (DIC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of order in the industry.
NGO "Almaz" - the main enterprise of the group, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (AIR systems) at sea and on land.
Currently, Almaz is working on the creation of the Polyment Redut and Morpheus missiles, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the breakdown of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redout" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, no truly successful test has been performed in several years of testing.
It is true, as far as I can judge, that there is no unambiguous guilt of the Diamante," Kornev said.
The expert fears that the delay with the commissioning may occur with the S-500.
Experimental design work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is planned and everything will be completed on time", although in 2014 the department recognized the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to give an assessment of the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been managing Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that the failure of deadlines for projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the PPP and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders of tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their posts at their own will, under an agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of the "Damaza" was perhaps a strenuous figure and resisted from the top-down "disarrays".
Apparently, the state is no longer willing to tolerate such behavior.
With the hands of shareholders, it will eliminate those who prefer to argue with the facilities of the Ministry of Defense and do not perform the tasks assigned.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the intruders (machines on the shipyard "Zvezda").
The President personally pays greater attention to the issues of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin is defending the ranks of the PKK managers, seeking to have a loyal staff of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the backdrop of corruption and lack of normal competition in the PPP, the state does not have other instruments.
The situation in defense is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of the managers in the OPC, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The staff of the army has acquired a new quality with the arrival of the post of Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has taken up the famous saying "You want peace - prepare for war".
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the "winners" in the Cold War eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world”, there may not be a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under these conditions, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scottish Callum Skinner runs on the finish line, as a result of which the British seize bicycle gold
Scottishman Callum Skinner raced for a triumph in a men's team sprint on a biker's bike in Rio last night, as a result of which the UK team trio defended their 2012 title from London.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was the strongest that his Scottish buddy Sir Chris Hoi made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, running along the finish line to snatch the victory from the New Zealand favourite team.
Britain claimed the rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the rights to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did just that when the Hindes came along.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny – the champions with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes drove on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a nice comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted he had deliberately fallen on the track after an unsuccessful start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain’s competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
“I felt like I was in London, with all the flags of Britain on the stands,” Hindes said.
We've all met as a team over the last three months.
We lost in so many world-renowned races that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the cyclist is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it’s not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeats Hoy’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would allow us to see how Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farrah and Roger Bannister) – is bringing his score to six gold medals.
It would be the same with Hoi.
Next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come here to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, if you're honest.
Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get knighthood."
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualify for the fastest four-kilometer team chase race of four.
They finished in 3:51,943.
The world record set when winning a 2012 London gold medal is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of qualifying, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In a women’s event that is resuming and ending tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roosevelt Sand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milwaukee improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the mid-term Olympics and earn a bunch of medals.
After indeed exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last – the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and harassment, and the resignations of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening on the bike, it seems that the legendary now glory of Britain in reaching the peaks at the right time may just happen again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is under threat because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all the supply contracts will be terminated.
The move is the result of a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend the subsidies granted in support of the plant’s operation.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly or indirectly – may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed its metallurgical plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa’s Portland metallurgical plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the short-term joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called hedged contracts, which were to come into effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017,” the company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in view of the “coming termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to manage the metallurgical plant or provide electricity to the metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November this year, but had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL’s chief operating officer, Stephen Mickelson, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the market [electricity].
For us as a manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only reality star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's manager mother Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defied fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“While I was in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the "Kardashian Family"?), prepared by a reality video in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenner (debossy Rob and Caitlin, also joined them by the universal most beloved uncle of the show?
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's TV shows dedicated to their birthdays (Sicrest utters the phrase: "You thought we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed something else to make this fame so or so.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim and got on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling issue of the year.
Thickly similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year’s 832-page edition contained advertising).
News about who of the stars will be on his cover is expected with such an impatience that in the last two years the photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who work as models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor was given to Lady Gaga.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as the "outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities aren’t celebrity relatives, reality show stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner’s position in the world of fashion, given her past reality TV star, should have always been shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "sluts of the moment".
These moods blurred again after the news of Jenner appearing on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to stick to dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells self-made photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality show on television.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 least-protected people refuse to serve in public legal centers, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further cut funding to the already marginalized activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair property deprivation, and so on—have already been denied access to free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services that are already operating outside their capabilities are preparing for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the Queensland Public Legal Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Public Legal Centers, thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not overturned, the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland’s public legal centers are constantly underfunded: that means thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and destructive debts, families going through divorce, unfairly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected residents of Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise free legal aid funding to the country’s average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the Palashchuk government is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s election headquarters was sued: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after the report that his North Carolina Operations Director threatened an employee with a gun when they were driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "this won't happen".
Director Earl Phillip "drawn his gun, put his right index finger on the handlebars, and pointed the dugout at Vincent's knee cup," said Bordini in the complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional offices of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip.
“The guns don’t have to be fired to cause damage,” Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a fuss, telling audiences in North Carolina that the "People of the Second Amendment" — understood as gun owners and its lovers — could begin to act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected.
Trump’s election staff said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the election headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for threats of physical violence, offense by action, and moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slowing down to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Philip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been campaigning for a controversial election.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the High Court for Mecklenburg County, Charlotte.
Britain should direct the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local settlements and throughout London, but throughout the country.
As far as I’m concerned, that was the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was with London in 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought a huge benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London in 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics made a mistake in 2012, and will prove them wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and within budget, from T5 – chosen by the airport’s best terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide the third runway, confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics was a huge success for the UK, and I’m sure the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
It’s time for us to take the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat-mouse" on the issue of ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software are a cat-mouse game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the layer around its ads, making it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims that it was able to circumvent the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of open-source ad blockers and those who try to bypass it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big the ad blockers have become for the industry.
Approximately 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe survey; almost four times more than those who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who visit Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, the advertising in the desktop version is a profitable enough article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more control over how they are targeted by advertising.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are a cause for concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so instead we’ve focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to hand over control to people.
A woman moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after the woman was moved by several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morge in the canton of Dans immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, the police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, calling on them and someone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a hit?
That’s what the prosecutor has to determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway - a verdict was issued that drivers cannot expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 off Pierne at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman — who responded to an emergency call — was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Was Once Inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to estimates from NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists from the Goddard Space Research Institute in Nassau have developed a model for studying the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine if on Venus, with its hot anhydrous surface and atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever exist conditions similar to Earth’s.
Scientists have previously assumed that the small speed of rotation of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus may have had a loose atmosphere, similar to Earth’s, and is still spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dim.
“According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus puts its day side on the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This heats the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella protecting the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are several degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the evolution previously assumed by planetary experts.
Despite the fact that Venus may have once been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/CEO of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“Over the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
“Over the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly match the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second discounted trip to participate in the Western Conference.
A goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups — two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil producers resume talks and halt strikes
Working strikes on the salary of oilmen in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the discussion are starting a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, which are managed by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current disputes,” the statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week to take a fresh look at the issues.
Trade unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cut came after a 10 percent rate cut for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to shut down oil and gas operations in countries up to 10, as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling prices for crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler Measures the Speed of Rotation of Stars in the Pleiades Cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis, told the press.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They are spinning as fast as they will ever be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these adult stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a inhibiting effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stellar spots, such as solar spots.
The latest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Fishball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In the ballet of the Pleiades, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars,” said Fisher.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
“The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both young and old,” said Ryball.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their “dance shoes” on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Fisher and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of detained Ukrainian saboteurs in Crimea is being conducted by two agencies, writes Kommersant.
The FSB gathers evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave confessions.
According to him, as objects for diversions, he considered the chemical plant Titan in Armeniansk, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that it was possible to detain not all of the saboteurs.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kyiv district of Simferopol, notes the publication.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a famous footballer who previously played in the Moscow "Spartacus" on the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartacus", "Pearl Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo" and "Varshavskaya".
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and is calculated for two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare the team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set before Stanislav Cherchesov the goal to bring the Russian national team to the semi-finals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian national team will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the position of the head coach of the Russian football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching in the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the team.
Native to Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to “refund costs”.
However, in Namibia, primary schools are free of charge.
Secondary education has been free of charge since 2015.
The country’s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past decade.
Despite the international trend of rising inequality, it is shrinking in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from nearly 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has Africa’s highest rating for freedom of speech, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is well ahead of the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favourable ranking - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the United States and most European countries.
There are, of course, some problems in Namibia.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional assessment methods, remains fairly high - nearly 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is one of the countries with higher incomes than the average, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia is undoubtedly facing some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which in one way or another should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia has not thought to drop its hands, the country solves the problems that it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbors did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that revenues from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production facilities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country’s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure it is.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state, Hage Heingob, noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustive.
Some - such as fishing - are considered renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than one million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can stand on the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest man-made gold objects (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand total weight 6 kilograms.
Only one burial known as the "grave No. 43" extracted 990 gold items weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon pass to the invisible gem found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite of Pazardzhik district.
The pearl is a golden stripe wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiyev, the head of the excavation at Telle Yunacite, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than Varna’s gold.
The treasures of Varna, we will remind, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
There are currently no technologies that allow the metal to be dated with impeccable accuracy.
How do you know which gold is the oldest?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I am absolutely sure that Yunacite gold is older than Varna gold.”
This is an extremely important finding: it is a tiny object, but it is large enough to occupy an appropriate place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadjiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and more thoroughly the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the beads with the greatest possible accuracy.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Today, Tell-Yunacite is considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, metalworking developed rapidly in the region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to emerge around metalworking centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Unazite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts were found here in 4900 BC.
I would call Tell Unazite a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even when compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Shumer,” says Boyajiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq.
It was there that the first cities in the usual sense of the word arose.
The excavations of Tella Yunacita have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, a "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunacite is often called the "City of Birds": dozens of clay figurines of birds have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The "City of Birds" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-meter stronghold walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by war axes.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual notions about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, born in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the gold luxury of Varna should have been preceded by something - something like a tiny gold beads created in Tella Yunacita.
Porsche artificially outdated the model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit, who work with serial machines.
The "retro-bow" is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed in 1960 for the model Porsche 356B - this color is painted even the logo of the model.
In addition, the targa received a proprietary white graphic along the edges and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel rims, as well as some body design details painted in "white-gold metallic".
In the interior, the retro lines are noticeably smaller: it is distinguished, in large part, by the gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and decorated with black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift car case and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive specialists have not touched the power plant: the retro-targa in characteristics quite matches the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 l, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car are reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an "armament race"
The recent introduction of Facebook’s technology that prevented ads from being hidden on social media pages has provoked developers to block ads from responding.
AdBlock Plus has released a “antidote,” but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
The social network’s representatives noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of “unblockable” advertising, the AdBlock Plus solution, along with commercial ads, also blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted such a policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among social media developers told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready in the coming hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race", trying to beat each other, the affected side became users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw advertising where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been causing heated controversy lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear in court <0xC2><0xB7> Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmansk region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum sentence in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 cross-country car and the Rich New pickup to Russia - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing popularity in China of the car class, combining the merits of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western companies Moscow International Auto Show this year decided to ignore, so the emptiness of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views on the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting innovations in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550,000 rubles at the current rate).
For the Russians, such a price list is unlikely to shine, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 as a result of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic suspension on the lower perimeter of the body it can be attributed to the cross.
The crossover is built on the front drive platform of the junior model Fengguang 360, the 370's has the same wheelbase at 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is solider, and the equipment is richer.
The interior is decorated with wooden panels, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" shown in the photo on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossroads, and cars with "music" came on sale easier.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - 1.5-liter petrol "atmospheric" 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed mechanical transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a budget-saving appetite of the owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Pickup Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the last generation, but with a slightly enriched Chinese stylists design.
Despite its morally outdated design, this model still enjoys stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious “working horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will surely be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become disproportionately expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: gasoline 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbo diesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
Gearbox - only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a tightly connected "forward".
It will be on the stand of Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere the representation of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minivan-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng range consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications on transport tax will stop sending by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the system that has not changed over the years: in the summer and autumn, they receive receipts for payment of transport tax for the previous year.
This year, however, many will not be able to attend.
The fact is that the tax inspection without too much noise changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal office of the taxpayer" on the official website of the department nalog.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically identified such Russians as online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing list.
The news will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All the others will still receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to the account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after compilation, while the letter will go a few days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on the mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in the "personal office" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the resulting consequences.
Access to the "Personal Office of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally at any tax inspection office (regardless of the place of registration).
We would like to remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the refinements are aimed at achieving a very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of G-Power, who took on the modification of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63 - 571-strong flying balloon with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helix", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 sec, and now the flying "brick" is able to break in 5.3 sec.
However, accelerations from medium speeds are certainly given him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km / h, then the tuning all-terrain vehicle with a deactivated electronic "collar" is able to push 250 km / h.
Outside, the car is virtually indistinguishable from its original factory source, with the exception of other wheel drives - the 23-inch Hurricane RR with a dimension of 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxury division has announced a stunning 6-metre-long concept coupe that will be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green sub-brand” of BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four environmental innovations are expected.
