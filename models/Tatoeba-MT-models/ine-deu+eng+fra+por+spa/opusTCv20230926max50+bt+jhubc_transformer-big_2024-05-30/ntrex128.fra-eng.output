Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about “passing for puppets”
Welsh elected officials are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the bill to amend the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be ridiculed.
One Labour electorate said his group is concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crow.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Part of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a change of name, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (puppet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, stated that "the final decision on the nomination of members of the Assembly belongs to the latter".
The 2007 Government of Wales Act (2017) gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission favours Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the question of the name in the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a very long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in Trouble, St. Martin's Bells Reduced to Silence
“The older people I talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams says.
“There are no more of them today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become rarer.
Nowadays, “we don’t get along the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like we used to go to our neighbor’s, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds coming from the sale of buildings will run out long before what the officials imagine, and this worries him: "Sooner or later, they will come back to the checkout."
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who won’t help maintain the neighborhood’s last sanctuaries.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be White people who will rush the closure of all the churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation preaching in the surrounding area took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops of 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which Blacks struggled to get employed or get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the church of St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave her an entirely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin has not replaced him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the house-running of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese wanted to impose the costs incurred, although it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners have deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-Year-Old Man Injured by Shark at Lobster Fishing Game
Authorities said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old on Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the season's opening.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming joy at having a catch, then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
Upon approaching the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
“I was screaming to get everyone out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is not known.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's handmade low on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnishes them with supermarket-like rays, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion aesthetics market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, wider beauty product rays will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience soars.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to up to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in sectors similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second is scheduled to open in Selly Oak (Birmingham) this year.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to make their online purchases and head to nearby grocery stores for daily groceries.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more and more like large stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to drive sales of consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetic items of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it came to an end following a controversy over the distribution of profits from supermarket pharmacies.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of premium skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty products has been modified to improve the environment for customers.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the embellishment of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance in the cosmetics market is now undisputed and changes purchasing habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger over Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones has announced the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract related to her home decor brand, to devote to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to take care of the Truly interior decoration and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
At the age of 37, the host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior decoration activity at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the beloved TV child revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the commercial empire of the star of Dragon's Den in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth 1.5 million pounds sterling, did not allow him to access them anymore.
The Truly brand was equated with that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside of Britain.
According to a source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It is about securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The Marlow Headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause millions to lose to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couple went on vacation together and Peter Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was hectic, but in the end we love each other
Trump mocked the media that criticized him for commenting that some deemed him “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give in so much?”
He laughed, taking a voice as a TV reporter.
“I have not given up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “correspondent response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” the US president said.
We have fought the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of American military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracks, there are just over 200 standing in front of me," he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: A devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no national disaster status has been decreed, a condition required for international aid to be triggered.
“Unfortunately, they have repeatedly made it clear that they do not want international aid, which complicates things a bit,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, she still does not know if field work will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant upheavals, the country lacks the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Refugees have been established in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm sirens rang at Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the sites of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed the collapsed infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to rehabilitate roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Joko's government, which is expected to stand in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes, amidst clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea goals, and his team was led 1–0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second pole.
The balloon flew above the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reaches Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to put myself in, to grab the ball, but players like Shaq are always pulling as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much, I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward scored a pass in the direction of Mateo Kovacic, before turning to the midfielder and sprinter side of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick come-and-go in the middle of the field,
Then he carried out a magnificent deep firing that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the record of the earthquake and tsunami reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that rocked the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbed woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman was found stabbed in Grayson Mews’ John Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who may have seen or heard anything to testify.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is barely beginning, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In particular, I call on the taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any information crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is underway and police said they were informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confided that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
Repeat, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were watching the building on the inside of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Failure anonymously at 0800 555 111, as indicated in Register 247 of September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
Cromwell Society president John Goldsmith said, “Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of Westminster Palace was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
Cromwell’s magnificent representation, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the consideration we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.”
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean of the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy to be underlined and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a pork market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighboring pork shop was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered in blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was neither the farmer's nor his cousin's.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid another incident and allow police officers to gather evidence.
The farmer's family, Mr. Yuan, and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks against people have already been reported.
In 2016, at a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig caught a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away.
In 2012, while an Oregon farmer had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re pretty playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rainfall in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and flows to the east, towards the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity from the United States to the northeast.
It will rain up to 25 cm in parts of Mexico this Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous sudden crusts, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to rain between 5 and 10 cm in parts of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Scattered tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rains could turn the canyons into unleashed rivers and storms will produce wind gusts and whirlwinds of dust from places to places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rainfall in some parts of the southern part of the country, on the California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the sliding shoe.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will reach Arizona on Sunday late in the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer significant temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm October start, with temperatures revolving around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
The multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be higher than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
The trial of Brett Kavanaugh attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the arresting hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political stalemate continues, broadcasters interrupted Friday’s usual program to announce a coup d’etat: an agreement conceived by Jeff Flake, the Arizona senator, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Christine Ford assured her 100% certainty that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had given himself to touching his person and had tried to remove his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate thriller, said he was also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people who watch TV in the office.
For comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on hearing day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
Following were CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not weaken once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the Moderate Republican office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken aside by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN relayed the live interception sequence.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” said one of the women.
“Do you really believe he’s telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are in need.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast channels covered the live session a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the accusations made against the candidate, which minority Democrats were demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by a discussion with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators later on.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance, as the Republicans would not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
UK: May Accuses Brexit Opponents of Doing ‘Little Politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, to make “little politics” to the detriment of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a cover photo of Theresa May, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, saying the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was “properly ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was stabbed and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton-Rouge parish coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, which determines that the death was caused by a bullet wound that crossed the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service acknowledges the assistance received from the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game during the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
“We fear this kind of event all the time,” Wade regretted.
Mexico: a volcano spits out ashes
From the ash leaking from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended Mexicans to move away from the volcano, after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several roars and tremors coming from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano 72 km from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Clashes between police and separatists on the approach of the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colorful powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not fill tourists.
Shots also broke out later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forget nor forgive” faced union supporters shouting “long live Spain”.
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain strong in the independentist region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with secessionists largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
This took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he had no hope of independence from Catalonia.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a deadlock,” he said.
Despite their maiden, albeit slim, victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained while waiting to be tried for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the police support demonstration on his phone, believes politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, both on the one hand and on the other.
“The tension is only rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house in a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly stalking a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also shot with arrows.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently in the ranks, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to rank 2nd in the standings, on an equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premier League this season, and are due to face the Hearts team, which leads by 8 points, on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends by 6 games its undefeated track in the division, and its head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may be proud to have not lost a single match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in front of mute opponents
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to drill but remained stuck in front of the opponent's goal; he was followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a lead by Craig Halkett.
Livingston's team was letting the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could interfere with them through hard-working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half experienced the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers keeper Allan McGregor halted Scott Pittman's strike, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston keeper repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation against Glenn Middleton and the other for a mishand.
The "phenomenon" of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this uphill slope.
Their style and team composition have practically not changed since their return to the top, but the merit largely goes back to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
which counts many great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in breath throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they have not been up to their past talent.
They missed a last chance and only managed to pierce the opposing side once; this is a warning to the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the board.
President Erdogan's mixed welcome to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 demonstrators from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to spot their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan’s double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a car crash.
The accident occurred around 10:15 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on the spot, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and warn his or her family.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been put in place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured in riot
The high-security men's prison official said six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialized riot agents were dispatched to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences prolonged.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police officers were sent to the prison to prevent a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Hurricane Rosa heads to the southwestern desert with what's left of energy. This region could be affected by sudden rains.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with predictive rains starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per spot in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rainfall could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least one extreme category drought, the second most severe category,” weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey along the coast of the Lower California Peninsula.
Still high on Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and will be able to reach up to 25 cm,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Flowering rains are expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly sudden rains and debris spills in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4 a.m. local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Sommerset police said they arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on Radstock's side.
Officers called on people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Has Been Victim of Democratic Evil and Anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress Thursday, energetically and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” on this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in the public service,” he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party employee's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them from huge waves that crashed on beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six meters high flooded the beach at dusk, taking many lives and destroying everything on their way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, homes, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Air images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the debris of ruined buildings, he added, specifying that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications have been “completely paralyzed” since Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to disseminate information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building screaming freneticly at passersby on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall collapsed on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to dispatch aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of the rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami rises to more than 800.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived safe and sound in Palu, where they found refuge in tarpaulin shelters set up in the yard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, explains Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to provide relief to those affected, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares it a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
On Saturday, a small boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a veteran in the paragliding discipline, I have lived my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paraglider community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages were left unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when recharging a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police service.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly spotted many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name and became Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled her arrival for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“Then I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, of everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union line and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco’s square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by awarding monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its funding for research in this sector, according to investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the U.S.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are ahead of the United States, and we’re looking at the next big discovery in AI,” Lee said.
Double the funds could double the odds that the next key step in AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined the executive team at Microsoft Reasearch and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that owns academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited top academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he says.
The State Affairs Council of China unveiled its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academia partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In parallel, the U.S. legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's request to join the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces of which is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that it can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. It means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, when it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the election.
“I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments, with the unemployment rate in the country exceeding 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his bulletin.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would have planned to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of those who intend to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday, at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before plunging into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before evicting the others close to the goal of Brighton.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the Premier League match,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the field of Brighton.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few keys before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues forward sent the ball into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if this game is not a game, we want to step on the pitch in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals are yet to announce a launcher departing for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave room for Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
Washington’s right-hander is 18-7 with an average score of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major challenge. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “annoyed, vicious, and lying.”
He spoke to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public attention.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I expect one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were during my eight years as a Labour Party MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has ever been taken into account.
It has become apparent that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took power, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to return my jacket and take positions contrary to my beliefs, whether it was about national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I said, I was following an abusive social media bulletin, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were made to me were political in nature.
I am in admiration for the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flurry of sexist or racist talk every day, but who do not shrug their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in current politics is the standardization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is confined to the motions of distrust and amendments to the rules of selection.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years: lower my eyes, not express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But this is not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse. Since then, I have been eager to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and by my disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and utilities. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Nottingham East constituency.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remained undefeated
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match day of the 15th Scottish Rugby Championship.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this game.
“Until now, we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to be happy!” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers. Jason Baggot took over an untransformed rehearsal.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just halftime. He scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
A long wait followed due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a sledgehammer. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's interim captain, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tempted his luck with an unprocessed essay by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the penalty kick, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's butt, which progressed.
Climo transformed the rehearsal, as almost every time since the rehearsal, after Kyle Rowe assembled David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth home rehearsal.
Still Game star launches into restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-hosts with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series coming up will be the end of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "blooming restoration environment" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored boat in the naval headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings bear a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: “The sea is ours.
Getting it back is a duty.”
Throughout blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well-present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision was made.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have hurt it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision was abnormally fast.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems about to revive nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it’s “chemical” to think that maintaining sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness about renouncing an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows unveil the latest trends in quilts, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself 100% from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delirious oversize hats during a PE19 parade that honored the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry-clad watermelon, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation looked like a diving gear, with tub and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cone.
And if you follow the trends of fashion, then you are lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come as far as your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the footsteps of the “Bomba”, the wide-bodied straw hat that the stars rip off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that sells this hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag made of straw almost as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, adorned with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the parade PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus during the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The designer has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they have chosen and for themselves as world citizens.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and establish a trusted bond with residents of other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in this year's exams, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates among independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as are science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 UK Commission on Employment and Skills survey found that 17% of employers’ difficulties in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from this lasting skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with strangers will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not have sufficient knowledge of a foreign language to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important to the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that today, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Saturday.
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James’ debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the pre-season opening.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few limited minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the vacancy confirmation vote in the Supreme Court postponed, Trump seeks to gather support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the question of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, hearings that took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed until a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims above all to help Republicans gain ground in the run-up to the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential part of his program that the president will visit as many states as possible at the start of this charged election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope on Sunday’s simple approach
After three simple, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is a sporty concept invented of all pieces but in which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during tournaments like this one.
So where would they find the momentum now?
“They were six points ahead and now four, so that gives us a little bit of wings,” Spieth said as he returned for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in the air and have every reason to be encouraged, notably by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can pride themselves on getting three out of four points each.
Spieth has proven terribly effective from tee to green and sets an example.
Energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize to the fourth half while Thomas and him were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match in the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in the race.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the Ryder Cup history attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and has no right to mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the crowd deludes them as players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fork, while teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the nine first shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never able to come out of.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you.
Forks and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and the ones they don’t, and how a strategy can swing at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead over the past day, but this foursome session has also proven that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's forks and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made a difference by scoring 3-1 in the morning forks against a cluttered American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to absorb the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight out of 12 points on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed “Molliwood” after a failed weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair consisting of American debutant Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself during both games on Saturday, shone a few times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in forks and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning forks, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, under a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, these having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's crown-holder team has no more than a draw to keep their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament can in no case be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions was strengthening his mistrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known accusations of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of a past denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected demands for easing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and accentuate the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the "end of war declaration."
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us rain don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings that took place between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a state.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone of speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea before the United Nations, did not laud this year for the courage with which Kim applied measures for disarmament, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea does.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Lessons
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
In the end, a student approached me and said, “Why is this only being told to me in the last year?”
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Delivered for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding students suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information – just as you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in “passing a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of starvation, making them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and prompted him to insist that it be offered throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar degree program before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to provide an alarm for both bedtime and waking time, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first moving win since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team drifting eight points behind the Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston rises to third position, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11 who took a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team choke his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-mate defender Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalized after the free kick when Steven Lawless and him collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If the opening of the score by Livi in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs's stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold-blooded to choose Menga for an end all in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted in the middle by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few moments, but McGregor managed to push Jacobs away before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOUR COMPUTER... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
“Through these headphones, we can really hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “So tell me, it sure jumps there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Allows Immune System to “Detect” Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Allows Immune System to “Detect” Cancer Cells and Kill Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to “learn” them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Haired with a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after his move to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West got bullied on stage after a wild performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced he would run for office in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West grabbed the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if racism worries me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to mock West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a hole," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see him, the pit?" and claimed that he would wear his superman cloak, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
His comments attracted him at least twice as much of the public and the members of the NLS seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on the spot told the magazine: "A deadly silence has fallen on the entire plateau."
West had been called to replace last-minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West disguised a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous minds: THANK YOU FOR BEING HEADED.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “faithful to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying their music, their clothes or supporting their art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince Fire, which changed its name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Indicted for attempted murder after a white-arms attack in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
Prosecutors will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor has taken on the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this kind of role on the screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard-working to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star, confessed that he was “strongly” keen to tackle the issue.
“Personally, I deeply believe that we have undermined masculinity.”
“What lessons have we given to young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that arises now?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys who make them think they have to behave that way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong with it.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and the horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie’s family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious issue.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed data relating to senators, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by a stranger at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the White House’s former press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not challenge the prosecution's grounds.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “law enforcement authorities and agencies” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are exposed,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English has hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, sub-doped spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satisfied question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with crisp eyes and a rubber face, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context – this name indicates above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinemaphile audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Carts of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was also inspired by the traveler and man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathetic moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter as he wore a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with the comedy.
Humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and for me, Johnny English’s far-fetched misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in Bean’s character.
The perpetual premise of topicality is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great dismay of the agents on duty – an unfortunately small-scale role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character almost Teresa-May, but there is not much to put under the denture.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy who has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that you have to bother Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolteacher, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice jokes here, because English proposes an academy of espionage way Rock Academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-time partner, again encamped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create big trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farceful jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a sparkling French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English unleashes a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of the house.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there’s a lot for the kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: Can the British film industry not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan for the British to work for four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still getting the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country towards workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not be done overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details about his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "anonymous administrators" and "beneficiaries" in public utility companies.
The deputy chancellor’s plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their entire stake as the Labour government could operate “deductions” due to alleged diverging conduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of private company capital to employees, who will pocket up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say 60 Minutes would be a good time if the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for the “60 Minutes” program, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, determined, unmistakable.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive star chart and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise public awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling on the phone, or making any other useful effort to raise public awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convincing them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clickivism” – a situation in which people really think of making a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped incentivize global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a instalment of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executives who have pledged to “help children develop their full potential,” while promising to help Rwanda with <0xC2><0xA3>35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve mother and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children as part of nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. could call on Navy to create “blockade” to hamper Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Washington may “if necessary” call on the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States, with our Navy, can ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruction to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “speaker of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope at its arc” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is committed to boosting exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow has stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in September in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States aroused negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Seriously Consider Applying for the 2020 Presidential Election, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president in the wake of the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be thinking of introducing herself.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be on top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that she should come forward in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democrat names for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can link him to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the public at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "taboo subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a bit different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and members of the air force, and each other military, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla police, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all applications for asylum must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in its memoir.
Lawyers also argued in the memoir that the policy of refusing entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never been designed to mitigate all the problems – even the most serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center of the emptied city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up wet goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “intimidation” through “propaganda ads”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page ad boasting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the surcharge paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China refutes.
Accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump said what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to impose reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s tariff measures aimed to hit exporters from states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion paper published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at Beijing’s press booth, you will find few protesting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, because the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating electors as midterm elections approach due to Kavanaugh's debacle
While many senior Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, said “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation would be enough to calm voter anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reported, protesters chanted "The month of November is coming!" in the Senate corridor while Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be disproportionate,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But that could be even higher, especially among suburban electors and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested the reaction would be lively if Republicans pushed the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that “it has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s about Kavanaugh’s appointment, it’s about how Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of both parties, with a small majority leaning on the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of people surveyed believed absolutely or probably Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh likely or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s Solid free platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is backed up and who is allowed to access this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aiming to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal liability via data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings the appropriate resources, processes, and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team and he are not yet in talks with “Facebook and Google” to see if a complete change is needed where all their business models are completely blurred in an instant.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee writes that “[Inrupt’s] mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I ecclesiastical decorated with the Cross of Victoria
The only Church of England ecclesiastical to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to the London Gazate, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of country guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greater bravery", guided the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and bewildering three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite sniper killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I will never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be brought to him by many people.”
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main page, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied with staying awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the move to children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the transmission, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation states that at 6 a.m. this content was not suitable, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you it won't happen next time.
We’re going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more to the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling ‘Lower’ in Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that infused him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before he went to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck in Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
“Even today, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed for my success.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The Olympic double bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was expressing himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The triple world champion has said he "doesn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he says confidently that it was difficult to find a person of the same age having experienced the same highs and lows.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If you had questioned me last year, I only thought about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not agreed that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he was dead so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“That’s all I’ve dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, this inspired his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 am, BST.
An out-of-form Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to straighten up to avoid it being an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's forks and forks.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and refining his stand-up game in order to remedy his pain.
He has never been the greatest of the leaders, even at the height of his career. At 48 years old, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the lost kicks.
And as if the race wasn’t scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, take a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has great confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like he did this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I planned more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the largest number of Ryder Cup matches ever played.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven innings, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun measuring up to him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon go away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we were leading widely to Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but of course,” said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at 10-6 at the National Golf Men.
History will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom of it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do what you need to do.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that’s what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted by the performance of his players on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never make any progress on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it will be different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test at your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to the players, it is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these last-day reversals, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the outcome of the "Miracle of Medina", where Europe took the victory.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we had to do, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I’ve accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said of his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the all-new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the ports of call.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the avant-garde warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it was delivered.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless in the event of deployment in combat missions.
Software defects were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, the ship appears to be significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), compared to 2.2 billion at the beginning.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact "lacking ships capable of deploying".
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were declassified but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special check-in devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat screams as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perch and results in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, just like fly-kill papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only stock of Scottish bats at the Threave site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the domain manager, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have an ideal place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we’re doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying without it a single maternity nest, it can cause the death of 400 females and small ones, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “false information” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations spread, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“They want to get publicity by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they called “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the area of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek reparation for “moral damages of an amount proportional to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel-casino le Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him he was a "99% good guy" but he didn't know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they were consenting.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a settlement amicably because she felt “terrified by reprisals” and feared “to suffer public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to revoke the regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve under a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK “would forever regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Secretary of State for Trade Greg Clark, the UK would “regret forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fear of leaving the EU without a deal on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what automakers call a supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tensioned flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-built vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will, as I said, not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity,” he said in the BBC’s Radio 4’s Today show.
“The obvious thing, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent supply chain set.”
If Toyota was not able to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the union coordinator for Unite at the plant and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said his members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The White House announces that the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein could still be delayed
According to the announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred by a week", while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump’s associates and Russia, and the possible obstacles to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will send back the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he appeared at the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Commission hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we could postpone another week given all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has held no press conference at the White House.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the conferences was not due to an aversion to “demagogical” television reporters, although she said, “I have nothing against them shaking the gallery.”
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it often, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for him to give press conferences alone.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and sometimes a strange appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Regarding Brexit concerns, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on the withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of no agreement.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ of the Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second-place finisher, underwent emergency surgery after a head injury Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores' 31-27 defeat.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came on the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a cage and taking it through another examination.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room of the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was "no clarity on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five sets in total on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 sets.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This measure will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This will be seen as an initiative to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-residents in the UK, which raises prices and prevents first-accessors from gaining a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right to stamp in order to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using it, he urged May to give up affordable housing quotas in order to settle the “real estate misfortune” that is raging in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive set of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of “faultless” evictions.
It also wants to give councils broader powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I declared that I would dedicate my post of prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that each new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our market of broken housing.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals not resident in the UK, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in Ligue 1, three points ahead of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland’s Hampden games with my father and that’s something I never forgot.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only present itself if I succeed in the management of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician says he has not hesitated to rank behind such iconic names in such a large club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I probably wouldn’t consider myself a success here unless I manage to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of coaching career, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months with the Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa climb from relegation to third division and turned St. Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The taking over of Alloa “was undoubtedly a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I got along well, I was making a good living and I took advantage of some appreciable peaks.
But sometimes playing is difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is great for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been all my adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer’s hectic weather has pushed up the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's board of directors, which compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation made July the model of June, where bars had seen a 2.8% increase, except for restaurants, which have seen a further significant drop in the number of restaurants.
The 1.8% decline in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than down-swinging restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM Hospitality and Leisure Analyst, said: “These results follow the trend seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is no surprise that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although a drop in annual average sales of 4.8% is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing pressure on costs.
The long and warm summer could not have been less opportune for food industry operators and the weather will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will grant a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in settlement.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK's pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children have secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news accentuated concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - opens a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “false Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they managed a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally stumbled onto the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers don’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to leverage their vast experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from his participation in the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m Olympics in Atlanta where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a strenuous job, but I recovered completely, I re-learned to walk and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Online, an ad on the milkshake that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online ad from a company offering a milkshake compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
To mark the launch of what’s called the “world’s first silent milkspray,” Elvie, a consumer tech company, has launched a bold ad inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom its new milkspray offers breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn full of hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I betray myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t notice it, it’s my breasts, not my nipples.”
The refrain continues: “Pump it, pump it, I’m feeding the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I’m helping the women who are feeding the milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"It's a worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is understandable trauma for the mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others defended the advertisement, such as a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun ad for moms who pull their milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal to have danced with the discreet milkshots hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milkshake say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milkshake is completely silent, without wires or pipes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even come out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and DPE at Mother commented: “Elvie’s milkshake is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
Making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk extractor will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milkshake has made it one of the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies that have complicated child placements among respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and they feared compromising their own ability to stay in the country by carrying out a child rescue.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no legal history.
“Nearly 80% of people who are respondents or members of their families are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the norm.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be quickly expelled.
According to speakers and reports submitted in recent months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or escape attempts.
In a large establishment like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to immediately withdraw.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in this country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “conduct this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of both terrorist groups and of any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which form and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this country ravaged by war, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said about the refugees, that the conditions were favorable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “propagating irrational concerns” that discouraged refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have said that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is concluded.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib’s last rebel fortress has allowed political negotiations to progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for “definite deadlines” and expressed hope that military measures would target jihadists, in particular fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be “The most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at major evenings, is the first cable TV channel.
“It’s a matter that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of ABC’s drama series “Designated Survivor,” which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a few irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, contrary to everything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds herself watching for six hours a panel of experts debating how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear", on Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich jacket.
I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he does gives the impression of seeing a reality TV show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s changing teams and daily situational shifts.
You can't afford to miss an episode unless you're behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the north bank of Kauai, but he landed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not detach himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a realignment of Congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to dispute the same seat.
This suburban Pittsburgh district, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is matched by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district sparked a clash over the funding of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won in fairness last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington little objected.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only planned against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide it with development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings continued, representatives of North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice. The public file is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a connivance of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congressional control changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to represent himself to the electorate and, perhaps, to a jury of his peers.
There are many “if”s there, and I’m not claiming that Trump’s fall is inevitable—not even that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to secretly register the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recent investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienne
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve exploits.
“It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We got into the game thinking of getting something and we went back with a point.
We could have won it in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last game, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year has been really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind and triumph.”
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be taken care of, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t do what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buy-back hybrid life insurance policy to help cover those expenses, or other insurance on your estate — provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in passing.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will check your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your bills if you are struck by incapacity.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
A man was wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe

The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. TSB, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the balance sheet is expected to rise.
As communications were paralyzed, the emergency services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that spans more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, and particularly of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Earthquake Circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake rocked the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, in violation of a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in custody at the Mat-Su detention centre and is detained under unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, of course" when his plea was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and is liable to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the quake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the balance sheet of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu at the time of the tsunami on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a person suspected of terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who made eight victims - a rare sentence that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, stumbling on his pedestrian and cyclist route last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the aggression, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 charges, including eight murder charges for extortion of funds, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “a careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The southern district of New York had not demanded the death penalty in the course of prosecutions for ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court records.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he had been incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to seek prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment without possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all interested parties,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Backward-ban Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would “already have been freed” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been underlined by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has a hard time maintaining Chequers’ compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to remain so as well as the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities – and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its program and “chaos.”
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out already,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We have not engaged in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, and so is our party and our activists who sit on the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Abandon Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be led to “feel the pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to fool Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We’re not going to let you get out of it like that.”
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you felt the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing this country’s popular army that has enabled us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists brandished conservative banners against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives over security concerns about the party's application at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a real joke.
A good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of submitting to the presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP’s representative in the states, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state.”
Arrest during the shooting death of Sims at Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared on the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Questioned, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as he left last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads for world title after the team’s guidelines allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and crawled Hamilton on the side as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel stepped into the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the turmoil behind the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands a lap later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inner part at the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speedy arrival and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually reached the stands in the 44th round, but was unable to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job of getting a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly evoke Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “bad, disgusting, and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information -- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter last July from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’ll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the messiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped out Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the tie back home before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, assuring them the victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being caught.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a well-charged first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put himself at Cownie's service, at 15:16, with a tie.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team got together and Bouchard once again tied with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee at the top for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing his team’s victory by scoring a fifth goal in the middle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people who were on board a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to abandon his position in the violently shaken tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn that,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The record would continue to rise as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves measuring up to six meters ravaged Palu, which will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that a man has disappeared after a plane crashes in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that was flown.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she has not been able to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others could have slipped into the water to the rescue exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed that the officers on board panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning alive a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the defendant died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' home while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “[lies] because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’s text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother complaining that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her consternation by noting in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gaffe, “uncomfortable,” Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, explaining to her that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was instead waiting for a Philippines.
Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for their dismissal and is claiming $350 a day for the six-month home service for which it was originally hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Maurice’s employment, fearing that they could not trust him after they had wronged him.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assuming the trial was “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you chase someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still pending, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Identify a Speaking Bear, New Letter Reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to replace someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a little teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had had a "sweet-bitter" flavour after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds at something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad was calling regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect her to get away with it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly exhausting and coming out of his system.
She had died a while ago and everything had stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep up.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the trial she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid that there’s a training effect.”
Ms. Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they have to cope: “It’s tearing up the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - we might be able to bring some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "collapse" into partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, i.e. on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans score a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and, through him, met his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to separate the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: The number of deserters "fall" under the leadership of Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcefully repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had so far been pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman behaved in this way, they would have called her “hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes nearly screamed and choked while evoking his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he treated Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit in the court where he’s currently sitting,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh circumvented the question of the possible overturn of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect what we were saying: ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it can't get her out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, and you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was framed somewhere, who told me she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to when she was angry and crying, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a source of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with an inexpressible rage, was that I had been seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman — a cold director who had always terrified me — who had dragged me into a little bit of a scary one.
“Don’t let them see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe you are sad and are delighted because they have had you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic MP from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Somebody called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in raising funds, and therefore vowed that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave men $1,000 only intended to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous depression,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
“You would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first salve of the trade war between the United States and China has been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of items, taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in kind, hitting tariffs of 5-10% on $60 billion of US goods recently.
China has committed to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will swing anytime soon.
To push Washington back is to give in to the demands, but to publicly give in to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the foreign minister
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, shoved his start in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the European team's least-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles, last Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've given up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to come together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow.
We were overwhelmed.”
Red tide info point: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties – which raise fears of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
There are islets about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
