Members of the Welsh congregation worry that they are “like Muppets”
Some members of the Assembly were appalled at the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum worry that they will be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour congregation said they were concerned about their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means cockatiel.
A member of the assembly from the Plaid Cymru party said their group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested other options.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about changing the name, while noting that there was little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly’s Commission, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will of course have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Assembly was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
The Commission chose the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’ for the members of the Assembly, but the most support was given to the option ‘MWP’ during the public consultation.
Members of the House are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who has to submit a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of members of the Assembly and the formation of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their nomination.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as the churches in Harlem are struggling.
“The older people I’ve talked to say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently nowadays.
Bars are no longer the living room of neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
In the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back at the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced with residential buildings with a joint administration (condominiums), where people will live, who will not help the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, because people who will move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist ecclesiastical community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that performed worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin’s was taken over by the black religious community under the leadership of the venerable John Howard Johnson, who, on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, led a boycott of vendors who refused to hire or support black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they ordered ringing bells.
The Venerable David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “bells for the poor.”
The expert, who arrived in July, called them a little differently: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that these were the first bells to be ringed by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago to ring larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin’s Church.
The St. Martin’s Church has a complicated history with architects and contractors over the last few months; some have been brought in by church laymen and others by the diocese.
Zakristia, the administrative body of the parish, composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July that she was concerned that the diocese would “try to transfer costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old While Hunting Lobsters in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old in California on Saturday while hunting lobster at the start of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help, and then he and the group swam up to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just thrilled because he caught the lobster, then he found out that he was yelling, “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had the whole key ripped apart.
“I called out to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
A water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of the carcass.
For 48 hours, they have blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty corners they have in stores and with professional staff.
As part of entering the UK beauty market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and still growing as sales of clothing and household appliances decline, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and next year in more stores if they prove successful.
They chose to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill up the shelves they used to use for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say they will double the range of their beauty products to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, so most products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping for smaller amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight Alda and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s Group has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores as well as Habitat stores since it bought both chains two years ago, increasing food sales and making takeovers more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to renovate their departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s began a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the relationship ended after a dispute over profit sharing from drug stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical company to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play its part in this plan by expanding the range of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty corners to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's retirement from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The star of Dragons Day is furious that TV host Holly Willoughby has stepped down from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand of clothes and accessories Truly.
The business couple company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning star has announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons star Den Peter Jones as she withdrew from their lucrative lifestyle brand deal at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television's golden girl admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to his new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - he no longer had enough time to dedicate himself to their brand of clothing.
The company was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and announced that it would double its assets, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would survive the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely disappoints everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening, because the opening was so close.
At the company headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the most interesting ties for banks in Britain, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappo in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
In addition, Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the media’s criticism of the comment, which some consider “non-presidential” and the positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, in his ridiculous “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a U.N. General Assembly meeting that North Korea did not see a “appropriate response” from the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He pointed out that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they stopped testing missiles, helped free hostages and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded, crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
For example, in addressing the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for sending international aid.
“In many cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is a bit complicated,” Sumbungová said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes are a constant in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, this is not a common practice on other shores.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge, even at the best of times.
Due to natural disasters, logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for Jokov’s administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces the pressure of long-standing tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores for late tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the English Premier League with an 89th minute hit.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's pass a good 25 yards ahead of Chelsea's 1-0 behind his team.
He turned the ball to his left and fired a shot at the far-off gate.
The shot traveled high above the penal area towards the upper right corner of the door.
The ball eventually dropped through the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch, I didn’t think much about it and just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in halftime with the beating of Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The striker of the blues in this action with the fifth handed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he passed through the defense nicely and Hazard ran into the courtroom.
Hazard overtook the defense and fired with his left leg at the remote gate through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will host Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings following Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which triggered a six-metre wave.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with ruins of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
Police have launched an investigation into the murder after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on everyone who has been in the area and has seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its initial stages, but I urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera footage of a car, to get in touch with us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene of the crime and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police are informing the women's families.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told that it may take several hours before they can re-enter.
A police officer was heard explaining to a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another was immediately outside it.
Many policemen stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone who has any information requests to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with a diary 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has become the latest memorial target of the "rewriting of history" dispute
Its removal would be a poetic right to the destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s discussion of the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.”
Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell neither commissioned nor executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor of the last century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of a personality that some believe is still worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course monarchies.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time of Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.”
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media, at a market in the southwest of China, a pig attacked and killed a farmer.
A man identified only with the surname "Yuan" was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pig market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pigs are preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
She and her cousin traveled from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the swine herd with a bloody sponge.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig killed a farmer to death.
“Cousin’s legs were bloody and crushed,” a cousin named Wu told the Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from the security camera showed that Yuang came to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so as not to attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are expected to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of porcine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious bodily injury.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Welsh farmer by a tractor, but then the woman drove the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“We were just playing.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them enough respect,” he said.
Southwestern U.S. receives heavy rains from hurricane Rosa
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to move toward the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weaken.
However, Rosa will bring floods in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure is strengthening, moving east towards the U.S. west coast. Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, pushing high tropical moisture north to the southwest of the U.S.
In parts of Mexico, the rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, which will mix with the low-pressure area, will create abundant precipitation in the broader southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of precipitation in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over most of Arizona, rainfall is expected from 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local heavy winds and dust in the air.
The approaching low air pressure zone will bring local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Precipitations above 12 mm are possible, which can result in less flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical plains will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoon and on Monday early in the morning, and rainfall will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In the United States, temperature fluctuations can occur in October as the Arctic cools down and the tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
There is a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to settle and expand again.
Most of the Middle and Eastern U.S. will enter a warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, we could have 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for above-average temperatures for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have mirrored Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched Thursday's interesting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday’s last-minute reversal: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched her in a guilty state and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
In a tumultuous testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people are expected to see the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that played the testimonial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting viewers who watch the program in the offices.
For the sake of clarity, the spectatorship is similar to that of playing a football match finale or awarding an American Film Academy award.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads all networks in the broadcast of a full-day hearing with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen reports.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS on Friday morning filmed protesters yelling at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend a hearing by the Justice Committee.
During the construction, he hung up a glance for a few minutes, which was captured live by CNN’s cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had made a statement, adding that he would say more at the board’s hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks also aired live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate next week, which was urged by the Democratic minority party.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing political games' at Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with the UK's future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay each other customs was “absolutely absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost their sunglasses during the fight.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television supplements WAFB television reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to having shot Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, according to the lawyer.
An observer from East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police are thanking the Louisiana State Police Refugee Special Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “care and search for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what you’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano burns ash in Mexico City
The ash vomited by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified and recorded 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.
The center has observed several instances of thunder and earthquake shocks.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that covered the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of the capital city of Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with counter-insurgency police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized secession vote.
A group of disguised supporters of separatism, detained by counter-terror police units, swept them with eggs and dust paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which were usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were clashes, and the police had to use a pendulum to stop the clashes.
Proponents of independence, who shouted for hours “without forgetting, without forgiving,” confronted protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media, 14 people were injured more easily in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum in Madrid, which was declared illegal and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain in the region that supports independence.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low, as opponents of the secession largely boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt the resumption of voting in the region's polling stations in violent clashes.
Groups supporting independence camped in front of polling stations overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the important, albeit close victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties supporting independence have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the best-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of police, said the protest was sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is escalating,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested Men Who Crawled Into House by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car was shot with a shotgun.
With Mengaj's hit, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga scores first goal for Livingston
Livingston impressed the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as the coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team equalized the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard’s team was thus left without a guest win in this year’s championship, and next Sunday they are expected by Hearts, leading the ladder and lagging behind by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his division defeat to six games and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston wasted opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should have led well before the hit, as they caused a lot of problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he sent the ball across the neck frame, then Alan Lithgow struck through the neck, and Craig Halkett shot his head across the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, knowing that they could be dangerous to guests during interruptions in the attack.
And that’s how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and struck from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but the home defense could not break through and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor fired Scott Pittman with his foot, and Lithgow shot through the goal from another Livingston interruption in the attack.
The drafts continued to come to Livingston’s penal area, but the homers rejected all attacks, and the judge did not convict two offenses—Halkett’s offense of replacing Glenn Middleton and the offense of playing with his hand.
Livingston's "Excellent Show" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
They have all been great and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the character have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt must be credited for the way he has awakened the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and deployed a well-organized defense while keeping Menga on alert all the time with Connor Goldson and Joe Worll.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under the leadership of Gerrard, these standards are greatly lacking.
There was a shortage of shots to the goal – only once they successfully defeated the defense of the hosts – and this is a kind of wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, who do not support Erdogan’s government and condemned Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to greet him in the country, also expressed their opinion.
The opposing protests reflect the segregation regarding the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died in a car crash
In London, a cyclist was killed in a car accident.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred just a few months after the cyclist died in a crash in which the driver of the car escaped, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
Police said police are verifying the man’s identity so they can notify the family.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Accident
Six prison guards were injured in the incident in a tightly guarded man’s prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time and is still ongoing.
Police have called specialists from the Tornado unit to take care of the incident, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
The prison staff representative said: “We have called specially trained personnel to handle the outbreak in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were injured in the incident.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and they may be behind bars even longer.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-terror police unit was summoned to prison to intervene in a serious incident in which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for drought areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa paves its way through the southwest desert and brings the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday, but it will be approaching late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged a good 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitations of up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin, are expected to have 25 to 50 mm of precipitation, with individual precipitation up to 100 mm possible.
For areas outside the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as the southwest is currently undergoing a dry season.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, a good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least extreme drought,” weather.com reported.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the mainland of Mexico will reach with the strength of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitations in parts of Mexico can be plentiful and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with the possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and towards southern Utah until late at night on Tuesday.
"The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is abundant rainfall on the Baja California Peninsula in northwestern Sonora and in the American southwestern desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found at the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are calling on anyone who may have caught the incident using a mobile phone to come forward.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “Suffered Unfriendliness and Anger” of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the relentlessness and unprecedented tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the hostility and anger" of the Democratic party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
She also testified to Ford's allegations at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality, and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he talked about the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really working on the candidacy,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican party adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of whom were carried away by huge waves rushing along the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the town of Palu when six-metre waves struck the coast in the dark, taking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, told a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he was dragging cars, trees, houses, knocking everything down," Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to sweep the coastal town on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people have experienced a series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely interrupted and they have no information from the Donggal area.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the upper floor screams to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collided with the coast and took buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseba, members of World Vision from Donggala safely arrived in Palu, where the employees in the yard in front of their premises set up a shelter from the meadows, but they saw many scenes of devastation along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that they did not allow foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience to come to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, overseas funding, stockpiles and staff assistance are only allowed if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is still being treated as an accident at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hold the hope that their nearest miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
A boy was pulled from the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days, with her mother’s body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian paragliding team’s coach, has been training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others, trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As a sailing mayor, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalls how in the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated through the community of paratroopers, he sent messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors in Palu who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray tick, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Filling ATMs in Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police, the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security worker who filled an ATM in the Newport on the Leeve center on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was employed, another man “approached the Brink’s security employee from behind” and stole a bag of cash for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects flee from the scene, but police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone who has information on the identities of the suspects should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “A Being with the Official Name of Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his performance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace Ariano Grande, who canceled the show for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, speaking to radio host Big Boy about the album’s title.
“I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” I turned into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West’s former colleague, also used his name differently; with or without thought and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements began to operate in Latin America, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly grants to students and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal associations.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the U.S. and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence will happen in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of SinoVation Ventures, which has invested in one of the smartest, most visible kits in the world.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked U.S. player in the Othello game, later serving as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of China's Google subsidiary.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government tech competitions, such as a robotics competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be easier to find next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that immigration policy changes could help the U.S. intensify efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should automatically offer people with a PhD in artificial intelligence a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, bringing together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrower Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, hasn’t done anything for months.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that opposed their request to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to their territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
Governments reached a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 percent as necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting a deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote because of my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko handed over their ballots for a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country, paving the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small parade and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring a much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after delivering his ballot.
He added that the positive result would be “a confirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is less than the required electoral turnout.
A second survey conducted by Macedonian television, Telma, showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy, which took office last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero lost all of Brighton's defense and scored
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero's hit in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker took a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between the three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's prison.
Then he turned Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English striker returned the ball to Aguero, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is dealing with problems in his legs,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal in that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Blue Sons an initial advantage in the first English League duel.
He scored a goal in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep on Brighton's half.
Leroy Sane handed the ball to the left.
Sane touched the ball a few times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the remote gate.
The blue-blue striker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals team has fallen out of the finals, so there's no particular reason for another attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes he will be able to climb the pitcher's hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final, as they have an advantage in the Western League over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but are still awaiting their first title in the division.
“Although we can’t win anything, we will at least be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of the big crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the name of the first pitcher for Sunday, but in this case it will probably be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first to do so for the 34th time, was a heavy metal player on Thursday and would have had enough days off by Sunday.
Washington's right-hander has collected 18 wins and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 knockouts in 220 2/3 sweeps this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the supreme court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It will be one of the biggest – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening now.
They are determined to regain power, using all possible means. You can see ruthlessness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, for that is what they want, power and control, but we will not give it to them.”
According to him, the Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“And you may have noticed that in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “angry, vicious, lowly, and lying.”
He nominated a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. It was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, it is impatient.
When the momentum activist in my local party expressed his mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are not welcome to express their opinion.
My fellow Members, Joan Ryan, did the same because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of censure for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a notice for Friday’s meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party, it said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In the eight years that I have been a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday meetings have been mostly exactly like this.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings do not use such a tone, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if ever it started.
It is increasingly apparent that different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and it is assessed with each opinion whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues I previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my opinion and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether in the area of national security or the EU Single Market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks that call for no choice, condemn the politics of the middle and tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are merely political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not allow themselves to be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of policy is how rates of abuse have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each motion of no-confidence or change in the rules for the selection of the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the last two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not be so loud, and I’m going to be “all right.”
I didn’t get into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which literally collapsed the classroom in my elementary school – as a local saint or government minister, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas on which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of ineligibility or political suitability will dissuade me from acting in the best interests of all.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament from Nottingham East.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr to the top of the ladder
Two late attempts slightly distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully fun championship game of the day.
They are now at the top of the rankings and are the only unbeaten team out of ten.
In the end, the scales were moved to the home side by their superior defense and better use of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
“We have passed a lot of tests in our races so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ayra, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute strike by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, meant a numerical override for Melrose and Jason Baggott made the attempt without a conversion.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr on the offense, before hitting right at halftime, and then converted the stand-alone attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, who converted him to Baggot, reduced the lag to five points.
It was followed by a long pause due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on the stretcher, and afterwards Ayr made progress with Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert him to Climo.
Temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose re-used the player game with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing the Climate without a ball, MacPherson hit in the attack.
Climo reached a point after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent wing player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the hosts.
The star of the Still Game series starts a new career in the hospitality industry
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran is apparently going to the catering,it is supposed to become the director of a licensed company with restaurants.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis together with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that after the upcoming ninth season is the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but the source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan wants to join the "flowering catering" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
There are navy blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of coastline in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – just as the craving for a re-float across the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the greatest now after decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the international court, which will receive it on 1 October after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the international court on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia, which claims that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia’s access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who will face a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, not much would have changed.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after the closing arguments were heard means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but it may have cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Zárateeva said.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric drew all the goodwill that may have remained from the Chileans, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, has rejected the idea that the court has taken a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of the most popular Latin American presidents—used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t be trusted by the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises made at a meeting between the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong if it thinks that continuing sanctions and opposing the end of the Korean war will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious in confirming the prediction without Pyongyang taking decisive disarmament measures first.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up arms, which the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
At fashion magazines in Paris unveiled the latest line of huge covers coming to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look ahead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of weird oversized covers that blinded the style at Paris Fashion Week in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the fashion track.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion track.
The Valentine's piece that stood out the most was a beige hat with wide laces decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included watermelon with gemstones, a wizard’s hat and even pineapple – but your head won’t warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter’s masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to diving equipment with a breather and glasses, while the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow the fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant covers will come to stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow “La Bombi”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter lace was spotted on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The iconic brand for extremely impractical hats that flooded social media has sent another huge creation along the fashion runway – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model she wore.
A raffia bag in burnt orange, bordered with raffia crests and a white leather handle, was the centrepiece of La Riviera collection by designer Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for oversized accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results on exams, further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the place they have as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation is imprinted on his memory.
But if you speak to a man in his native language, words are imprinted in his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results from recent exams show that languages are at the top of the ranking with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who have studied a foreign language have achieved an excellent score.
Data collected in 74 schools members of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French pupils and 63% of French pupils also received an excellent rating.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Training found that 17% of the reasons employers are struggling to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language proficiency.
Therefore, language proficiency is becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future career path.
With future job opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in the global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, or 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With more languages, especially those from developing economies, children have better chances of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools are focusing on more classical modern languages, while others are teaching languages that are expected to be most important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, there is no denying that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut in the Lakers' jersey in San Diego on Sunday.
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will be over soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he’s going to play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers official reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need matches before the season,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, is launching a series of congresses in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned congresses next week, including stops in his favorite states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As his nominee for a seat in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s rally be in West Virginia and where will he be able to watch it online?
The Trump Assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to speak about the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual assault, which is expected to postpone confirmation in the Senate for a week to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of congresses is to help Republicans, who are waiting for a major election in November, gain a new impetus.
President Trump’s campaign, therefore, targeted these five congresses “to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional oversight is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the tough campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to West Virginia MetroNews radio, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, which would attract interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, in which he scored more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public opinion polls.
“It’s a bad sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come and ‘raise’ him in public opinion polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still has a desire to win and keeps hopes ahead of Sunday’s individual duels
After three one-sided games, perhaps Saturday afternoon duels of two pairs (foursome) were what Ryder Cup this year needed.
The swing swing is a completely fictional sports concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the swing go now?
“They had six advantages and now they have four, so it’s probably a new impetus for us,” Spieth said.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, as it leads by four points, and twelve more can get them.
But the Americans feel that they have the wind in their sails, according to Spieth, in addition to being encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the greens and gives a good example.
The shouts of luck continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when they tied Thomas with a two-point draw in the fourth game.
The punch that brought them victory in the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know he believes the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to the glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming two of Europe have won four points out of four and are indispensible.
The two "Molliwoods" were the only ones not hit by a bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy apparently flows between them and the noisy audience confirms the fact that they are the players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could seal up a possible European victory better than the Fleetwood or the National for the Molinaris.
Or both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to a bug and two double bugs in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a crisis from which they did not find a way out.
On Saturday, the players will not be able to help.
Games with four balls and duels between two pairs are exceptionally interesting to watch closely because of the communication between pairs, the advice they give themselves, the advice they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of the two pairs have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe takes the final day of the Ryder Cup with a nice lead after leading 10-6 against the United States after Saturday’s four-ball game and two-duo duel.
The excellent pair, made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did their best and with two wins over Tiger Woods and four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy they lost to Hazeltin two years ago, took the lead in the morning games with four balls over the American team that sinned, leading in a series of 3-1.
The U.S. team was better able to resist in duels of two pairs, where they won two games, but could not make up for the lag.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual duels if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari (the pair were dubbed "Molliwood") is the second couple to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they proved themselves again and even more convincingly defeated worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for moments, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball duels and two-duels, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning game with four balls, returned for the duels of two pairs and, in pairs with Henrik Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked first and third in the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
With 2 and 1, they defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in two-two duels, losing their first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's Cup history, the team returned after a four-point lag before individual duels, although Fury's team only needs an equalization to keep the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday's counterattack may seem too big a bite for her.
North Korea: 'Without confidence, we will not unilaterally disarm'
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing mistrust of the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho said at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body that North Korea had taken a number of "significant measures in the sign of goodwill" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, pushing the city for nuclear testing and promising not to smuggle weapons.
“We don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident of national security and under such conditions we will not unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject the nuclear disarmament as a unilateral disarmament.
Ri cited Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump's joint statement from the first summit between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader held on June 12 in Singapore, at which time Kim pledged to seek "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged security to North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not given in to calls to unleash the stringent international sanctions that apply to North Korea.
"The United States insists that we must first disarm ourselves nuclearally, and escalate the pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals by coercion, and even oppose the declaration of an end to the war," Ri said in a statement.
“Thinking that sanctions could put us on our knees is the unrealistic hope of people who don’t even know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued imposition of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president outlined at the United Nations Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If we were talking about the nuclear disarmament issue with South Korea and not the United States, the dead nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be such an oath.
Still, the tone of Rii’s speech was completely different from last year’s, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was unavoidable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump described Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations, but said he still has a lot of work to do and that the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timeframe for this, saying, “It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must be resolutely continued without exception until we recognize the complete, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent funding for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rome on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, and North Korea criticized him within hours, saying his demands were "gangster".
North Korea has pledged to demolish a missile test station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes "appropriate action" at a meeting with Mun this month.
Kim said the "appropriate measures" meant security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course that teaches them how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing machist culture of “all-year” learning, where strengths are accumulated with caffeine.
A university professor found that students of the world’s best universities often don’t know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, designed the course that is the first of its kind in the United States.
To conduct such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I only know this now that I’m in my final year?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sporting success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, says they opted for such a course when they found that students significantly lack sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of the door of the student's home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports success, and the importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We understand that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarette smoking affects their health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with the “overnight learning experience” and adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brain goes into a mode of hunger due to lack of sleep, which makes students not lanai.
19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler shape the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended a professor's lecture.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to take the course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that in the next phase, postgraduate students will be able to ask to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up an alarm clock for sleep as well as waking up. He also wants to alert them to the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance of the circadian rhythm, which makes it difficult to suffer
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit sank the river Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in guest appearances: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared the team of Steven Gerrard condemned to defeat by 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team chased their first guest win since February's dominance at St. Johnstone Stadium 4:1, but Gary Holt's team gave it a second defeat in 18 games since leading Gerrard, leaving his Scottish league lead team behind by 8 points.
Menga was attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen rangers did not seem to want to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to a frequent place, while Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals behind the Hibernian team
Calum Spence, a side referee, suffered a head injury when an object reportedly flew in from the fans' seats on the visiting team.
Gerrard made eight transfers in the crew, which easily defeated Ayr and qualified in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was sticking to the verified Livingston eleven-year-old, who had taken the point away from the Hearts team a week earlier, and he was undoubtedly thrilled at how his escaped team effectively neutralized all guest experiments.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after the start, when Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short run, who then went on to score Allan McGregor, but the scorer was inaccurate in the performance and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free kick then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score the ball.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a collision with Steven Lawles after 15 minutes of the game, the penalty shot should have been achieved, but Judge Steven Thomson squeezed the Colombian's demands into the mud.
The Rangers only managed to score two shots at the goal in the first half, but neither Lassan Coulibaly's header against the goal nor Ovie Ejari's fuzzy ball posed any danger to Liam Kelly's goalkeeper.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already fully deserved for his persistence.
The Rangers failed to cash in on another long-running Jacobs suit.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher picked up the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi for an easy attack finish.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly during the break with wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately turned out to be a pass to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his own style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more passes before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate after passing from the angle.
With the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shot at the end of the game after contacting Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
On September 30, 1882, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who later became a world-renowned physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
This became a constant in the scientific world, and it also gained its place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter. It is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactivity in materials has on atoms.”
Evans: “Madonna, now they’re really talking!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells and Destroy Them
The vaccine as part of therapy teaches the immune system to recognize the attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then altered in the laboratory.
After that, they can "see" the protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the trial vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient’s immune cells, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein HER2, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several different cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients who were “teached” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a protrusion point with the inscription MAGA on the cap after performing at SNL.
The audience was not enthusiastic.
Kanye West was whispered in the Saturday Night Live studio after a strange point during which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said he would run for president in 2020.
After ending his performance with a third song called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s racist?’
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
This time the SNL broadcast began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor sneered at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The recording of West's monologue was not released, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was going to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems behind the scenes due to the inscription on the baton.
“They came to me on stage.
So they said to me, ‘Don’t go up to the stage.’
I've been harassed!
But they say I’m lost,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lost scene?" and added that he had to hope "Superman's cloak, because it means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments made the audience whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were clearly embarrassed, and someone said of Vanity: "There was a deadly silence in the studio."
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West had a lot of surprises with the video for the song "I Love It" where he wore a Perrier bottle of mineral water costume.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “Some of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR REFUGEING TO PARADISE.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s fine.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be "a being formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE."
Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, was the first musician to change his name.
His acting colleague Snoop Dogg once called himself Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, then he was an Artist, once known as Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbed a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington sharply opposed to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wringing role as Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who strongly condemned the stereotype of the Machist hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can earn respect only with persistence.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture magazine that he felt something was going wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #IToo movement.
The actor, who recently married a 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has strong beliefs on the subject.
“Personally, I am seriously wondering at the moment where we made a mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men as we grew up about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the depiction of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do we learn on television and in the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose that particular part of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change this?
“Something went wrong with the young men.”
In an interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in the filming of any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, because he "finished with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will star in the new show True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose on the set.
“I met my wife because of this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love-selected character of the whale, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which represents a change from the past.
In some parts of China, HIV spread rapidly due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials from the conference in Junan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
But the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 people a year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a very serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
As conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman, according to research.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual intercourse in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines to treat HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff released information about Republican senators, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia websites.
A Los Angeles democrat has claimed that these allegations come from individuals and websites of the far right.
“Lies, lies, and more unacceptable lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown Capitol Hill official, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators concluded with Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that the IP address can be used to identify the source of the post, which is said to be linked to Senator Waters’ office, and to conclude that the information was posted by someone from the staff.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and a pure lie,” Waters said.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are under threat as a result of these false allegations, are in no way responsible for leaking this data.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and a pure lie.”
Senator Waters’ statement quickly came under criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of the branch of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it’s not from the right congressional test.
When you accuse someone of something they didn't do, they shouldn't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He must remain calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's democratic criticism of being accused of being too apparently angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, tweeted.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had notified "appropriate institutions and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English is back in action – Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for Brexit hints in any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 with the title Johnny English and the follow-up in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how ugly we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with bloated eyes and unusual grimaces gets permission to mix the straws again; already his name suggests that it is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It is an embarrassing secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a part of Clouseau, a snippet of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the one who contributed the last note to the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It’s also based on a traveler and an international mystery character, once played by Atkinson in the now-forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving real chaos behind.
In the most recent film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English approached in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor slammed against his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson’s gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems somewhat mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since “serious” films such as 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems like humor is meant for children and not so much for adult viewers, which is why for me the rejection of Johnny English's occasions is not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent sketches in the role of Mr. Bean.
The constant issue now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker infiltrated the online network of British top secret agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble to the competent agent, who in a surprisingly small role is represented by Kevin Eldon.
This is a turning point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a breakthrough due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has tried with the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that she could help herself with.
Intelligence informs her that all active spies have been revealed, so she must decide on one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who informally teaches how to act undercover: here the scriptwriters are hit, as English runs a sort of spy "rock academy".
The English are taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where they meet a long-time colleague, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports fan, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is almost lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble in the name of Her Majesty's Secret Service, while meeting the fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed in a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak onto the roof of the Volt yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volt's house.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energetic resembles a children's film.
Very average.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: is the British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies that they plan a four-day working week for the British, with pay for a five-day working week.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and get paid for five days.
A customer from business leaders wants the savings created by the artificial intelligence revolution to be poured into employees and give them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits the party’s economic plan and plans to put the state on the workers’ side.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve with the customer’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the customer’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign was supported by the Green Party.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this goal at the moment.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and the party does not think about it.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to tear power away from “cheeky CEOs” and “profiteers” in utilities.
The chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current stakeholders in plumbing companies may not regain their full stake, as the Labour Party could introduce “deductions” on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
It also approved plans for the inclusion of employees in the boards of directors and the introduction of proprietary inclusion funds, which would transfer 10 percent of the stake in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could convince him to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, a correspondent for the 60 Minutes show asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’”
He was determined, unwavering, unmistakable.”
Graham's voice seems carved in stone.
“I created my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very compelling reason to change him,” he said.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett has vehemently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom he had appointed could confirm this.”
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event attended by a truly extraordinary star line and with the same extraordinary mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held for the seventh time, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Great Trail of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event, i.e. the departure of the 20th century.
The Global Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Citizens’ Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees had to perform a number of tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to persuade them to call for action, or is this just another example of so-called “clickivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or twitting?
According to the Global Citizen Movement, since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” of its supporters have been recorded in the pursuit of a variety of goals.
It says these actions have helped global leaders to make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions would be 390 commitments and communications, on the basis of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and policy makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” which has promised Rwanda $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition in historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Partnership.
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 actions that called for the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But just like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid ahead of us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be present at this year’s event in New York.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian exports of energy – the U.S. Department of the Interior
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke reportedly said Washington could use the navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy trading, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The U.S. can do this, and the Navy will keep our shipping routes open and block them if necessary, preventing Russian energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of an event hosted by the Energy Consumers’ Association, a nonprofit group that is titled as the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic possibility is more or less to influence fuels and replace them,” he said, describing Russia as “a pony who knows one trick,” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is striving to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is said to expel Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to give up the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin “the hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons only and that this is unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the U.S. position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industry Union (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Interfering with our energy supply by a third country is a big problem for me," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “exactly consider” her candidacy for U.S. presidential election in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "exactly consider" her candidacy for U.S. president after the midterm elections.
At the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president."
Warren deposed President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is terribly troubling to me,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly openly criticized Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, before the election, we need an FBI investigation.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of her own voters believe Warren should not run for the presidency in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, with fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick has more support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
Other top Democrats who would be eligible for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden told the Associated Press that he would make his decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he returns connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are returning with,” he told audiences at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
She described Palin’s arrest as “the elephant in the salon” and said her son and other war veterans are returning somewhat altered, hardened, wondering where the respect for what soldier and airman and all other members of the military have given to the country is.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with assault on a woman, obstruction in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal denial of a new U.S. policy that denies the right to asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the aforementioned district filled the courtroom on Friday to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics has not been published.
She said her partner and "his violent sons, members of the gang," had abused her, but the U.S. authorities on July 20 rejected her application for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states that support Grace include El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum applications are coming to the United States, described as countries that are constantly dealing with gang problems and domestic violence.
In 2014, a new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision by the Immigrant Appeals Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "despises decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said.
Prosecutors said the policy that denies immigrants the right to enter the U.S. is damaging to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality, or membership in an individual social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma’s mother as she comforted her feverish boyfriend at an evacuation center in the shattered city of Palu.
“Rescuers are constantly bringing in the bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
It seemed that the townspeople were returning to the ruined homes, stroking through the soaked things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwij Haris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors for continued severe earthquake shocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get away.
I think it pushed me against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Harassment’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a four-page ad of the official Chinese newspaper was published in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday mentioned a paid addition to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials described Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new stage in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which they are exchanging blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to affect exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had affected U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now duplicates this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see very few other opinions on the newspapers in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic path, as communications are strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which.
Republicans lose polls ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh split, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most prominent Republicans supporting and advocating for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known for the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of elections.
Feelings are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University College in Syracuse, for an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the advancing MoveOn group, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is Coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate Hallway as Republicans overseeing the Justice Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the news portal Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all limits,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told reporters.
“People say they’re strong already, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially between the undefined polls in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that continued Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just a vote of the world or a final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also the way Republicans deal with Republicans and how Ford’s were treated,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, said in a statement.
Americans, on the other hand, seem somewhat divided as to whether they believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more support for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony most definitely, and 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh most.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or certainly a liar during the testimonial, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
The FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford was sworn in last week before the Senate Judiciary Council to testify that Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were together at a party, during their study at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to launch a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, opens a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners’ open source platform Solid.
Solid users can choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to “dominate the world.”
“We have decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows the user to create a "personal data storage" or POD
This may include contact information, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Similarly, as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
A special feature of the personal data storage repository is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
This is what the company calls “personal empowerment with data”.
CEO John Bruce says the idea of the company is to combine the resources, processes and relevant skills that will enable access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As early as this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “are not talking with Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could overnight abolish all their business models.”
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a statement on Medium, Berners-Lee said, “Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Carrier of the Victorian Cross of the First World War
In their hometown, they have been celebrating for 100 years the award of the Victorian Cross to the only priest of the Church of England, who gained it as a fighter in the First World War.
Reverend Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann earned his recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he had been awarded this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two Colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deed, with which he earned his honor.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quintin Canal "through a very dense fog and under the fierce fire of the battlefield and machine guns."
Later, he flew towards the line of fire and with "the greatest heroism" led the line forward, then attacked the machine gun himself and hit three members of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 2018, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and that “the bravery of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be expressed by many people.”
Fans of mixed martial arts watched the Bellator 206 all night long, but the Pigs of Pepa took part instead.
Imagine: You’ve been up all night watching a completely sold-out Bellator 206, then you can’t see the main event.
The San Jose event featured 13 duels, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, viewers in the UK were astonished to find that the show had been replaced by playing the Pig Pep cartoon.
Many were not very enthusiastic, as he remained awake until the morning just because of the duel.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "some kind of a sick joke."
“According to government regulations, this content is not suitable at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa's pussy. Yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they are trying to adjust the schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix it,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switching and not all were friendly.
We tried to settle the matter; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the real reason was a government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we’ll endure five duels – as usual. We’ve tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we’ve made up our minds.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “insignificant” about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation – but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that “not everyone” was aware when he entered high school.
Speaking on Desert Island Discs' first show, hosted by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that as he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, has been absent for several months due to her illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valued" than everyone else because "it was socially unacceptable to love boys and girls."
“To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference are the real thing that gives me the strength and persistence to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, in order not to disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
A twice-bronze Olympic contender has become an influential LGBT rights advocate and has appeared twice at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” by his romance with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley got married to an Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you’re so young” – he attended the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a child in June, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "whole look".
“If you asked me last year, all I would have to say is ‘I have to get a gold medal’,” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had a ticket to London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘This time you won’t be in the first place, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead did I finally have to admit he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving at the Olympics in front of my home audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – Proud musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympics and which still makes his skin smooth.
The Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson transferred to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape again so it doesn't become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will take part in the biennial event for the record 12 times, left Captain Furyk at Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as it was so often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what weighed him down.
Given that even at the peak of his career he did not measure the most straightforwardly, the 48-year-old is not the best fit for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes the missed hits.
And if the pitch alone wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact winner of the British Open, Francesco Molinarius, in the ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the run-up to winning all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four games fewer individuals at the start of the 12 games, would start well, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he had today, he folded my back and held me by the hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the most famous and has made a great contribution to the teams in the past and also this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some inconceivable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make people crazy and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they got along with him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s much more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup games can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had five points advantage over the Americans, and the goal was broken by a hair-only advantage, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Remember, we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but hardly,” said Bjorn (pictured) after visiting the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and 6 yesterday and led the National Golf with 10 runs.
“History shows me and everyone on the team that the Cup is not over.
Play in full tomorrow.
Go and do what you have to do.
The game isn't over until it's written on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and that's what we need to stay focused on.
He has always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Excited about his players’ playing on the challenging field, Bjorn added: “I would never rush over here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be a game of individuals, so this will have to be tackled differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things are going well, and when you’re alone, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is a message you have to pass on to the players: tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the reversals in the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, told his players on the last day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this drive gains tenacity, it puts a strong pressure on the midfielders.
We created the right layout and put the boys in a way until we felt like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned a task to try to lead the battle and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“For this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
New German warship postponed again
The latest German navy frigate should be put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War, but due to system failures and rapidly rising costs will not be up until at least next year, local media reported.
The surrender of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, says Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The vessel is due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by worrying post-delivery issues.
Four Baden-Württemberg class ships, ordered in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigate class.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
The constant delays mean that the top-notch warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to influence even overseas, will become obsolete by the time the application starts, according to Die Ziet.
The unlucky frigate F125 appeared on the front page last year when the German navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and German media have cited a number of key "software and technical deficiencies" that would render the warship useless if it were assigned to a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown to be overweight, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's capabilities for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – became a problem.
This is expected to reach a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) – from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was in fact "lacking ships suitable for deployment."
The official said the issue had become more acute over time because the old ships had been dismantled and replacement ships had not been provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study is being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands, in which they are trying to discover how bats use food when hunting food.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown eared bats and peripheral bats on the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At the key sites of the estate, special tape recorders will be placed to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what types of what they are doing.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk is also represented by wind turbines and lighting, as well as flywheels and some types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Butterflies are not actually blind.
Because of the night hunting habits, prey are more helpful with their ears than with their eyes.
To accurately identify errors and obstacles along the way, they use a sophisticated ecolocation technique.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, shelter inspections and occasional rescues.
The organization even established the first and so far only Scottish reserve, specifically dedicated to bats, on the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a great area for bats on Threave,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and a whole quality habitat.
However, much is still known about bats, so the work we do here and on other farms will help us better understand what they need to succeed.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on farms, as the possible accidental destruction of a single birthing site of bats could result in the death of up to 400 females and young, which could lead to the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Flea Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we simply don’t know how well their populations are sticking.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 to remain silent about the event.
In a speech to 142 million followers on Instagram Live video hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as "fake news"
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they were saying was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added smilingly.
Ronald’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges they have dubbed “an unacceptable report of suspicion of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “intangible damages in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after a meeting at the Mayor's nightclub with Ronald, she was reportedly returned to the actor's room, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good man” who only “disappoints at one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual intercourse, but described it as consenting.
Mayorga also claims that she was referred to police and that photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "terribly afraid of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims she wants to cancel the settlement as she continues to suffer severe trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before his transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus after a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘would forever regret’ loss of car manufacturers
The UK "would forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that Britain's withdrawal from the EU without a deal would have temporarily halted production at a plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “timely” principle, with parts of UK and EU suppliers for cars on-demand arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK exits the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause border disruption, which industry representatives say could lead to congestion and a shortage of parts.
Toyota could not store parts for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would stop.
Clark said May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told Today BBC Radio 4.
“The data not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue the highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to comment on how long production would be stopped, but warned in the long term that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, a lost job is never returned."
The government spokesman said: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" due to the ongoing fight over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-election meddling, the links between Trump’s associates and Russia, and the potential obstruction of the judiciary by the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Attorney General’s envoy and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of an eavesdropping device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he intends to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said Rosenstein "would rather not be fired" and the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict by hearing a Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set for him; it could have happened this week, but given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, it could have been postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always want to make sure you’re informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the host of the show, asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of meetings is not to be attributed to the resistance to the "posting" of TV reporters, but she said: "I couldn't deny that they were posting."
She then mentioned that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding, without citing a source, "we've looked at the numbers."
But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, it is infinitely better than discussing with me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared free-spiritedly and partly bizarrely in front of gathered journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and the desire to continue the work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, SME, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued, as the decision-making process approached this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities we care for.
In Scotland, you can feel completely at home. We really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie has undergone surgery for head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers line-up supporter Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennessean newspaper's Mike Organ reported.
The Tennessee State University head coach told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the edge of the playground and kind of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the edge of the playground before putting him on a stretcher and taking him out of the playground for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "details about the type/size of the injury are not yet known" and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently in college, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since graduating from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered five strokes together before leaving the game, raising his total number of strokes in the season to 18 strokes.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Tories.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
An increased fee will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move should be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to ensure more affordable housing and higher taxation for high-income people.
A higher fee will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will encourage the government’s efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The surcharge – which will be charged in addition to the current rate, including the elevated levels introduced two years ago for other homes and broadcasting properties – could be no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year with the imposition of the measure.
Non-residents in the UK are estimated to have bought 13 percent of London’s newly built property, resulting in higher prices and a more difficult purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the hips to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The major construction companies have accused the price increases by grabbing the land they do not actually use, and Mrs Mayevo has called for the waiver of quotas for affordable apartments in order to fix the British "housing shame."
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to error-free forced evictions.
In addition, it wants to give city councils greater authority to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my leadership to renewing the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our dysfunctional housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and for foreign companies, buying a home is as easy as for Garage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of a home is too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become a manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-placed club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland as a child in Hampden, so it was always something that pulled me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross's predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic team boss, who had previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he did not feel fear as the successor of such great names.
“For me, success is measured by the question, ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’”
In terms of structure and capacity, this club definitely belongs to the First League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could take the club there again.”
Ross has only served as a manager for three years after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a member of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
Alloi then helped prevent a third-league downfall, and St Mirren led from the edge of the downfall to the championship title next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This was probably a real breakthrough,” he recalled the takeover of Alloe.
“I was really convinced that management is the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous, because I was doing well as an actor, so I had a relatively good time with it and I also achieved certain major successes.
But the game can become challenging.
We have to face a lot of things every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to run the club and I’m doing it now. I feel most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of hard-to-break British pubs, but the pressure on restaurant chains has also increased.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor, who prepared the data, said: “The persistent sunny weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month, when the revenues of pubs increased by only 2.8 percent.
The drop in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June continued to increase in July.
In comparison, the turnover in pubs and bars with drinks increased more than the turnover in restaurants decreased.
The sunny weather has also reduced sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, but not as dramatically as in restaurant managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% in one month, and food sales decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman of the RSM Group of Leisure and Hospitality Analysts said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When selling in the hospitality market, the biggest factor remains the weather and the influence of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a fall of 4.8 percent at year-over-year level will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For food store owners, a long hot summer could not come at a worse time, and only time will tell if the necessary recovery will bring the temperate temperatures we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slower introduction of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a benchmark in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established industry reference.

A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of pupils said they run a censored “main” account that they show to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed her daughter calling on visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete on and off the field and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community. We are confident that athletics in Scotland would have gained a great deal by joining the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a 200-meter and 400-meter race from a total of four Olympic medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has been left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was strenuous, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows has shared online reviews
The company that produces breast pumps has shared opinions with an advertisement comparing mothers with cows at milking.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom the device offers.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a stable filled with hay, on a song that includes the following text: "Yes, I'm pumping, but no tail is seen," and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my nipples, these are my tits."
The choir continues: “Squeeze, squeeze, feed the babies, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook website, has caused considerable discontent on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was a joke at the expense of the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and scotchy to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them in the first few days after they are weaned.”

Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both the mother and the puppy.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement completely unfeeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she thought the song "for the sake of christening" was funny.
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it too if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I understood it the way it was meant.
It’s a brilliant product,” wrote another.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that targets moms who run out of milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.”
It’s not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with hidden pumps in their bra.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and mothers’ ECD, added: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the parallel movement between women pumping milk and cows dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in a fun way that women can connect with, show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump came to the front page.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the modeling trail walked for the designer Marta Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Relocated to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand the children over to sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they are afraid that applying for a child would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would be required to provide fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or household members of the sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are punishable foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will show up with a videoconferencing call and not in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to statements from shelter workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Advocates have said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where the signs of a child’s distress are more likely to remain unnoticed due to their size.
They added that relocating children to a tent town without emotionally preparing them for it or giving them a chance to speak from friends can complicate the trauma that many of them are dealing with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would "act accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the congregation.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to flee their homes, was “almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" that convinced the refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are turning into a political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive rehabilitation funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why will Trump get a second term?
Following this decision, Mr Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are no signs of spectators getting tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership at the time of the peak has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC’s viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak time, more than Nielsen’s 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the acclaimed comedian and author of “Just Funny Works: And Some Hard Truths About Spying at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different interpretation.
Remember driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, a Washington story could decide on the future of the Roe v. Wade case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was swollen inside while watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
In no way could he escape, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and hung in the air the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money is being used in preparation for the tightest interim parliamentary elections
It is no surprise that in 17th Pennsylvania a flood of money is being observed, as two candidates were in a race for the same seat due to the reorganization of the congressional districts.
This recently-divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn when a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th district touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March special elections for the 18th County of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in the county.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
In the United States, they thought about sanctions against El Salvador because of China’s support, then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump organization.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from “recent decisions to cease Taiwan’s recognition,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received US$140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including anti-narcotics aid, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a restriction on financial assistance and a targeted restriction on visa issuance, would severely affect this high-unemployment and murderous Central American country.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials said they wanted the conference to continue, ending deliberations on penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference attendees, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now in the public records already very much evidence.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are many questions about this, and I do not want to say that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, nor of his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such milestones, the course of history is changing and the inexorable march of democracy is being accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are dealing with several such breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in turmoil since that official reported that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated about his inadequacy for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed as the Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will demand Mr. Trump's accountability?
If we fail in these trials, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later ordered me to light Sabbath candles on a swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that the win over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position for the Group G European League qualification.
The knee injury prevented forward Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season ahead of a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for larger achievements.
“That was a point we deserved because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We have come into the game in the belief that we can achieve something and score a point.
We might end up winning, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better side in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am confident with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
“The last year has undoubtedly been difficult, given everything that has happened, including the injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Poor sleep for women because of fear of savings
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talked to their family members about it.
Half of Nationwide’s survey respondents said they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t make an effort to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start as follows.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t talk to them about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in your cost estimate.
Involve a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the crossing.
Choose a health care professional by identifying a trustworthy person who will oversee your health care and ensure that professionals will take into account your health care wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider empowering a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in your action plan so you are ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to increase.
When communications were interrupted, rescuers from the Donggal regency, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are aquaculture and agriculture, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also an important activity, but it is mainly carried out in Morovalija, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo have been hit by a tsunami over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit northern Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake-active Pacific fire ring, which is why earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake hit the Pidia Jaya regency in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not trigger, but the collapse of buildings resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, took the phone out of her hands.
Palin was arrested at the Mat-Su Prekassin facility and is under unsecured $500 bail, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, saying he was "certainly innocent" when asked about the defense, the network reported.
Palin was charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
Palin's crime isn't the first time he's been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
My mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of alcoholic weapons in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died in the quake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami struck the coast, hundreds of people were detained at a beach festival in the town of Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Claim Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
Prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifull Saip, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan when he hit several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of a request for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be any of the charges.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury acquainted Saipov with a 22-point indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “substantial planning and deliberation,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s approach as “condemned, cruel, and perverted.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruji, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damiano.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District Court ruled on the death penalty ten years ago.
Prosecutor Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in New York City in a federal case in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, has shown no regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS, which he watched on his phone.
Police also said he had demanded that the ISIS flag be unveiled in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "apparently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that a decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Brexit talks should be blamed on Nigel Farage, says Tory MEP
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of her own MEPs suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “out now” if he were Mr Farage’s Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mr. May in coordinating his deeply divided species has been highlighted by Tory supporters of Brexit resignation who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister tries to keep her plan in line between the attacks of Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that May would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave congress in Solihull to “get rid of Chequers.”
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and assign him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
This Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU as follows: “In the world wars, we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue.”
The meeting was also attended by Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active on the streets and even lead us to elections.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.’”
In a message addressed to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians should be given a “feel of heat” if they intend to issue a decision made in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to sell Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to the crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit, to feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army, which has secured us a victory at Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the remainders walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A handful of activists waved the flags of the Tories against Brexit this weekend after the group was formed.
The Labour nobility Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues in the use of the party's application after the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the border without congestion, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren to “examine closely” possible bid for president’s office
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “investigate closely” participation in the presidential race after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump’s co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
She is at the center of speculation that she could cope with Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for the post of president.
Warren responded that it was time to “bring women to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top.”
Arrest after death of LSU Sims player in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect on Friday for shooting LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Station reports the arrest of a 20-year-old Simpson message at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene of the incident, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 198-centimeter youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vett
On Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified against Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that “the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race.”
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on the dry as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into the box later and left him behind Vettl, but after some driving action, Hamilton noticed that Ferrari driver disliked leaving the inside open and risking being left behind in the third corner after two defensive moves.
Max Verstappen started with the last line of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then, most of the race was without a tire change, as he intended to perform a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and occupying fourth place.
He finally entered the boxing in the 44th round, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me by.
The team did a really great job of getting to first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence not to disclose letters from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch on Ford’s testimony before the Senate Inquiry Commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, corrupt, and liars.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last few days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the posts and the revelations, and people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer ... you disclosed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, wait a minute.
We revealed it ... No, we did not,” he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose her letter,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not fit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
It may not be true, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats are abusing the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
You have seen evil, hatred, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to beat to break into power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars were redeemed for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday match in Dundee 5:3.
The Giants led early for two goals in the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home side, and then Dwyer again achieved a lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for the Dundee before Lundvald Nielsen's two goals assured them a win.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated the Dundee 2-1 from behind on Friday night.
This was the fourth match of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later, scored David Rutherford.
In an intensive introductory part, Sullivan led the home side again at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave Cown a draw at 15:16.
Dwyer managed to lead the Giants on a break when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard made up the back with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead at the end of the second third and secured a fifth-goal victory for their half-time team and a fifth-goal victory for their team at the end of the last third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller killed hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after sacrificing his life so that the plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died in Friday's tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, many of them missing.
The area continues to be shaken by severe earthquake shocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a heavily hovering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it so that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart breaks when we hear that,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, as the country's disaster mitigation agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sigismund and Boutonga was limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase, as there were many bodies under the rubble, but many could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves of up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it was originally reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to the call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the waterfront as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that eight passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said that the plane missed the gun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to penetrate the water slamming into the belt to the emergency exits on a diving plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, but he suffered a minor head injury himself.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers who repaired the wharf nearby also jumped to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data shows that in the last two decades, 111 people have died in air crashes in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
Analyst Determined the Time of Night When a Woman Was Burned Live
The prosecution on Saturday presented its evidence in a re-trial to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone tapes to determine the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger official reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he said he was “lies because he was [my] truck in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
The recordings on the cell phone show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact information from his phone in the time after Chambers' death.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present the closing arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial would be judged by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York babysitter sues a couple for dismissing her for a "racist" message
A New York babysitter sues the couple for being dismissed in a discriminatory manner after receiving a mother’s wrongly sent message complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies racist treatment and compares the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when, on the arrival of the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, found out that she was a black woman.
“NEEEEEEEE NOW ONE BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After noting her slip, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unpleasant", fired Maurice, saying her leaving babysitter, who was an African-American, was doing poorly, so she wants to hire a Filipina, the New York Times reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then they sent her home with Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation of $350 a day from the couple in court for a six-month period for the work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like that aren’t done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice’s pardon was reasonable, fearing that they would no longer be able to trust her after regret.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racist,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on. "
Comparing the lawsuit to “immigration,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Will you treat someone like that?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still underway, the court of public opinion of the couple on social networks has quickly condemned his behavior and way of thinking.
Publishers of the story of the Paddington bear feared that readers would not connect with the talking bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to find out now that Paddington has become a great hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting the inspiration to write a children's book about a little bear toy, would have been outraged at the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year was the 60th anniversary of the book "bitter-sweet".
Referring to Paddington, who she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“There was a man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington’s bear was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You’re proud of him, even if you don’t really do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington the Bear himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
At the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Then she called regularly to say that she felt really bad, that she didn’t expect that to happen,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be at your place soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications she was given by doctors to keep pumping her heart were slowly being taken and left her system.
She had been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the test she is undergoing.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head tilted and there were tears all the time on my cheeks.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Woman Sticks Posters to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to dissuade others in order to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste posters on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room.”
However, before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a truly dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Ms. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they’re friends.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who had been Davies's friend for several years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was completely on the ground, and when the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma for them, but they had to rework it: “She made a hole in the whole family.
She broke us.
But we have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the air at the start of FBI investigation
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – by the duration and extent of the limited investigation – it might unify us,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would “disintegrate” because of the consolidated party stalemate.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is the result of the time that the investigation would take place.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, which will take place on November 6 – if Republicans, as expected, do not do well, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to elect a wanted man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a breakthrough from the heel of the position and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has declined under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1,127 people fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the price hike demanded by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not yet publicly commented on this.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula effort.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a stalemate since then.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi described Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate Brett "hysterical" and said he was "characterically unfit to serve in the Supreme Court."
Pelosi said in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that a woman, if she behaved like that, would be labeled ‘hysterical,’” Kavanaugh told the Senate inquiry committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were still teenagers.
In the recital, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking at the discussion of his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission and called the charges against him “grotesque and coordinated bullying” organized by the liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed as the Supreme Judge because he was biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he discredited Clinton and the way he dealt with the Democrats with such statements,” she said.
Pelosi is asked if she will try to file a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and the Democrats will get a majority in the House of Representatives, for a moment.
“If Congress or the FBI doesn’t tell the truth, it’s inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court it’s in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh’s possible decision against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And the woman's got to be shaken.
It is a fair outpouring, after months and years of overflowing anger, and cannot express it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: “I was very much helped by a woman who was a director somewhere, who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique, namely, when she became angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe I feel sorry for her.
I am angry.’
Then she just went on.
I thought it was top notch.”
Tears are partly allowed as a way out of anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office dominated by men, and I once found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, was the event when an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a cold leader who always stepped on me, who was always a little afraid of me.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t know you’re angry.
They will think you are sad, and they will rejoice that you have been beaten.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping across a fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to quit the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply saddened to find that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“This was not a well-thought-out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and one was the last thing that was needed at the time.
“Someone called the game ‘The Snowman and the Seven Sticks.’”
Since she was the last to join the campaign, she lagged behind in raising funds, so she decided not to enter the game unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in the conversation that she was not going to launch the official campaign, her emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so hard to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – so overwhelmed she began to choke.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media reactions.
“They would think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salve of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle hasn’t been over for a long time, experts say a rift between nations could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively meaning taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time with equivalent retaliation, most recently with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to move eye-to-eye with the United States and probably won’t blink anytime soon.
In order for Washington to give in, China would have to agree to his demands, but the U.S. public removal would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing knows how to make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a security expert who focuses on the newly established Asia-Pacific Center.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All the conditions have now been met for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems throughout most of the championship, slammed the ball into the water at the 16th hole in the pair-3 game on his initial kick, which forced him to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 at any time since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth defeated the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, by 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in Ryder's Cup the last time.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, with 25.5 points has become the most successful European player in the championship of all time.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
This year has been difficult.
I am very grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the trophy again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European win.
The relay is handed over to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 at the individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods, and as I grew up, I watched his games,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time to win 14 major titles, right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked tirelessly all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the championship.
“After a bad performance for his team, the American captain said, ‘I’m so proud of these guys, they fought.’
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
We've failed.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to have to get together again, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're going to move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Put your hat down.
“They nailed us.”
Red tide news: Concentrations along the coasts of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratosa districts are decreasing
A recent report by the Florida Commission for the Protection of Fish and Wildlife (FWC) shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC Commission reported more scattered blooms in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends about 130 miles from the northern coast of Pinellas County to the southern counties of Lee.
The cliffs are seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
Over the past week, there have been reports of intermediate concentrations in the County of Pinellas and its shoreline, low to high concentrations on the Hillsborough County shoreline, base to high concentrations in the Manatee County, base to high concentrations in the Saratosa County and its shorelines on the central and central axis.
Breath irritation continues to be reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation from Northwest Florida in the past week.
