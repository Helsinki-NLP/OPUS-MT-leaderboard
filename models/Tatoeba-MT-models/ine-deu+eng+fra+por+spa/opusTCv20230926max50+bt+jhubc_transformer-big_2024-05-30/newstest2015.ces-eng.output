Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transfer at the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can skip the transfer window and make a big transition.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently a substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smíchov NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and is going with the Czech national team to the general games with the Americans and then also to the sharp start of the qualifying for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In the new season of the Premier League, Chelsea receives the advantage of Thibaut Courtois, Czech for the first time in ten years in the position of substitute in the London club.
There was speculation that he might be interested in Real Madrid.
At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup to Athletic and was unable to enter the league when he lost 2–4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He scored two wins and two draws for the French league season, scoring St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressed shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league and broke up with Lille 1:1 over the weekend.
News reports have surfaced on English websites today that they may want a Bohemian in the Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet put a 4:1 course on him.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your jersey in the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but in football, there's never a hundred percent.
Maybe during the day there will be an offer that will not be rejected.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know how an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
There would have to be an agreement of all sides. First of all, it would depend on the position of Chelsea, whether or not the club would resolve a possible offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transition now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new premises?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, they are all at some place in the national teams and I am sure there will be a lot of transfers today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs are there on the planet that can afford you?
I don't really know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation where I did not catch the new season in the first three games is new to me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
“I want to continue to compete for Chelsea’s goalkeeper position and it’s up to the coach who chooses what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family, of course, belong.
Is it possible that you would catch up with another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo
The new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abem. On his first major visit since May's election victory, he is to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to establish economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
The list includes, first and foremost, plans for broader cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to reporters, India also hopes that the two nations will agree on cooperation on defense issues.
Police in Karratha arrest 20-year-old man after motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it flew at 125 km/h in a zone with a maximum allowed speed of 70 km/h and ran into the bush to escape the police.
In the morning in Karratha, the traffic police tried to stop the blue motorcycle at the edge of the road when they noticed that it was driving 125 km/h on the exit of the petrol station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then drove into the bush, so the police lost him out of sight.
The motorcycle and the person who matched the driver’s description were then spotted in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have accused a 20-year-old man of disobeying a call for stopping and negligent driving.
The trial in Karratha will take place on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster charged with rape in Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man will be tried for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was acquainted with the charge during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on June 7, 2013, at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
Webster allegedly attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent."
Webster is also prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have drafted a law that aims to protect trade unions as a civil right.
“The way unions work, jobs work for the middle class,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator for Minnesota who is a co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That’s why I’m so proud to be able, along with John Lewis’s occasional rights model, to introduce a law that empowers employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal opportunities to prevent discrimination in trade unions as it does for other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Adjusting the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination to join trade unions, to sue in a civil court - and to condemn compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other lawmakers are putting forward is to reaffirm the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states – Americans have once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand, and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of assembly in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They believed that employees and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, incorporated language into them, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to create associations that ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that restrict this right or seek to damage it will be revoked. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the petitioners and Roosevelt's guarantees included that "everyone has the right to stand up and stand up in the framework."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions — and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners — must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but have enlarged it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and elevated production to unprecedented levels.
Those who attack the trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn’t forget, and we shouldn’t either.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers said would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
A decree signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to come into effect on September 1, would require abortion practitioners to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital up to 30 miles from their practice.
The judge’s ruling means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and must, in the meantime, obtain this authorization.
“The proposed party will be able to legally conduct its activities and will in the meantime be granted permission,” Federal Judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution regarding the law.
Activists for abortion rights welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from the pernicious law that is meant to deprive them of their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sued three out of five clinics for blocking the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also concerned doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs and were also applying for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion, together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this permission imposes on the doctor requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion opposed the measures aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would have led to the closure of clinics.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, there is only one licensed abortion practitioner in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while awaiting a request for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research lead Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medications can slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gynaecologists, who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old Elisha Neave, a young mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to a study by HTA published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could result in the garden centers losing up to ten million pounds a year when today’s young generation of consumers reaches “the main age group of gardeners.”
According to the report, people who rent homes spend on their gardens an average of 55% of the amount that people who live in their own gardens spend.
As other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to earn <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking spaces and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% over six years, one household has the lowest spending on gardening products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society stated that housing in sub-rent or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor for RHS, said: “Renners are very fond of growing plants in flower pots — when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the gardening retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher yields for this year due to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of Hitlerjugend, saved with nuclear weapons and basically showed everyone that their views are stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
I feel, however, that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they are able to be controlled by both a disenfranchised nationalism and that the complex of minorities can be transformed into imperialist lusts.
Time seems to be moving differently in the east than it is in the west.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for domination over Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the seizure of Nazi power, and followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today’s situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians are probably missing a time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half was shaking before them.
Perhaps it was the Western politicians who blamed themselves, perhaps little to Vladimir, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they began to underestimate him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made orders at home, pretended he didn't even want to go anywhere, and was grinding knives at home.
Now he has decided to regain his lost position.
He starts slowly, he has time.
He's probably a leader for life, so where would he hurry?
He stepped on the Caucasians, now he's stepping on the Ukrainians, then it's the dwarfs of the Baltics.
Those Russian bears have been pinching their furs long enough.
This will surely be noticed by China, which somehow jumps too high and certainly makes a hiding place for the Far East.
And those Germans are joking about Vladimir, too, how good they are, and that's what I put on their ass at 45.
How about we make a new Novorossiy in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there are a lot of ours there, and as they squeeze them there, they already wanted to tear down the dachshund from them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Now vote for their Prime Minister Mr. Sobotka, he is so soft, he can be peeled like onions and I eat the whole of their EU.
That's what it would be like to jump to great Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we will use our compatriots who live in their territory as detonators.
There are plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they're just being oppressed, and we're not going to leave it, we're going to protect them.
And the Russians will rule again, for what else is he born for?
After all, Europe is good only as a template, on which the proud Ivan can dance Cossack.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called on the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish government officials negotiated the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and internet magazine The Intercept reported that, according to documents provided by former analysts of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said all major states were following each other.
An earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, sparked a more outrageous reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series introduces more tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of how the fourth row tricks were created.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when the giant army of the famous Daenerys becomes a clumsy soldier.
Police Director in Magaluf Charged with Corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of blackmail by police officers and city council officials in the Calvia region to the Mallorquin State Prosecutor’s Office.
The Calvia police director on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on charges brought by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the autonomous region of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for being linked to the corruption charge and will be heard by a judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC cited dissatisfied nightclub owners as saying that the benefits provided by public officials have serious implications for their business.
“It’s not about making money, it’s about survival,” one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf has made it to the top of magazines around the world after an 18-year-old British tourist posted a video on YouTube that provided oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunkards and rioters in the ranks of holiday parties in Magafula by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours around the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the Carnage bar tour, paid a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is popular mainly with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashion wave known as “balconing”, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that impacted the flight at the airport in Adelaide
SPRING brought an ice-cold surprise to southern Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds severely hitting Adelaide airports.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall overnight on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few short gusts associated with the storm and wind gusts that started at eight o'clock in the evening and over a period of about ten minutes brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early spring doses came after winter last week, the city’s temperatures fell again to just 15.8°C on Monday.
It is believed that stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land sometime after 19:30, but a change in speed or wind direction hit it at a short distance and the landing was forced to be delayed.
Wind gusts at the Adelaide airport at the time reached speeds of around 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to land from the second landing and eventually arrived at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused further delays in flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
The temperatures in Adelaide are expected to reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday, with one or two highs likely to occur.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. Schools in Gaza, however, remain behind.
The beginning of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel marked by attacks, but the signs of fighting are still apparent.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, employees of the school that was hit by a rocket have removed the remains of the shards from the wall and are slowly waiting for the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a Kibbutz Saad and English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was "a little strange" to go back to school.
"We've had a few hard times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, near the border with Gaza, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which a fire from a Palestinian mortar killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about 12 families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in secondary schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace deal on Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas’ demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars during the fighting against Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have hid in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Due to the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and due to ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope they open the school soon so that we can complete our education just like Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
Vrba at the meeting: I stand behind Vácha.
A Lafatu disturbs the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague today before Wednesday's preliminary match with the United States and the subsequent qualifying match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Twenty-three members of the squad have problems with the Spartan striker David Lafata, who is suffering from a fever.
David isn’t here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players and David still has a bit of a problem.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's going to be two or three days, or if it's going to be fit tomorrow, it's going to be based on his health, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not that they could not train or participate in a match on Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan midfielder Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Luká<0xC5><0xA1> is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I am behind it," said Vrba to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latatu.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
On the weekend, for example, Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural from Liberec, who gave the hattrick, shined with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata is doing.
If he cannot be available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I cannot nominate any of the players who were interested in the Czech league," Vrba said.
There will be a training session at Strahov this afternoon, followed by a classic pre-match training session on Tuesday before a duel with the USA at Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The game against the Americans will be played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will strive for a premiership victory under Vrba.
In the previous three qualifying games, he lost two draws and lost one.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is then on the agenda on 9 September from 20:45.
Walking in the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is happy to have more time for training, unlike previous encounters.
It’s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that maybe we didn’t have that much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands as best as possible," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves on Thursday in Italy before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary national coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us information about the match.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a match and we're going to have a film and we're going to have to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told the bronze medalists of the recent World Championship.
According to highly watched statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter season have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are the market leaders.
RP Data shows that prices of apartments in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising on average between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by the state-ordered spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “true test” for the market.
“Given the continued high rate of auction sales, the generally high rate of sales and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even more over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never embraced me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry tries the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, Henry underwent “meticulous” therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve just heard his voice: “Stop the ramus.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton—when I was a kid, they were grown up—were going to the bar with him and discussing things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a kick in cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner who reads newspapers.
Henry recently visited the Dudley foundry, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
Today there is a little more light there, but it is still a dark, smokey, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there is a lot of smoke and suction.
Dad always went into the bathtub and just lay there, then it was heard he slowly began to sing for himself, because he washed himself from the foundry.
As I walked around, I realized he'd been doing this for years to feed his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Yet Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
It was only when my mother was sick and dying that we began to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
They are still good friends with French, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show up, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center and I also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And exhausting.
No one wants to eat carrots themselves.
The change in the direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, briefly trimmed beard.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
It was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's Plot.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him on stage, parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black imitator/comic on television."
He studied at the march.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I had to learn how to make up jokes, be a star, and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors disguised themselves as black, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer alone because of it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What has been “an award-winning product of British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque black parody.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him away from commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and roles in movies, but after broadcasting his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Lene, it looks like you're stuck in one place or another."
Next in line was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...? / What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines from Othello's closing speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
“That’s it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsal was tough and I read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which did not happen.
Soon he began to play a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical failure and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for seizing the audience.
"A voice in my head said, 'Before the computer works, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.'"
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked out of the stage and something inside me said, “Oh, thank God.”
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle it for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry v Plotech v Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like a sign from God that says, “You should do this.”
Of course he says it with a loud voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has a comedian's brain - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances as he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you are still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it like I used to.
I asked if he'd ever go on a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps outline the beginning, the middle and the end of the road – I don’t think I’d ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to light up on non-existent employees
Kenya began biometric registration of all its government officials to try to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer receive pay.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they leave the public service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to prevent corruption in the government.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state is losing at least one million dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month on the salaries of non-existent employees and with further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be credited to bank accounts even after the employee dies or leaves the government, BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from Nairobi said.
All government officials must come to the identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, according to the government statement.
He also says that anyone who fails to show up without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
“By designating real public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its economy and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for 'conspiring' against government
Local media reported that a total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiring against the government".
The police have not commented on the case so far.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and phone wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the action of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine.
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On the occasion, he told reporters present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools have traditional ceremonies held on September 1.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Jacenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will acquire the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the Conservative Party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the Pearsons media world.
For seven years, she was the executive director of the Financial Times and resigned when her younger colleague took over the senior position at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her retirement approached a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, a former CEO of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's job as a cup of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also out to the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
But which CEO would risk coming into a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, breaking it up and thus getting himself out of work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn’t so hard, a lot of people would love to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and revise its status.
With the widening of the competition circle and the new technology questioning the old certainties, the immediate negotiation of concession fees for the BBC carries great danger.
For a modest amount of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in something that is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC is telling a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, with each costing only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, compared with 31% ten years ago.
Models of use of BBC services have changed: Today, newspaper headlines appear on my mobile phone and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry Says He Didn't Approved An Offensive Tweet
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, which was posted on Sunday, contained an offensive image of the Democratic Attorney General who initiated Perry’s criminal charges of abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which distancing itself from the previous one.
A tweet left my account that wasn't authorized.
“I don’t agree with the tweet and I downloaded it,” he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the news with questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet was published by a nonsensical, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney General Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
He tweeted: “I don’t always drive with three times the blood alcohol limit... but if I do, I’m suing Governor Perry for calling me to account.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg’s office.
It was headed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the indictment a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the case-monitoring judge to dismiss the charge because the use of laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has suspended payments of $7.5 million from a state fund for the Public Interest Department, which is headquartered in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civilian activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes even famous.
After finishing in fifth place on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might have already finished, tweeting his own photo of him running near the lake, and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to "normal"
One of London’s most prominent development companies warned that the housing market in southeast England had “returned” to normal activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for demanding Berkeley clients, said on Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from the peak in 2013.”
The London housing market was doing well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent last year alone, far ahead of the 6.7 percent average in England and Wales.
The average selling price of Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student housing rose by about a fifth last year to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, in recent months, London property has not been as attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "seat tax" that politicians came up with ahead of next May's parliamentary elections.
LONDON (Reuters) - London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that an April review of the mortgage market, which introduced tighter lending rules, would also slow down the market’s growth rate in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has lowered its 2015 London real estate price forecast to 3% on the basis that home prices have already begun to fall.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive districts such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington fell by a quarter each year.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and this has kept forward sales going.”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
Annual earnings before tax increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenues by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday ahead of Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said Berkeley’s annual revenues are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley stocks stopped at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Hacker Posts Naked Photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is attending the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence’s photos have been leaked on the internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other start-up actresses.
“Hunger Games” film star spokesman confirmed Lawrence’s photos were true and criticized the hacker for “apparent privacy violations.”
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker's photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, were allegedly obtained due to a gap in the Apple iCloud Internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of the hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Elizabeth Windashiate, and Mary-Mary, Kim Odashiate.
It's unclear how many photos are authentic, but the movie star of "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our homes are satisfied with themselves," Winsted wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known for Nickolodeon's cable TV series "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were real, saying on Twitter, "These are my alleged naked photos, people."
It's better to cut it even in the crack. *intentional word play*.
Buzzfeed on Sunday night announced that pop star Ariana Grande’s spokesman denied the alleged photos were true.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposing like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
It was only from time to time that a woman told him that he was too serious, complex, sharp, isolated, and perhaps a bit sober.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it in a hurry.
He could pee like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was a starting love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild hairy ridge and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and hospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited a property in a damp but beautiful valley called, conveniently, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, the bathtubs were dead spiders, the snails slithered on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was vegetated, and the weeds resembled huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cottage of children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat behind the folding chairs in the long grass and held hands of the old man, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning the public station, which supplied the region with comforting music and calming messages, when he looked at the old man's face.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren’t banned – there was nothing really banned – they just didn’t play.
They helped them get into the decade, just like the word decade itself.
The taste of the people has done what the regulations and the status of the law could never have done, and just as people choose memoirs about books, in which a poor person becomes a rich man, a cook and a romance novel, so in music ballads are chosen.
The cavern let itself fall down and began to play the imaginary piano, singing the serenade to Ailina's big feet with a rough, comic voice.
I don't understand the island.
"It was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to squeeze the letter j out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at the word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny then, and it wasn’t funny now.
He just knew what was expected of him, that was all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard one.
Not even jazz, even though it wasn't built directly outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only one “if” in life.
When the song started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability went on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in songs.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior for ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she couldn’t remember the time when the favorite singers weren’t black.
No laws or pressure, either.
A leisurely society is one in which every part of it with gratitude – with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared – agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution used to play and athletics, singing and running.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like a natural gift for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks who remained were dishwashers.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while what happened happened, if it happened - they were afraid that they would be blamed for putting them in the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire would not consume them for the next time.
Everyone according to their talents.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the dirty words that Cavern had just sung to her could make music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he hesitated to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he finally said.
She shook her head unbelievably and overshadowed Kevern's view.
All over the world, nothing could be seen but the confusion of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said dubiously.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk at all.
Maybe some ankles...
You say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm kind of perverted.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to tame the cruelty that lay in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was a deliberately cruel Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose from her bed, threw down the radio, and poured out the unsweetened wine.
No wine, so drinking couldn't do it.
She seemed to shake in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm obsessed with being an idiot," she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she confronted him.
Did you think he'd hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was basically the same there as here.
The same wide and icy ocean shone over them.
The same obsessed men, after what had happened, even more insolent and ugly than their forefathers, the smugglers and the Kaziworlds, bloomed furiously from pub to pub, ready to reach out to any woman who dared to refuse them or to get away from them.
Idiot?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to anoint her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote of faint ballads of love that the radio swallowed - first to anoint her, then to anoint her with one murder.
In Kevern's view, too much cultivation, because petting was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She felt angry herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave, as if watching him from an upstairs window, the man who had been hit by what he had caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart tightened because of him and all the men in general, even though a few of them had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hung, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic twenty-two-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statutory monitoring system of Public Atmosphere, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and medium-severe acts of violence, where he was involved in the most violent acts in the country.
"A lot has been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the overcrowded, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of the church towers, only the wings of the people rose up from the fences above the living ones."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It may seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the intuition.
The inhabitants sigh at the sentimental ballads, swallow the unhappy stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality holds as stiff as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence does not point to the strengths, they also point to the strengths.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too floral," said her supervisor.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I feel like I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has reaffirmed her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"Therefore I do not ask," Rabinowitz said at last, "that I should have anything against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
There's no prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unbiased companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are preconceived towards the Church - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Keeping up with what happened, if it happened, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is preparing the country with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head was a pink blink on the light board, a recommendation that Ofnow had been sending out to the world for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, a sung word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she was sure that her superior was gone, "and I am not saying that the wound did not heal as we assume it had healed.
Above all, my fear is that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, if it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the ends of his fingers.
That was meant to mean endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe the steps your grandparents may and may not have taken as mistakes.
You’re going too far in talking about venting your “anger” and “misconfidence” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there was no “them.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we are honest with each other," Esme took courage, "we are no one without guilt.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we all agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to seduce anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past to do other than to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz untied his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the pavement in a way that passersby described as “brutal and furious.”
Accidents happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho claims no coup is planned - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in the Lesotho kingdom have denied organizing a coup in order to overthrow the government, claiming to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family traveled to the neighbouring South African Republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but the army’s response to the threat of “political fanatics” that the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the defence forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the ranks of the police who plan to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make a trigger in the country,” he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has declared that he has seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesotho defense components seem to bear the stamp of a coup d’etat,” he said.
The military officials of the Lesotho Kingdom said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was calm in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believes he is the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to internal disputes, tensions have reigned in Lesotho.
He said that despite the contrary allegations, his actions do not undermine the government.
Production in the euro area is at a thirteen-month low
According to a closely monitored survey in August, production growth in the euro area slowed to a thirteen-month low.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been dropped and the factories have been damaged by growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will require a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone’s delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering a quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States joined during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the damping effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty have on producers is becoming more visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an eleven-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring,” Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to pour oil into the fire for analysts expecting further monetary or tax stimulus to be implemented.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August purchasing managers’ production overview is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone currently have a very difficult life, because increasing geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty in trade has been demonstrably affecting – and above all, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially the ones that are costly.
He said it was “more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Hell Beslan Survivors: Ten Years of Horror from Occupied School Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals held a thousand people hostage at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during the three-day suffering that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the horrific occupation of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people including 186 children, survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy united the East and the West, leading to action and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted misfortune, even though the memory of the hell-induced terrorists in them will live on.
What is their biggest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine – and in which children like them are dying – is already over.
Girl trying to get back into the ruined school gymnasium
It was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as she tries to get back into the bombed-out school gym in her underwear only after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now in her 40s.
There were fears that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were made of blood.
I got up and went back in to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
I've got shards of shards left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people just as doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t destroy it,” she said.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Jero Gapoev was killed there.
When we were kids, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about captivity, but her memories fade a little every year.
I am happy that so many people around the world are still remembering what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from the UK and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the internet, climbing through the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at the age of seven) and survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, “Flee.”
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the child by the hand and ran away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother is dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara stumbled to freedom and lay in the hospital with an injured leg and, on the contrary, thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the disappeared News of the World), where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember throwing all my guns at the game right after that.
But today I can play computer games where he shoots, and I don't have a problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember a trip to London very well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffers from the war just as he and his friends have suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I am so sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror,” says Damir, who participated in a volunteer activity at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police, and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “Thirty-seven children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the silence immediately after the attack, and there were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
He remembers his journey to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And it's only been a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think there have been and still will be many children killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news they hear when they get bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a nice and quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about it at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates and from time to time they go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he had trouble with it - I remember lying on the couch with his face turned away from us, sometimes for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember him throwing away all his guns or other weapons to play with. Damir is 17 today, he's taller than me, pretty, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on unlike any other.
Grigori Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Consolation: Survivor of Beslan Grigori Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigori today
When he was running for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, there was fear in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocities in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dismissed him on his first day at school and hurried to take his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I took off two minutes before the terrorists broke into the courtyard, so my little boy was there alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a single day will pass without us remembering the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to be a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Constantly returning memories: The picture of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right)
I remember how Grigori looked forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like to look at the picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that this image makes people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the crash of a Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what the cause was?
This world awaits something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little, it takes dozens of years.
It affected my health, I still feel it.
I had a nightmare attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was frightened every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who killed me.
That’s why, as September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardio surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle that he survived.
“It feels like it was yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've thrown behind my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can cope better - I have to say that's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, a year later, it was the first and last time I ever entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that familiar picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me to go to school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I injured, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn’t enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg because of my health, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical records, and they replied that it was not possible.
My other favorite is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished the second year there.
He is learning how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said, “I know I’ll never tell my kids about it.
It's not something kids should know about, and it's not something they should experience at all.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
It's inside and it's getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will be attending commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so thankful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but he carries on this horror.
It's hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He underwent several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say it's over 50%, but it can't be completely over and forgotten.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that pain only worsens.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose the dead.
I know families in which other children have been born, but also widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm observing what's happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could take all these rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who took a special commando to safety
Rescued: Alyon Tskaev is taken to a safe Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (on the right) and does not remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, Alyona was taken into custody by a Russian police officer from Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in custody in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan is remarried and they have a little girl named Kristina after their dead daughter, Svetlana.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and she has grown up to be a smart and happy girl.
A close friend said, “It’s a big happy family and Alyon and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.
A man accused of beating a girl on the transition to a sign in the village of Fife

4 Tips to Take Better Photos and Videos Underwater
If you are interested in photographing or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is the compact Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with a couple of cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but there are a few rules to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are designed for up to 5 feet, others for up to 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them do not work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with photo composition, but outdoor cameras don’t have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly visible underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of shots with slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper submergence of light, it decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in photos - the deeper you sink, the fewer colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is an excellent advice if you are photographing on land, but underwater is even more important because of the more muted light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the sick from the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was a MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the overwhelming majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
But one day in 2007 he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of influenza and found himself impatient and his wife Juliet included remorse.
He remarked, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him an X-ray of his chest.
He had skied in the French Alps once or twice a week.
X-ray results have arrived.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the sinus or lung lining.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fibrous material that was previously referred to as "miracle", but today it is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous form of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on industrial use of asbestos came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is peaking in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice as many as car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
A disaster in the form of a mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we study, and in the shops where we shop.
Mesothelioma therefore does not respect the social stratum, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from London's commercial houses to public schools do not represent a hideout.
The house is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even insulate.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement hallways of Guy's Hospital where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question that he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy’s Hospital and who then developed mesothelioma in the past five years,” he noted in a 2010 letter, “I am the only one still alive.”
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
Illness is always deadly.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to Professor Julian Pete, a leading British expert on the mesothelioma, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
When looking at the files from the court archives, which are often addressed by the handicapped and require compensation, it shows how much the mesothelial calamity has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised in two stores on the clothing section - one of the places was the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are over 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never even dreamed that it could be about me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name is due to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is most often found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake lining.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
But more dangerous is brown asbestos (wet) and blue asbestos (crocodile).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Marsk & Spencer's Asbestos Exposed at Oxford Street's Flagship Store in London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete’s work points to the fact that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma with no known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
Much of this exposure is due to the "normal use and ventilation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined Westminster Palace, shows that even the people in the middle of the government may not have a clue that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that said service elevators and pipes behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fiber could be broken by something as harmless as a “strong stream of air.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliament Services has insisted that the Westminster Palace II receive a “positive medical certificate”, it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be required to thoroughly examine the Parliament, modernize the electricity and remove asbestos from the premises of the West Palace II.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One of the people who have never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when something like a cold hit him.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly, I shuddered.
It came at once.
I was awful.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the thorax, the lining around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, she had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
Eventually he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors had an X-ray of his chest and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent for examination.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed in.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lung lining.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to take nothing too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year's Eve: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters from Macmillan's charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now starting to develop the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous tubes thermally insulated with asbestos were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients’ lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Students build Bunsen’s kahan on asbestos mats
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos mat.
Websites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools have been created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofing shelters on tools in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970s, when a garden house was demolished.
So be careful how you demolish the garden cottage.
With the knowledge that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
“It’s going to take a while,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor’s position to a patient’s position.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt with the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all of this," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was told it was twelve months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to have another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive – breathing itself – is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the sinus, the lung lining.
Asbestos fibers irritate the thorax and can induce cell mutations.
“The problem is the needle-shaped inhaled asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who entered Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Lawson’s Treasure knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “lonely breathing pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
Its nature is invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer do not take up so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the thorax," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “doesn’t respond to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect,” but doesn’t cure.
“Sometimes there will be someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they'll all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould has died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and counselor for people with similar disabilities.
When they called, he introduced himself cheerfully, “Hello, you’ve called the Cancer Headquarters.”
“It was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “could show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim from the Department of Breast Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they would have to approve the reimbursement.
In order to get to the best treatment available, the issue of money is key for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments inevitably fail, many patients face another financial mayor - the future of the family they leave behind.
So they go to the courts and ask for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Exposing deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or collapsed.
The fuse record's gone.
And those who defend themselves now have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been approved this year, making it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to find their former employer.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, which is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally allocate to them as compensation - approximately <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 applications are expected to be successfully processed.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “good job.”
“It’s an agreement signed by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay had it not been for time and people with mesothelioma would have been able to track down former employers and prosecute them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former minister of labour and social affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that the seven deaths each year required swift action.
“People are suffering too much and need help right away,” Penning said in December last year during a second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasury, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott strengthened it.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six chemotherapy cycles.
Check-ups showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went for another checkup in March [2014].
I had a few spots [cancer] scattered in my chest.
My fiftieth birthday was approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
I'll take it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how the alarm on the boiler works.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It is difficult to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) unpleasant certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma does not endanger life.”
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloth.
Asbestos fibers are used to solidify cooking pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
A fabric that is non-combustible was invented.
I saw napkins made out of it that glowed in the fireplaces at the feasts
In Italy, asbestos is beginning to appear in commercial use, it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa, soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
During the Industrial Revolution, it is an excellent insulator in steam engines and turbines.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
The statistics of Prudential show a higher mortality rate for people working with asbestos and then life insurance is denied to them.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were undoubtedly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaw’s employers, Turner Bros. Asbestos, decline responsibility.
They won't pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships were built intensively, and work in shipyards posed the highest risk of asbestos exposure.
Ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms its first successful action for health damages as a result of asbestos exposure in the UK.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The UK Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
The use of all kinds of asbestos is prohibited in Britain.
In the United Kingdom, the Mesothelioma Act comes into force.
A $350 million compensation program has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material in many parts of the world.
World production is held at two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership, protesters vow revenge
The Chinese parliament has decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
It is likely that this move will trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The People’s Congress of China essentially allows Communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it angered us,” said Democratic Party Speaker Emily Lau.
That's not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong were lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China’s decision, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Li Fei said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s leadership elections would cause “chaos.”
Since 1997, when Britain returned the Hong Kong administration to China, Beijing has promised that residents will be able to vote for the executive branch from 2017 onwards.
China’s leaders have presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are holding the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most watched protests in years.
The majority of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are backed by the Central Occupation Movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupation in Rain gathered in front of the headquarters of the Hong Kong government.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that a wave of protests will begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central only as the last step if all options for dialogue were exhausted and there would be no other choice.
We must announce with regret that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is unavoidable.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, strengthening the protection of the government's headquarters and deploying police and barricades on Sunday.
According to many residents of Hong Kong, the incitement to riots is a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the area of products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being flexed by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation movement and say their demonstrations threaten the trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” said politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could damage investments.
Chinese state-run media have also come up with reports in recent days that Democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
Pre-election agitation?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
Approximately 1,600 amateur athletes play a small kick in the county town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
And their highest competition is renamed Together for the Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that was going to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the top ten of his candidate is the head of a small kicker in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general assembly where there was no problem with it," Mraka said.
The situation around the first league of small kicks was already dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava Town Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, a small kick earned around a million crowns, according to the city's website.
This year, it is in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not a small kick in contravention of the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for grants and subsidies," said the spokesman for the magistrate, Radek Tulis.
Taking subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing a small kick in the support in the elections of one political party, that is probably not possible anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to a high-level "big" football.
That perhaps the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD regional transfer, the ODS division or the KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 would be created.
What about class and competitions?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from companies to contact us," said Miroslav Vrzá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the regional football association.
The head of the small football of the other side and the movement will not let in the name of the league
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách field is not ours, we are renting there," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> from Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
However, in my opinion, there will be a nonsensical area for skaters, about fifty of whom are in Jihlava, for example," Mráka said.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small kicker uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ického and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports grounds at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoons.
I think there has been tremendous progress in the last few years for a small kick," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the league titles will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one sector joins us in partnership, we no longer put the other one there," he explained.
"A political movement in the name of the league, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the municipal sports commission.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mráka is using the Malá kopaná Jihlava association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - beginners can fly jet plane
We are pleased to be able to respond to demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or cars like the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its own security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that as the services have just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who enter university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the college because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic necessities.
Feminists Protest Racism and Police Behavior in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Attendees waiting for the funeral with their hands up, chanting: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in the online debates of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With rising tension in the Midwest, which has attracted the attention of the national press, Perez has noticed that the reaction of whites is 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of blacks shortly after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines like “White thinking over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
“I don’t think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level,” she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be expressed.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially determined that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Koritha Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light the problems African-American women face every day that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that colored people are trapped in their own country, it is quietly deafening.
“How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
According to her, black women could not afford luxury to clearly share these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although whites today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases of white rape," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of whites.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when campaigners such as Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people can have the right to vote - women or blacks.
“They decided to bet on the voting rights for women and the right for blacks to focus later,” Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why black women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to start organizing against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the first black women asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the resentment of white feminists’ reactions to the questions that Ferguson has raised – the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists have had to “reach for” the issues that blacks have faced for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these [traditional feminism] spaces took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” she said.
The second wave of feminists who have made their careers a struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took over two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead by an attack on Facebook, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of The Guardian demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society – and opinions about race that differ significantly in public opinion polls – will strive for change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America embarrass some people.
Expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks are facing criticism that she has already evoked.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that comes to the fore in the interest of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied juveniles in the southwest of the country this year, the question of reforming immigration laws has resurfaced – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that in order to be able to address the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them are in a position to be vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a resonance in women’s organizations,” she said.
Pig housing in Ipswich for sale
A real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it published it, it rested on it in a pig's living room.
A one-bedroom detached house, for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the sofa of a pig.
The Connells real estate agency said the pig in the photo is the pet of the owners.
"The photo was there by mistake, and therefore it has already been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In the property information, the Connells real estate agency described the former prayer house as a “single detached one-room house.”
Although the office has already removed a photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
The lottery player in Harvey will win a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, one lucky man will take home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery.
Traffic in Harvey had its share of luck for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 it was a $1 million win.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said the whole city in southwest Perth is talking about winning.
This is the main theme and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia shared one win last month, ending several lucky weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple won an incredible $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains will not leave tonight.
Drivers want higher wages.
In a press release, the GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose time outside the traffic peak.
At the chosen strike time, the GDL takes into account the many people returning by rail from the weekend until the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of people coming to work during the day," the union said in a press release Monday morning.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight, less passengers," the GDL added.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike announcement.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
Trade unions are calling for a five percent increase in drivers’ wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of engine drivers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million kronor) per year, depending on the years worked out.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept wage increases when working hours are shortened.
In doing so, they stress that the wage rating of drivers must evolve in the same way as that of other railway personnel, for which DB does not count on the reduction of the working week.
Crest's car was about to start burning.
That's why the Barum rally ended.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t even think it would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been repaired provisionally and continued at a slower pace to the service station, where the mechanics would have replaced it?
If we were going straight there, yes.
But we had two more earrings waiting for us, and we couldn't.
There is a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five speed tests at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were quick, but I didn't cross the line.
It was all caused by the fact that we had been piling the car for more than six months to get it to some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it so that you could really think of winning.
I had my car and myself ready so we really had to win.
The work didn't go in vain.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technician said no.
You weren’t the only one who retired early from the championship.
He also lost his foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Surprised that so many favorites left?
Oh, yes.
It was a pity for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you are preparing a car, also moved on the top for a long time.
But he paid extra for flying off the track and getting a nearly two-minute gap.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a pity, because he could repeat the ranks of the winners.
After all, he was driving the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well prepared.
He was driving very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular participant in rally races?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year I said that Barumka is my last race and I still didn’t keep it.
I decided to drive it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go.
But I'm not thinking of anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, it was because of them that we started.
A lot of people, familiar or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumce?
The team goes on.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the fabia of Honza S<0xC3><0xBD>kor from us for this race.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you tell me something?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican rally was part of the World Championships, the fifth place there you reached your peak in the series.
Aren't you tempted to try the tracks there again?
He's not attracted.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a certificate of incapacity from your doctor, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the dates would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was only made orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer’s consent to take leave confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has proven to be successful.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, can be rejected and absence at work can be considered as a long-term unforeseen absence, therefore a reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute about the agreement with the employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, only you have those days listed in the statement of credit as an unexcused absence.
An unwarranted absence from the credit card does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. inability to take out material unemployment insurance), however, it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have a written confirmation that the injury actually occurred, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "failure", it is only a doctor's certificate).
When you are looking for a new job, you can submit the above-mentioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and the early notification of the employer or the request for written consent to take leave.
This avoids any possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a little behind half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race track.
Stewart fell into a draw for the second time after his right front tyre burst in the 172nd round, and the race was over for him.
Stewart took the damaged car into the garage, didn't speak to the reporters, and left.
Chad Johnston, the team’s boss, said the No. 14 team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I'd like us to have better performance and better conclusion," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do better there.
Stewart stumbled onto a penalty kick for the first time in a Sunday night race after colliding with Kyle Busch, requiring repairs to the right side of his car.
"Today's race we put hope in a good ending," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation into a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was killed, which put Stewart on the road during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked up to 10th and then even to 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, drove out of the second corner, and hit Stewart, sending both cars into rehab.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague chooses new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the tenders for the new administrator of taxi stations.
For 103 parking spaces, it receives approximately 12.3 million crowns a year.
Until recently, she collected 150,000 crowns a year for the same seats for taxi drivers.
This was reported by Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city used draws to select administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a lump sum of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, it decides the amount of the offer.
"A year after the cancellation of the original lease contracts and the start of the tendering procedures, it has been shown that the new lease system is far more advantageous and generally more fair for Prague," says the councillor.
The most expensive spot is on the perch
The highest price was offered by those interested in a place in the street Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B>.
They pay <0xC2><0xA3>2.1 million a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for the seats in front of the House of Commons or in Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the council in the autumn of 2012 and the original rental contracts were terminated in the summer of last year.
Tenders were held in four waves and a new administrator found 29 posts.
This was the second time we had to clean the well this year.
We dropped it every time, creating virtually a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Sava there.
Incredible smell!
Our well in the cellar has always yielded enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, Grandpa worked it out with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three turns and totally unique, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the year.
When we started the season, of course, we were running out of water.
When she was there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, the water didn’t smell.
We wondered if something had fallen.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible with a little luck, there the board was not quite enough, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
There was nothing else to see in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we let her out again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package of bones on the ground.
At least that's what it looked like.
And one more piece.
Now it looked like a rattling mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where there are vents, grandfather's invention, there were fish residues!
And it's hard to beat!
Our cellar is also unique.
Some would say that Grandpa just dug up the hut.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just choked sand, only the ceiling is subdued.
There are mainly ships.
And the car.
And sun loungers for the beach.
The door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone walked in one piece.
At the ceiling a few of the above-mentioned vents.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the beams.
There is no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fight, and that's it.
The air didn’t help either.
The whole basement smelled.
We also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out the things that were around: the boards, the heraclite board, and so on.
Our cottage in the distance welcomed the passing disinfectant dish.
We were wondering, who could have pulled all the disgusting debris out there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She wouldn't be able to go to our house for dinner.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who wasn't quite right.
Isn't he the one who put all the disgust in there?
He's been here almost the whole year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to guard the cellar and well and check it regularly.
After a few days everything was fine.
We started using water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests are finished, but it was already good.
Drawing water from a forest well is not something I would like to do for a long time.
One day, we heard a terrible anxious sigh from our maid.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The cut jumped over her and whistled like a madman.
Mom invented it because she thought Réza had dug a waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partly rolled into the club and partly straightened.
There was a sigh on the balcony.
The incision had a hysterical seizure.
We ran downstairs.
The fence, over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented her from doing so.
It was unclear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the fence saw the exaggeration in the form of our whole family, it probably said that we should eat it when we are so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the air into the cellar.
We flew after her.
Like a lightning bolt at the well.
By the way, we noticed another fragrant package on her plate.
It smells like a fish.
She wasn't there yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little shady.
And we locked the cellar during the day.
That I'd...
We went out, and there we all lay to one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's embarrassing for the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on its neck.
Then a whole block of water leaked into the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to get inside.
Expelled employee takes revenge, buys laptops from the company and sells them
After being fired, the fired employee bought computers from the company and then sold them.
The money was spent before the police were detained.
In a short period of time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notebooks after the takeover to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, the chief commissioner of the Smugglers' police.
The motive for the fraud was the revenge of the employer for the dismissal and also the profit of the money.
"When he interrogated us, he claimed that he used the money to repay the loans," Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in slot machines or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
A fraudster, who has once been convicted of theft, is now in danger of being imprisoned for one to five years.
The police have not yet announced whether bazaars that bought the laptops below the price and continued to sell them will be punished.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
None of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a number of changes.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the destination to the bathing pool, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the booth where we took photos and videos together.
To bring my view to perfection from the other side, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
Together with my friend Katya, we were obediently ranked at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who walked around us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
The shouts of joy, but instead of a quick start, followed by the cupping to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and run at a rate of ten.
We fly with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad almost a kitschy note.
The pulsing meat stretching over the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it traditionally begins to show who has how much strength.
A light hill on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí forces many runners to slow down or go for a walk.
Just before the transfer to the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately after him Vítek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta flies at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I hear the admirable sighing of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to slap me, but just before that, my leg is pierced and our hands are tight.
The theatre street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I can't breathe and my feet carry me almost by themselves.
After the first snack comes the moment of truth.
During the crossing of the road, Katya climbs over the ridge and shows the jump sailing.
I see if she needs help, and I run a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue through the Goat alley, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, at this stage of the race there is no longer such a flood, but it is still necessary to observe the area carefully.
I have no idea that the term narrowest place will get its true meaning later on.
Behind the Dust Gate we are freneticly encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to applaud anyone who offers a hand, and I also advise Kata, because ten applause with fans is like half an energy stick.
It's really working, we're accelerating again, and although we've fallen pretty badly, now the hunting has started.
We run over dozens of runners, when I pass by someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one is ahead of us for the last snack, we are accelerating.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you really need to get soaked.
The sun has slowly set, and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race.
Last exit to the bridge, turn and just a straight line to the finish line.
The pace at which we're running makes me wonder where that girl's taking it?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen, let's move!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and here's the goal.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a 20-hour limit.
So seven minutes on schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katie's legs are broken, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly pull her out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think of the printer in the walkways to the dressing rooms.
Here you can see that Goat's alley wasn't the narrowest place.
That’s right here for the purpose of a swim, which is under the pressure of nearly ten thousand runners crowded to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, this isn't the place for them.
I also lose my mind after a while and wonder if the beautiful views and compared to previous years, the more interesting route was worth what is happening in the finish line.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to it, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route has shown runners many interesting places, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere inflated in the Yellow Baths was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators graded it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, in the course of the city's historic center, obstacles cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bounded on the one hand by a wall and on the other by a river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I rate it as very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what do you think about the situation in the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of prison service workers across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand to reintroduce the original working conditions, which have changed in recent times.
The list of demands to be discussed with Acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The overseers symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“The meetings are still going on,” said BNR Director General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees in the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the Universe May Have More Dimensions And We Can't See Them
Physicists usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University hit the black hole in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the density of problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today - an attempt to unite two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between the two key theories (because at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solved it in such an imaginary way that it is worth telling even the laity.
In addition, Greene managed the complex material so freshly and compellingly that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he has largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will only be a little more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Greene's nonviolently open door to the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions can certainly sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let’s turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more grounded, namely a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine a 100-meter garden hose pulling from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the entire scenery from a half-mile distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you will easily notice a long hose stretched in the horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer from brightness, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Due to its large distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at that moment, you will answer it with only one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometer, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In this enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clockwise hands", i.e. around the circular diameter of the hose.
You are beginning to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you need to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a hose wrapping on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (known experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
The non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the hose wrapping circumference is short, "white" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important characteristic of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, curved, and much less observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not exactly anticipate to reveal the "sacred" dimension of the hose wrapping thickness.
I just needed a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like hair or capillary - the folded dimension would be revealed only with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent an article to Einstein in which he exclaimed with the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
Kaluza argued that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be vetted into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately the question arises as to how this observation of Kaluz goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and twisted dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the length of the hose, our universe has large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at every moment.
But analogous to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can also have additional dimensions, firmly twisted into space so small that they have so far remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that on the perimeter of the hose we draw a relatively dense number of circles in black color.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, we will now reveal the curved dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif in Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, that is, four spatial dimensions together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let’s look at the illustration in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in the same way as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level, represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid depicts the commonly known "large" dimension, while the circle depicts the new, tiny, and twisted dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of usual dimensions - just for the sake of clarity, we drew them only into intersections in a square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of the space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, shown by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see at a few of the first levels of magnification.
However, as we move beyond the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth magnification level in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circular-shaped, curved dimension, similar to loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have only outlined the circular dimension in some, regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The resemblance to a hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
The most important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - is much harder than observing the obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed beyond the power of our most modern magnification tools.
Most importantly, however, the additional dimension is not just a round bump within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of top-down, left-right, and front-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the usual three still position in the circular dimension; if we also count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional folded dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can easily have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely see the smaller coiled dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could have the size of approximately one Planck's length, that is, size far beyond the distinctiveness of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola Tips on How to Exercise on an Electric Guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-act harmonic form, which you can repeat arbitrarily.
If you are interested in music theory, you will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be watched here, he has been living as a graphic artist since his graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which he is said to be unable to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, like his brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start your training with a single string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, then just apply it to the harmonious model of twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to and watch Honza, what can be imagined with a twelve-string harmony and how nice it starts to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, pay attention to changing the tune, Honza warns in the video.
Next time, Honza returns to the pentatonic and you try to put her together with the twelve.
Exercise it honestly.
Best of all, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola during the first lesson of his school of electric guitar playing here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák
We take the point and we are happy for him.
We had a better chance in the first half, we had a better chance in the second half," said the striker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
You weren't nervous playing him, but he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
Somehow I didn’t notice it, even though on the second goal, where there are home fans, it probably would have been worse.
You made the penalty equal after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's going on? What's going on?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, a corner came out of it, and then a penalty.
After that you got up and the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal scored until the break.
In the cockpit, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn’t.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
But it is also true that the homeowners said something about their game, they were probably not very satisfied with it.
You have only scored for the first time on the opponent's field, while at home you may not have scored a goal yet.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn't say there's such a difference, it's up to us how we deal with it.
In Brno we started well, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that is another category.
You waited for four games to score, weren’t you afraid that it might be similar after the last game?
It’s probably not, but of course we’re glad we haven’t had to talk about waiting for a goal since last game.
Now we have added another one without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from miles away from the crater.
A lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from miles away from the crater.
It is located beneath the glacier, as well as part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
For now, the situation remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the fissure approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, and with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulfur, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption of Fimmvör<0xC3><0xB0>uháls in 2010.
This is much larger and there are also much more gases," says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Traces of a sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.

The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through the wings
Aerial day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, aerial acrobat Peggy Valentino was introduced, who during the flight climbed from the cockpit to the deck on the upper wing of the two-decker and also between the wings.
There is only reference to muscle strength.
This year’s flight day in Cheb has already been held for the fifth time and the organizers have once again managed to prepare some interesting pieces of flight.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on the wings" by German acrobat Peggy Valentino, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
In the aftermath of World War I, many ex-war pilots were enlisted.
However, due to the large number of fatal injuries, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit on the top wing after the launch.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>jí<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main point of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang was the famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with the Grippen of the Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so-called in numbers).
Such a setup could be seen by flying fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone breathtaking acrobatics with a 1945 plane.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was placed in military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiste.
In the same place is also another pearl of the Cheb Aircraft Day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, there was a huge machine to be seen.
His polished aluminum coating shone in the distance.
The machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French aviation was also admired.
A small transport aircraft jumped behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought a part of the German delegation from the German Hof for an aerial day.
The German neighbors demonstrated in Cheb with reconstructed Yak 18T aircraft or a three-member biplane formation Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhy swapped her parents' care for work at least tonight.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator obviously doesn't know anything about it.
After all, she was doing well in moderating TV news, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months at all!
It is only two weeks since the blonde ended the sixth week, in which women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
Lucie, however, will not appear regularly in TV Nova's main news session.
A regular return awaits her, according to Blesk.cz in a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in the black.
Exhibitions for the year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans to say goodbye to Jagr
It would be worth it if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union builds up to this," he said after an exhibition called Golden Match, in which the amazing Nagan team met again.
Even the players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players would love it, wouldn't they?
Sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can find one or two days during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
Let’s tell Gum (Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>légro) or Bed<0xC4><0x9B> <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey play-offs?
So when I fly in like that...
You don’t want to play in the team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting change your decision in any way?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are decisive in representation.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed at all.
How did you enjoy the Nagan meeting?
The meeting with the players was great.
The man revived his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
However, the most important was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimír R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echmánek on the switchboard.
Will you still remember your first national game?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: me, Robert Holick and Robert Reichel, we entered in a trio.
It was everyone’s first start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, we can't say that.
In Jihlava after a long time caught Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashana on the ice will never surprise me.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized Jagra for the reasons he decided to end up in the team).
The squirrel did a great job too.
You were training with me one night and there was a hole.
And now he's catching the fabulous.
First in the United States and then in the Netherlands, footballers start qualifying.
Prominent guests descended to the Smíchov NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrbu...
And there, that character in the black hat, that's Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
The Arsenal defender and captain of the team arrived at the meeting about half-twelfth among the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, as he had already appeared before the journalists in the national team.
Czech national football team
Monday, September 1st: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the meeting
Rosické et al. can support the fans even before Wednesday's match against the USA (20:15).
The team has opened a training session for them on Tuesday, which starts at 6:30 p.m.
And it will be followed by an autograph, which Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> and Bohemia will not miss.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be more peaceful.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We’ll have time to practice things that haven’t been done in so long,” said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three games under the Vrbá, all of which are preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she tied 2-2 and lost 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been significant.
It's just now.
The match against the Netherlands will be the start of the qualifying for the 2016 European Championships.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also manage the general against the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about it to be successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player in the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is attacker David Lafata.
He's having a fever.
If he hadn’t recovered before Wednesday’s game against the U.S., Vrba coach would have called another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die many years after being misdiagnosed.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence believing that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in the area of motor skills such as muscle weakness, awkward walking and twisted toes.
Insensitivity or pain may also occur in the affected person, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA), a disease that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
A mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell down every day and it took me longer.
I was never able to ride skates or skateboards with other children, and at school I was harassed for walking and running.
When Rodgers was thirteen and had several surgeries to relax her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked at her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, I was in total panic.
I thought by the time I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was on my own, and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease here, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair already.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening.”
After several genetic tests, it was found that he had a CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a lucky child,” she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of awareness on CMT to alert to the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turnover of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in a country with an accelerating recovery economy rose slightly last year, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia put $27.6 billion into state and local treasuries for fiscal year 2013, which is 3.8% more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden – both national and local – rose by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were falling.
According to a study by professional firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, government taxes rose faster, by 4.3% than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from corporations.
Virginia, with 28%, has the relatively lowest business tax revenue.
Researchers say the majority of tax revenue growth comes from the increase in the value of property owned by companies, which increased property taxes this year for three consecutive years with a growth of -1% by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the same seems to be true in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2% year-on-year from $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not push up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, many businesses own real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or nonprofits that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also seem to be increasing.
Firms in the region have released a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at a nationwide average of 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax hike was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of 6% in all three counties (all of which have the same taxation).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a more favorable tax climate overall than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher state and local taxes.
A trade tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax—a structure of cost-increasing compensation by price increases that most companies are organized by—in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say the trend and nationwide trade tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments rising to 6.2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington may be lagging behind others because cutting state spending is picking up its tax on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin’s Novorossiysk and Lafat’s scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government units have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the warfare of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, according to him, is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions on Russia?
The Czech Republic has claimed the right to disagree with part of the
The European Commission, together with diplomats, will propose a form of further strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided on tonight.
Reporters were told by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be prepared already on Monday.
Tusk will be the new "President" of the European Union.
Van Rompuy to replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the European Union summit to head the European Council, the so-called EU president, who presides over the summits of member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two-and-a-half years.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of European diplomacy.
Italy, which will become the vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed in office by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not talked about
Helping an incurable and long-suffering patient with a loss of life?
In the Czech Republic, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
Nevertheless, it appears from the statements of doctors who have contacted the LN that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says doctor on sclerosis
In the Czech Republic, approximately three hundred people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergo experimental stem cell treatment in the Prague Motole.
We do not know 100% if it will be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a motor neuroscientist.
It's about knowing the CIA manuscript, they needed war, writes Huml about the shooting down of flight MH17
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Stanislav Huml has made it clear who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were imposed with regard to the shooting down of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead, were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislature, the CIA's manuscript is also known.
Unfulfillable promises.
The elections are approaching and the parties are again offering the impossible.
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for each family and a cable car above Prague.
Before every election, this is repeated: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are overreacting to who the voters will like more.
The Lidovky.cz server chose unfulfillable promises from the present and the past.
Seventy years ago, the Czechoslovaks disembarked at Dunkerque.
Intense siege began.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak separate brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka, constantly requested the addition of technical equipment and the dispatch to the front.
The British eventually complied and included this ground unit as one of their forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.

Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> is the new leader of the football league, leading by a point in front of both Prague "S".
Changes in the top of the table were caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the home league, defeating Jablonec thanks to two Lafat's interventions.
The record win in the year was attributed to Liberec, who shot down Baník Ostrava 6:0.

How to survive a return from vacation?
Don't be in a hurry and get some sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal working pace can be for many nuts.

Joan Rivers' family: "We're keeping our fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the 81-year-old comic will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're holding her thumbs.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a rescue call saying she had a heart attack at a Yorkville endoscopy in the Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
The reactions did not last long, including the incredible support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is distorted by subtitles
That the media are distorting reality with their subtitles is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's bothering me a lot lately, the more accurate is the word annoyance.
This concerns in particular the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines “Israel has attacked Gaza” are quite common.
It is only in the text that you can read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This will be followed by the title "Both sides have violated the ceasefire".
Does the journalistic community realize that by doing so, they are directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany where the crowd shouted the slogans of "Jewish pig" and similar distrust, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews they were destined to kill the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the “Guarding Dogs of Democracy.”
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decides to destroy the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of another fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
When you ask them why they don’t go to “themselves”, such as Gaza, they answer you, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch health care (I have seen with my own eyes how the top-notch private hospital Hadassah, which is funded by sponsorships from Jews from all over the world, is also commonly visited by Arabs and is of course treated there).
Hamas is also targeting its Arab brothers.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus for this restless area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in the headlines.
Report on the practices of Hamas, its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at all costs.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
In nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have flourished thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, of course, the Gazan administrators do not pay and are even angry that at this time the electricity supply is sometimes interrupted.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate Israel, but rather in the construction of dwellings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have a much better life.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed the claim of Information from Monday morning: An Internet retailer – a producer of videos and hundreds of other things – is buying a $1.04 billion ($970 million) video streaming service Twitch.
The announcement came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, Twitche’s sales to Google looked one billion dollars certain, and that connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, was set to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers who broadcast online games on it - the words of Business Insider "YouTube for Live Play".
Twitch interface.
On YouTube there are already popular videos of "Let's play", a kind where wisers (mostly the elderly) give games the processing of the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube in describing Twitch comes to a shock a lot, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn’t excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn’t come out even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Emmett Shear, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us achieve it faster.”
Another mystery is – frankly – the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about just watching games instead of actually playing.
One thing is to watch a friend over her shoulder at three in the morning playing Resident Evil, and a completely different thing is to watch someone stranger get twenty blows to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games that you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is quite a good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of play or humor, their channel on Twitch probably won’t be very interesting.
But what about skeptics like me?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and ranks fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch mixing into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
According to Twitch CEO Shear, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" and the media do not seem to be hesitating, even as - swallowing - viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
The original video is attached.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often put us before the question: Who will you believe?
The Word of God or the Word of Man?
It is as if human inquiry is utterly futile compared to the authority they imagine to have in their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to “the word of God,” they refer to myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator with some purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who has added further series of details to the evolutionary evidence that show exclusivity.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulous.
And it was the people who wrote all the texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not by gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and not gods at all.
If there really were one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an over-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If a being of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, the only holy scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because human authors would not be able to measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If it were written by God, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into more and more separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each claiming somehow God’s guidance, regardless of any continuing disintegration and disintegration.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Qur'an, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathustra's Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered the veracity of the veracity.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the wrong track to some extent.
None of the above-mentioned books has any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of Western Michigan.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defence) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive notions once considered true, which have already been overcome.
Therefore, it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies — with each also possibly containing prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradictions, but rather mutual comments.
We must point out again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness story!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of "Moses," and attribute the authorship of none of them to Moses, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the believer thinks.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Native egypt.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Doce and Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually merged into some kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were discredited and discredited by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these amendments relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and changed Ba'al Zebul, "Lord of the Mountain," to Belzebub, "Lord of the Fly."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Law was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Nikaji Congress.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simple handshakes, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The manner in which the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church in Jerusalem?
What about the church in Rome at the same time?
And gradually they found that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
Thus the core of the canon evolved out of the primitive church.
So the Council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also deliberately removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by approved books.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mix of rumors, parables, and psalms?
The Bible was certainly written by humans and certainly not by too much enlightenment, but on the contrary!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely mistaken, no matter what, from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fireworks, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought using a magic wand to sprinkle blood on someone would cure them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were chewing gums and bats were birds and whales were fish and piss that it was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings have been written about sexism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism, antisemitism
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
However, the creationists are still ignoring this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn’t have their beloved books, they wouldn’t even have a god.
In their world, the one and the other are the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “worshiping creation instead of the creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the rejection of their supposedly "holy" books somehow rejects God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it’s a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God Himself, because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposed "immutable word" of any god has been conceived, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately altered and distorted by mere faulty people.

Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but it couldn't, it was stuck, and I realized something was going on.
Then it happened to me and my sister, you could have laughed, but I had to hurry to the emergency room."
A 20-year-old girl had to be hospitalized to get her jaw back to its original place after participating in a fashionable viral wave on Tuesday.
The video has become an online sensation, shared by thousands of people on Facebook and Twitter.
The attacker stabbed nine people in a Chinese school, three of them died.
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, violently broke into a primary school building in the morning and attacked around half past eleven o'clock local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen later died by jumping from the heights, New China said, citing a regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the first pupils in Lány how he had to sit in school
The youngest students were taken to their classroom, where they and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in the school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, thankfully you are no longer waiting, you are free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first-timers as a gift to the puzzlers.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek has started a new school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education more with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of the Czech Republic approached.
The management of the school recently addressed him at a hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate at the start of the school year," the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, 115,000 first-year pupils entered the first classes.
More than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, according to the Ministry of Education.
Novy’s new art director is David Fiala
The new art director of news and publicity on Nova TV has been David Fiala since September 1.
He replaces Alan Záruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he participated in the realization of complete visual transformation of the news sessions of Televizní noviny, Str<0xC4><0x9B>pina, Prásk! and other publicist programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala manages very well the synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and a purely elegant design, which is the path we want to take in the visuals of Novy’s news,” says Novy’s creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, nude images of celebrities came to the public
Screenshot of the leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on the server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, the US server Mashable.com pointed out.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities deny the images as fake, but already several concerned authenticity of the images have admitted.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for the title role of Katniss in the film series Hunger Games, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played, for example, in The Deadly Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
U.S. magazines reportedly showed interest in the footage, but 4chan reported that the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely a weakness in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server, a tool appeared two days ago that allowed you to obtain passwords to user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool proved to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before the release of this tool.
iCloud users should therefore change their password associated with the Apple ID for preventive reasons.
What matters is the length of the password, not its complexity.
A minimum of 12 characters is appropriate.
The leak of nude images of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are much better secured than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also wise to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone to run only on wi-fi and when connected to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and mainly you will have the space to delete unfinished images, so that they will not take up space in the online storage in vain.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valá<0xC5><0xA1>ek in PDF format.
A smart way to save for a college script
Since the price for a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, a prospective second-year student has come up with a smart way to cut costs.
He invented a system of lending books to high school classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“I got a computational book that normally costs $180 per semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, the average student will spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and gadgets, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder’s become the preferred choice of students.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester book and often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookshops on campuses, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey of the industry shows that around a quarter of books in university bookshops were lent in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Shops, less than half of the texts are purchased in university bookshops.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Buying online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of Ron Larson’s, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler’s “Calculus” book is almost $290, but it can be purchased online at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind other people’s remarks or wear and tear and tear, textbooks are a suitable option.
Chegg.com sells Calculus for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their faculty to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not essential for working in seminars.
If so, the older version may be sold at a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Lending
It is also worth considering the loan of textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the whole semester.
Read the terms and conditions of the business in which you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide a normal e-book instead of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the best offers can be found by students of literary courses, as many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be enrolling in Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you follow the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the Internet, make sure it is really in stock, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from a university bookstore.
The train, the mud itself.
And then they found in the well torso guns from the end of the war
The well is located a short distance from St. George's Church.
We discovered the growth around it and began to pull out a summery layer - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay floor, we stumbled upon a mortar," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it was a torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The finding is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," Novák added.
All wooden construction items have broken down over time, so it is unusable.
However, her body is preserved - it retains its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There's an explanation.
It may have been thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They threw guns in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of hand grenades around, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully touched the mud so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find ends in the museum’s depository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltices.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the captured Czech
Exclusive interview with Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, or the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban in the television debate.
With each such interruption, it was not possible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or the places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests at Majdan.
Yesterday - when we had an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to be 30.
However, there can be many more of them.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but not Czechs yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captive compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers take them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian volunteer flags and the separatists seize them, they will be shot dead without mercy after being interrogated, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men mercenaries, and they say they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers seize a group of Donetsk separatists – including Czechs – they will put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
This guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also behaves as a state in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand that correctly, in return.
Some sources say that it has already exceeded a hundred men.
It’s been a long time since we’ve stopped counting how many people we’ve helped.
But we only freed them... We didn't save them from the war if they decided to keep fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons in war, but we certainly are not.
Well, that's it.
And every day there are more and more.
We'll save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four, sometimes five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it is enough to release prisoners, even a simple human request.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kyiv dubbed me a "crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't offend me.
Maybe that explains the nature of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Corps of Officers, I have gained some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even when it is very uncomfortable for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
What if they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even being caught in a prisoner exchange... this job can mean an end to me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.C.: How many executions and tortures do you know about prisoners?
... (long pause) ... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
What about executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian army is committing such a crime.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, as well as veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to achieve independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have teeth full of oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents – to life and to death.
As I said, they ate it all the way to the throat.
By the way, the same dreams and desires were also revealed at the Maidan.
And now I’m speculating a little bit: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
One speculation is big and the other is small.
But now this sentence of mine hides an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, what do you think of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Whenever I cross the line of the war line, I am unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on a fly or in an optical focuser.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I always see well... and they can press the trigger of their weapons at any time.
He is an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small government in a large Russian empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an unrelenting enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters – in the Ukrainian TV talk show, you called your prime minister Arseniy Yacenyuk a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking I always get at least five times fear.
So why should I hide my opinion that Yacenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.C.: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Yacenyuk "the rabbit".
And in the eyes of Ukrainians, the rabbit is not an animal to be feared or to have respect and authority from others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament in the war, to beg him, to play his intrigues with him, to threaten to put him in office... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest on crying emotions.
He is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save Revenue
The Lost 3 of Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the $90 million budget in the U.S. and Sin City: The Woman for whom I would murder returned only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million over the first weekend, and movies for kids like How to Train a Dragon 2 were a disappointment for movie theaters.
According to the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin’s article, as far as children’s films are concerned, their very quality is at fault.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and How to Train a Dragon 2 called it a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer premieres aired in at least 2,000 movie theaters between Day of the Victims of War and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film crop is of similar quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, the fault may be a change in viewers’ access and the increased popularity of internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Books, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must admit it and not try to chase after what has already been.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash market crisis, Netflix’s earnings from online services reached $1.2 billion, nearly double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on comic book rights, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prediction.
With the introduction of possible big cash outbreaks in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimo<0xC5><0x88><0xC5><0xAF> and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclical". To Hollywood Reporter, he said, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash bursts in history and no one will worry about sales."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of the joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for an invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a site in northwestern DPRK and had reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
There is an underground launch pad for Scud missiles in the province.
This is another of a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were held by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in central Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the city hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters arriving from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains.
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went on a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police at about eight o'clock in the evening.
A search force including local police and a rescue team was dispatched and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls at around 11:00 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit himself in the head.
The policemen stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In stabilized condition, the ambulance transported them to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only one point from Opava, won on foot Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek
Only 23-year-old forvard could decide, but he failed in the two biggest chances.
The goal was scored by the shooter close to three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended on goalkeeper Opava Josef Kveto<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my feet, I have to give that chance.
I'm mad at myself," his ashes spilled over his head.
"Perhaps I should have put it higher under the lid, I was a little bit tired," he thought.
Sigma's defensive side did not allow Opav much, with the exception of Mikul's 11-minute attack, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanatians began to push, but in the block they were prevented from leaving and Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88> caught the missiles from a distance.
We spent 15 minutes comparing ourselves, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek didn’t change his chance, so it ended 0-0,” said Hanák coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvodu.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the set, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99>ík and the three-goal shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D>ík, who are hosts from Sigma in Silesia, were also missing.
Unlike their previous policies, they were not allowed to participate.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma seemed more football-oriented, but we didn’t let her do anything except for one standard,” said Slezan<0xC5><0xAF> coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and combativeness.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma scored four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébro, who after defeating Znojmo conditioned his millionth deposit in the treasury with diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebro's warning, so there can be no talk of the boys not wanting to fight," remarked Calvoda, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I will replace him immediately, so that he can save goals for the next games too," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has impressed Venice twice.
The film industry is experiencing a crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu was one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days gave the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice had somewhat declined.
Either because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because after Birdman there were acclaimed critics, but for viewers less attractive pictures as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s.
The Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet besieged such crowds as in the past and reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a seat at the last minute in the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than anywhere else and it is no wonder that it has affected institutions as respected as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present only in the context of films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully hosted dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the main event was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two movies.
In the Out-of-Competition Transparency story, filmed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on the novel by Philip Roth, Pacino plays a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from end-of-career and personal depression.
But to see him the next day as the strange owner of a farmhouse from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, shot by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's Cup for Best Actor shouldn't miss him - but does the artist still have Pacino's format needed prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian in particular, since although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly reports to the country from which his grandparents come.
Body for Italy
The Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman’s first film to be awarded a long standing applause.
The view of the Calabrian mafia is seen in it by looking at family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the conditions for a good film: quality script, camera, music and actors.
He was also interested in the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher as a woman who almost killed her own child with her own anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not receive warm reception from either the Glory Redemption or the Three Hearts, both works based on the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great movies, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival footage has generally depressing themes, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich titled She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy performed in Venice outside the competition and shot in the style of American cheerleaders of the 1940s, was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police seized four manufacturers of pervitin in Prague, drugs were transported from Poland
"In recent days, detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a woman aged 25 who, from November last year to August this year, produced and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlá<0xC5><0x99>ská street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a seller of benefits.
The following day, the detectives detained another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four policemen were caught on Wednesday morning, August 20, at the Malaysian incinerator site," the spokeswoman said.
A woman was given a third of the drugs for transporting medicines from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the aerospace complex, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags and then sold the pervitin.
With the transport of medicines from Poland or the sale to drug addicts, he was helped by a twenty-five-year-old woman who had not yet been punished.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
On the orders of the judge, the criminals also carried out several home inspections, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other aids and items that can be considered by experts as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been prosecuted seven times since 1995 for property crime, the woman was not prosecuted," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was convicted of a sexual abuse offence in 2006 and the 37-year-old auto mechanic, who is being prosecuted for his freedom, has been prosecuted nine times since 2009.
This was mainly due to property-related crime, too.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, threatening them with up to ten years in prison.
For the three people, the investigator eventually submitted a motion to the prosecutor to place them in custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a thirty-seven-year-old relapser, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as that of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
As part of its other products, Ferrari offers very interesting things at a lot of "interesting" prices.
As a good example, handmade chess with a playing board size of 42 x 42 cm can be found in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43,405 CZK.
The customer will receive a set of wooden black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
It’s no surprise that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse.
If chess doesn’t seem like a valuable gift to you, there’s also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (of course by hand) on a 1:1.8 scale.
The price of this toy is 318,305 CZK.
Disrupting high school and high school doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics show that high school students have good practice.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in the last fourteen days.
These are usually routine matters, such as moving pots from the summer storage back to the classrooms and paving the chalk.
They're going to have a little bigger frmol in high school.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or adultery, the four-year high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice opens and renews its activity after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools managed by M<0xC5><0xA0>MT.
“French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” said France’s key ally, François Hollande.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to “show its support” to a militant socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The president deserves general respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, and took the applause.
As a reconciling gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial French 35-hour working week, despite passionate arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who said she would propose earlier this week.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the socialists to remain "cohesive" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, however, made a line across the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for having “lost faith in the future” because of her.
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extreme right, laughed at the ongoing internal disputes between socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is naked, and they were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And a new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to rule the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and in May an extremely conservative right-wing party succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll published in the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and cut record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are taking place in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will also be no restrictions on dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees before the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish flat-rate gambling on their territory in recent weeks.
But the games will not go away, the gambling decree will not change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.
We wouldn’t even be able to do that technically now, given, for example, the deadlines for commenting and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current delegation, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a ban on gambling will be held on the day of the municipal elections in the Prague 1 and 8 districts.
Currently, gambling is banned, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons, even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
This is complained in particular by Prague 1, which has already sent to the magistrate a proposal for places, for which it would like to extend the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angela.
A decree regulating the curling of dogs is going to the city for several months, but it is not yet completed.
The location of the games and the problem of busking are solved by city decrees.
They may be issued or edited only by the representative office of the capital.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed victory for proponents of Scottish independence at his fingertips
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it nearly placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you will not reach the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to drive the money-changers out of the temple than to have them dictate how to vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond is well aware of this, and that is why he repeatedly asked his rival, the Unionist Darling, in a televised debate, whether he is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters vote for independence, and to start supporting a single currency for Scotland.
Darling was forced to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate.
However, the debate about what Scotland’s currency will be has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported the London bankers in the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not protest the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond put it, "he went to bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous situation for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the “boss” association, to the Confederacy of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly home-absent.
The Scots would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish prime minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it gives him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots should not jump out and have to accept what they are.

Illustrations for the longest year
Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week that was nowhere to be found and we were just rolling around and lingering with Grandma's summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Quick Arrows, already in his fifties, swinging on a bicycle around Imperial up to the back of Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun was flattening his back and shoulders, rays of goodbye clapping.
Evening mild nervousness, still holiday mode, sleeping until the eleventh hour, in a week it will be worse, moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning wake up at the seventh hour.
He's coming Monday.
It usually does not rain, on the contrary, the summer whispers viciously in front of the school.
To navigate in a ghostly light to the screen and feel like a plastic figure in a glass cartoon, there is the school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
Zapotok with a hugely pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more outstretched, girls bustier.
They're ugly out there, avoiding them, but it's interesting how infallibly they hold together and how soon they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls, who came screaming, are now laughing hysterically at something, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything in my life is at its best.
And again, new beginners, some nervous and some delightful, why do they climb here at all?
Because it must, the education war compulsory.
So, inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned nursery with a mope, unfortunately, still the same one that is said to lend the pupil the keys from the tin box, where the textbooks can be kept and there are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the dress remains in memory, it is not done now, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just the idea that your stomach's cramping and your head's starting to hurt.
A head that understands even worse the teachings of mathematics, that devilish game for the elect, among which I am not and will never be.
Again, those three and four, god of five, hide from the rehearsal, fit into the bench and sublimate best, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream for now stories of nicer girls and nicer buildings, but do not take him into the world, about the antennas.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She is threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without the help of a stranger, she gave birth to a little girl who, after cutting off her umbilical cord, she wrapped it in a ready-made blanket, hid it under her jacket, and took it to a roadside trailer, where she laid it down in the bushes several dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me a little sooner.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the bathroom on the bus, I gave birth there.
She was born alive, staring at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors I carried to school," the defendant said, saying she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the body of the child in her backpack and took it away, took the body out of her backpack, wrapped it in a black needle bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>kov Brod," she says in a lawsuit.
It could be tens of minutes, but even a few hours after the birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when inserted under the jacket, undercooling or bleeding from the untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated in the spring of next year.
A woman in the near undiscovered period from February to April 12, when the body of the child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsk, again gave birth in secret.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without verifying whether she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic wraps including a needle bag and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Eventually, a friend revealed it.
The father of the two children was a friend of the accused, who was allegedly unaware of her partner’s pregnancy.
Even for this reason, he is now not in court, only has been punished for a sin against the Funeral Law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was not right, but it came to me as a human at that moment,” the defendant said, noting that she had succumbed to the man’s relationship and was afraid of him.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly well.
She had tears in her eyes until she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She said she didn’t want to kill.
“They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn't buy the kit because I didn't want the kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do it.
I can't explain that to you," she replied to the judge's question.
She refused, however, to act with the intent and intent of killing the newborn.
The second child is said to have been born dead.
During her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I reduced it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also reduced smoking,” she said.
Although she was pregnant in both cases, she claimed to everyone, even after repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was watered.
And a friend too.
The main verdict will continue at the court in Castleton on Tuesday with the statements of forensic experts.
A verdict could be issued on Wednesday.
A woman is at risk of imprisonment for up to 18 years or an exceptional penalty.
Norwegian Cruise Line to Acquire $3 Billion of Prestige Cruises
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world’s third-largest cruise ship operator, has made progress in negotiating the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruises, a $6.8 billion market-value company that competes with larger competitors Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N.) and Carnival Corp. (CCL.N.), has enabled access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy customers.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but warned that talks still may not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruises.
The sources did not want to be named because the talks were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to a request for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruises, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
Twenty-nine billion cruise segments are expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
The companies are competing to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since closing a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruises has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with a tour operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure companies and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise Line launched its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a 28 % shareholding, Apollo 20 % and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documents, the first public offer includes Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises, which together account for 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after vote
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates will participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first get the support of the nomination committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and force pro-democracy activists to renew their promise and paralyze the financial center of Hong Kong with the protests of the “Occupation of the Central” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main source of tension, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining Chinese official authority in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be hosted by Prime Minister Li, will be organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also expected to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government offices this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open talks on "state sovereignty" with eastern Ukraine
According to the description of the events by Russian newspapers, on Sunday Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the separated areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin’s remarks did not mean that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed in order to give the Russian-speaking region the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals is in line with a clear strategy that has guided it since the outbreak of the riots five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the case to the newly-declared Novosibirsk.
In an interview with the first state-run TV channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to recapture the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as "New Russia" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency released Putin’s words that “a prisoner of illusion” is anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government units are attacking civilians.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal issues, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty of southeastern Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s claim to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been in talks with the leadership of Kyiv for several months and that aims to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy can be granted to the eastern regions only by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s intervention, which was supposed to correct Putin’s “wrong interpretation,” highlighted Russia’s leadership’s approach to addressing the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would also have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russian, and pre-conflict opinion polls have shown broad support for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have negotiated on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia’s main navy, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural address on June 7, proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
However, this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed a further insurgency move last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Separatists reinforced by the Russians have taken control of Novoazov with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory in Crimea.
This has accelerated a huge civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combos of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles, a separatist occupiers and 1,000 military units plunged into the area.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were exchanged for 10 Russian scouts captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked came online in the biggest scandal with hacked celebrity photos.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos of Naked Star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the leak from iCloud, personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko were reportedly released.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who filed for Greece’s hand last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should be kept private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
The Greek, who is now in New York, told online newspapers that the hacking is "unshamed" and those who have become its target "feel humiliated".
The hacker is believed to have taken 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him unfolding at the pool top.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where he was her counterpart, Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and thriller actress Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
Lawrence’s TMZ spokesman said: “This is a clear breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers have recovered from Lebra, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunderstorms and lightnings, which the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent down to his subordinate last week, seem to be in the past.
To be from Opava they eventually brought only a point for a bracketless draw.
After all, the dedication and combativeness of the club boss improved a little bit.
The money for the payouts could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr said, adding that despite Sigma not winning, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment that we played in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I can forgive him for not winning.
If we had played like this since the beginning of the season, I think we haven’t lost yet,” Lebr said.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure of the homes, then balanced the game and in the second half it was already better.
After Calvod's victory, the trustees scored, but did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To our complete satisfaction, we were missing only one transformed opportunity," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the players was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Either on my part, on the part of the coach, or on the part of the fans," Lébr said.
Pressure must be calculated by Sigma
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Completely without comment then left a question on Lébrov's statement from last week attacker Václav Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not change Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's match.
Afterwards, however, he spoke a little bit about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
Everybody's trying to get on us.
“Today, we showed that if we fight and everyone rides on their ass, we can do it,” he said.
They took the warning to heart.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not pretend that preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was clear that they took Mr. Lebro's warning to heart.
Even before, it wasn’t about not wanting to fight and pushing it away,” said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to compare ourselves to the toughness and realize what the second league was all about.
“It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
All that remains is to hope that in the next games Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
