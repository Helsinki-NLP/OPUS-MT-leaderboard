Members of the Welsh Assembly worried that they "look like fools"
Concern has spread among some members of the Assembly over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This came as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may provoke mockery.
A Labour Party assembly member said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "fool" and pwp means "crazy".
A member of the Welsh Party said the whole group was "dissatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the germ "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the germ "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to announce the change of name, said: "Of course, the final decision on the appointment of Assembly Members will be up to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly a waiver to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation, and the latter's proposal to designate the assembly as the "Welsh Parliament" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of Assembly Members, the Commission favoured the designation "Wales Parliament Members" or "WMP", but the "MWP" alternative found more support in a public consultation.
Apparently, Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could turn into a heads-up for President Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the way the assembly operates, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly Members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, final votes on the issue of their nomination will remain with the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum to change the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was set in an effort to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has expressed that he will not recognize the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the older people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
"They're both missing today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“Nowadays, people socialize in other ways,” he says.
"Bars are no longer the meeting point of the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by dwelling palaces full of such people that they would not support the holy places left in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy homes in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches will be closed once and for all, as it is unprofitable for the majority of people who settle in these dwellings to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of black people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of black people, who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of people of color under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's famillies made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the career.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the career "the bell of the poor."
The expert who played in the career in July called it something entirely different: "a cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first career in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger career at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated confession of architects and contractors, some sent by secular church leaders and others from the episcopal diocese.
The council - the governing body of the family, made up of secular leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, worrying that it would "try to transfer costs" to the family council, despite the latter not being involved in the hiring of architects and contractors.
Some family members complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old During Dive to Catch Squirrels in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to catch squirrels in California on the opening day of the squirrel season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with several friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then had driven towards him along with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought the boy was just exultant from catching some skull, but then "I realized he was yelling, 'Bitched me!
He bit me!"
Hammel expresses that when he reached the boy, he saw that his entire clavicle was torn.
"I shouted to everyone coming out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coastguard captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago but had been identified as a non-hazardous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large-store-style cosmetic pavilions, with a specialized sales staff.
In the context of a significant effort to enter the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is continuing to grow as sales of fashion clothing and home furnishings are declining, the largest cosmetics pavilions in the world will fall, and the largest cosmetics pavilions in the world will be tested.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelf spaces that were once used for televisions, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sainsbury's has said it would double its range of cosmetics products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with areas dedicated to the respective brands, similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Also, the supermarket will once again market its Boutique cosmetics line, so that most of the products are made with vegan ingredients - something that is increasingly in demand from buyers of younger ages.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food on a daily basis in the neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said outlets will begin to resemble larger stores, as the supermarket network tries to fight down Aldi and Lidl with more services and products per day.
Sainsbury's has set up "Argos" outlets in hundreds of stores and has introduced a range of "Habitats" since the purchase of the two networks two years ago, which he said has boosted food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a merger with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger broke up after a debate over how to split revenue from pharmacies into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business from 281 Celesio stores, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetic pavilions to improve the environment in favor of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands has been designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are already an attractive cosmetic destination, which makes a difference from the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'shocked' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragons Dan" star Peter Jones has left "ghosted" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks" and "Spencer."
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of household appliances and accessories "Truly".
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old actress of "This Morning" turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered the "Dragons Dan" star, Peter Jones, after pulling at the last moment from their lucrative business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV."
Sources say Jones was "ghosted" when the TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new home deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant "no one had time for me."
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double its estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11m worth of assets.
While Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce her departure from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw left all the people involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
In the offices in Marlow there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of "This Morning," which is among the UK's most successful stars, could cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to her garments and home furnishings, and the cause of the fall.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its CEO in March.
The couple spend their holidays together and Jones holds 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
It's a tough conversation, and then I fall in love."
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the media because of his comment, which some would call "unworthy of a president," and because of the positivity about the North's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump mockingly imitated the voice of the newscasters.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, saying the North sees no "corresponding response" from North Korea to the U.S.'s first step.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping under pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things are going best with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We've got a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - halting missile testing, helping to release hostages, and returning home the rest of the U.S. military.
In his speech on relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign nonprofits were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok, no national disaster was declared, which is a precondition for the catalysis of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear on many occasions that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the frequent earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing, the country remains extremely unprepared in the face of nature's anger.
While shelters against the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are hardly encountered in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has used the improvement of Indonesia's shaky infrastructure as a central point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has disturbed Mr. Joko's administration, as he faces new elections to be held next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after Christian and Muslim groups clashed in the streets, where hangars, bows and arrows, and other cold weapons have been used.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores an equaliser against Chelsea in the last minute
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball slightly to his left before making a hit to the far-off gate.
The ball flew over the area until it diverted towards the top and right corners of the grid.
The ball escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga's air jump and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls forward, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and I didn't think too long but I just hit."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blues forward made a rematch to Mateo Kovacic during that game, before turning near the field and sprinting towards Liverpool's half-field.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the midfield.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical aftermath that brought Hazard out into the area.
Hazard crossed the defensive into a speed duel and with a left-hander hit he scored in the second pole, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have been trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-front earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet tall, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference.
The city of Paul, with a population of more than 380,000, has been credited under the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Suspicion of Murder After Woman Finds Death from Knife Injury
A murder investigation has been announced after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward for evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would like to call any person who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
"Also, I would like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured footage, to contact us as they may have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body has been found inside a dwelling.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, while police have said they are notifying the victim's family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out about the incident.
Now, residents are being informed that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived at the scene of the crime.
She keeps repeating the words "this is awful."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside.
A number of officers were stationed inside the perimeter, monitoring the residential block.
Any person with information is requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers" anonymously at 0800 555 111 by choosing the code 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the last monument affected by the debate over the "rewriting of history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artefacts by his puritanical fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the midst of the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable to mark Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a mistaken sacrifice by Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many think deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, which in his case was certainly the monarchy.
The fact that this is a completely accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig killer wounds Chinese farmer to death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", has been found dead with a ruptured artery and covered in blood near a pig stall in Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject the pig vaccine into a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and uncovered the door of a pig stable next door.
He said there was a big pig in the stall with a bloody mouth.
A medical examination has confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs have wounded the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and crooked," said his cousin, identified by the surname "Wu," as quoted in evening news in Guiyang.
In footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has confessed to the evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been noted before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer behind his tractor, until his wife drove the animal out.
After a Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that usually pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a "stimulant."
"They just want to play.
They're like very curious little girls... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
The consequences of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring large-scale rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is softening as it moves towards the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will cause rainfall as a result of floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa was accompanied by winds at 85 miles per hour, being classified as a Category 1 hurricane, and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure atmospheric zone is beginning to form, which is moving eastward, towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will be a major tropical storm.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of rainfall in parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical moisture with the low atmospheric pressure zone will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste leakage and possible landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause the rainfall rate in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall are predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions, due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfall, it is not advisable to walk through the desert on foot.
The heavy rains can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and the hurricanes will bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The approach of the low-atmospheric pressure zone will bring heavy rainfall to some parts of California's southern coast.
The total rainfall level can reach over half an inch, which can cause small leakage of debris and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the rainfall spreads further on Monday and Tuesday evening.
The heavy rains will spread to all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by high temperature fluctuations, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start October at warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the Southern Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high odds for above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have attended the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the last-minute turn of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and tried to distract him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a blatant testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been higher than that of the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Figures for other broadcast networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to be high even after the end of the court session.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he faced the screams of protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to go to court.
On CNN's live broadcast, he appeared with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was being reprimanded.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power, while there are so many powerless women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee meeting.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Judiciary Committee would vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for a vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so with the conviction that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate over the next week, as the Democratic minority had demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was clever, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview adjoining that on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called "Chequers," saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should levy taxes on each other's account is "abstract."
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson for Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU team.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison premises on unintended murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Directorate said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
Police have found the glasses at the scene and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, reports CBS's WAFB affiliate.
After being questioned by Simpson, police said he admitted that he had shot at Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Eastern Municipality's Forensic Medical Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The department thanks the refugee task force near the Louisiana State Police, the state police's forensic lab, the Southern University police and citizens of the area for their assistance with the investigations that led to the arrest of the author.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for their "zeal and for bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "saddened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"We're worried about that all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spills fire over Mexico City
Grace from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was revived and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a series of thunderstorms and swings.
Images on social media showed layers of ash that had covered the windows of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the volcano's activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude quake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with peaceful police forces, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and powder paint creating dark dust clouds through the streets that are usually eaten by tourists.
Later in the day, there were also crashes, while the police had to use rubber sticks to end the collisions.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan "We do not forget, we do not forgive", pro-independence groups faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
In a region where sentiments for independence prevail, tensions continue to be high even one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite low turnout, as citizens boycotted the votes against secession.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting through polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protests continued, but were forced to take another turn.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in last December's local elections achieved a vital victory, although with a narrow result, Catalan pro-independence parties have had a hard time preserving the hovine this year, as many of their most well-known leaders either have voluntarily left the country or are in detention without organising and holding their roles.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone to help police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counter the regression of democratic values and the pressure that the Spanish government has put on us," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested after car crashes into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car collided several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage to the main gate and the apartment itself was caused.
It is believed that at some point an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's hit gives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 games as the team's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit was decisive while Gary Holt's team tied second-place Hibernian by a point.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field match in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday will face the Hearts, with a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will wait at home for Rapid Vienna, in the European League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of consecutive wins to six games and coach Holt hasn't proven the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against well-decided opponents
Holt's team should have spent many minutes ahead before scoring, as their direct attacks caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but knocked weak at the goal, and then Alan Lithgow knocked out in the upside-down slide after a header by Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in standard strikes.
That's the goal that set the meeting.
The Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating Menga's opportunity, who hit and scored in the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the holding of the ball but the local defense had proved invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly ever put to the test.
This way of playing continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's kick was halted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor while Lithgow kicked out of another Livingston standard kick.
The hurdles were constantly coming to the Livingston area and being cleaned up, while the two claims for penalties - after Halkett's intervention against substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for touchdown - were not taken into consideration.
The 'Fenomenal' Game by Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni
It's a great performance and performance for Livingston.
For a man, they played great and continued to exceed expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a big credit goes to Holt for how he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
"Although they played very well under Gerrard's direction on some occasions, they lacked quality.
Missing the final pass - only once managed to pass the opposing defense - and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is expected with suspicious feelings in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by a smile of blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have been at odds over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters took to the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor adored as a hero by some German Turks and despised as an autocrat by some others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car crash
A cyclist has died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulances arrived immediately, but the victim died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the cyclist left the scene, which took place on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and to notify his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have been notified to use other roads, while drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lattin Prison: Six officers injured in rebellion
Six prison officers have been injured during a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The rebellion erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and is still ongoing.
Tornado specialist officers have been called to keep the riots under control, involving eight inmates and who are confined within one side of the prison.
Officers have received treatment at the scene for some mild facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been mobilized to keep under control the incident currently taking place at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may receive extensions of imprisonment."
HMP Long Martin is home to over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had undergone treatment in the hospital after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peacekeepers were summoned to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can be an advantage for drought areas)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, this is most likely exactly what will happen in the first days of next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwestern Desert, spreading risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued immediate flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching in the late hours of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas out of danger of immediate flooding, Rosa's rains could be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these rains may be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme second-class droughts," weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is battling cold water over the Pacific, and as a result it is losing power.
As a result, it is expected that the hurricane will hit Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Rainfall over some areas of Mexico may be severe, posing a considerable risk of flooding.
"Rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to Northwestern Sonora, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico, in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its consequences are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause immediate flooding with a threat to life, leakage of waste into deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Remaining Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of remaining attempted murder after a 16-year-old was wounded with a knife in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace area around 4 a.m. BST on Saturday.
He was admitted to the hospital, where he is currently in "sustainable" condition.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for appearances for anyone who may have captured video footage of the incident with a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and cruel tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony during the hearing in connection with her accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote in favor of one of the most thoughtful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president repeatedly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm going to contribute," he said.
"That's why I'm trying so hard and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to make "blocked resistance."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami as numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by giant waves that crashed on beaches when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) of height collided with the shore in the dusk, devouring the lives of many people and destroying everything that came forward.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-front earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat of a tsunami was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, told a news conference.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it took cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed into the tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a glass surrounded by water.
The quake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about three times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic position of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have multiplied the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "very large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the extent of damage could be much higher along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communication networks were "completely interrupted without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for failing to give notice of the tsunami, despite officials saying the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In amateur footage distributed on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by down the road for the arrival of the tsunami with furious screams.
Within minutes, a wave collides on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately verify the film's authenticity.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which cut communications across the country, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aid jets from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people continue to have great needs for food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is quite difficult.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived without any problems in the city of Palu, where workers are sheltering in tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They tell me they've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite difficult.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to put humanitarian aid mechanisms in motion, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being barred from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can ask for national help, but this status has not been given yet."
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the missing still had hopes that the case of their loved ones would be one of those few miracles that sometimes occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachuting team, had trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people locked up at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of parachuting, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the parachuting community, he had desperately tried to write on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his messages only ended with a grayscale mark, instead of the two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during the refill of an ATM in Newport, Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was replenishing an ATM in Newport, Levee.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM at an entertainment center and was trying to cash in on others, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy at work, someone "runned from behind Brink's employees" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has long been nicknamed Ye, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the show, which can't come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current art name, West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious meaning to it.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"It's me, it's you, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the one," to simply "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the many celebrities who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he stated that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, Jay-Z, has done the same with or without a partition visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing a total of 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were raging across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving students monthly grants and opening more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount spent on research in this field, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the U.S. lacking an official general strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Declining the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big discovery in this field," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the odds of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," which was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the world's most prominent artificial intelligence+ companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that passed on to the leading American player at Othello, and then worked as an executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China branch.
Lee hailed the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Field, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the U.S. need to work hard to get grants from the government.
“It’s not China that’s driving away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the title of doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers funding for individuals in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Selective Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next."
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been enforced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked NATO's efforts in its efforts.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubts on whether participation in the election will reach the 50 percent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the disintegration of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have binding power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents erected by referendum boycotters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not by entering through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't love us by the name of Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would “confirm our future.”
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 percent of the participants had plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
For a successful referendum, the participation rate should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong blow to the pro-Western government's policy, since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute seem extraordinarily easy.
Argentina's shooter took a pass in the midfield at the start of the action.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before going out on the open field.
Afterwards, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed a defender and crossed into a speeding duel several others at the entrance to the Brighton area.
Then he went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker took advantage of his exit in the area to follow the ball Agueros, who struck with his right and overtook goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball at the right corner of the grid.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in Brighton's half.
He verticalized nicely for Laroy Sane on the left arm.
Sane took a few steps forward before heading towards Sterling on the second pole.
The attacker of the blues led the ball into the net and then slipped out of the boundary lines.
City will face Hofenheim on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of the "flyers" against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminators, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff opportunity for the Rockies, who have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies reached at least one playoff opportunity thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to win the division title.
"Although we are playing without any motive, at least we can score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level that I can face throughout the year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the headliner on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to leave Scherzer in such a situation to start the meeting.
Scherzer, for whom the 34th would appear as the headliner, held a training session on Thursday and could appear on the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
The Washington player, who shoots right, is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shots this season.
Trump gathers West Virginia at a rally
The president cited the situation overwhelmingly regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"August is crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrific group of radical Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they have divided their minds to regain their power in any way, you see their shame and their filthiness.
They don’t want to know who they hurt, who they’re squeezing to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to make "blocked resistance."
"And you've seen this in the last few days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, cruel, dirty and unfaithful."
He referred to Democratic Speaker of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which sparked outrage among the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you get the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, uh, no, I... wait a minute... - her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an open church.
She's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted in favor of the motion of no confidence in me, I wasn't so impressed.
After all, I'm not the first of the Labour Party MPs to be told they're not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, related to national security and Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight-year term as a local Labour Party MP, the GC meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more polite" policy has long been forgotten, if ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views began to claim that I was taking a 180-degree turn and holding positions with which I would have never agreed - either on national security or on the B-market.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - criticism explodes on social media, with people seeking my dismissal, denouncing the center's policies, telling me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who has experienced this.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but don't shy away from it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "open church," and with every move of faith and with every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I have been often advised to lower my head, not be so noisy, and so that everything "will be fine".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the neglect of Thatcher's government that led my class to failure in a general school, I have tried to lobbied for better public services for those in need - whether as a local mini-member or as a member of anyone.
"I've never hid my politics, even in the last election.
"Everyone in Nottingham East has made clear my political stances and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
For all those who voted in favor of the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible father leads the lists
Two late attempts may have somewhat changed the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They are now the only invincible team out of 10 teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks that ensured the victory for the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was completely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so normally I'm happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "We want to congratulate Ayr, who took more risks than we did.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, returned to goal by Frazier Climo, overtook Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show a buck behind him and show his superiority.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and turned to goal an individual action leading the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, returned to goal by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Thereafter, there was a long pause as a result of Ruaridh Knott's severe injury, which left with a barrel, and after the resumption of the game, Ayr increased the score through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was subsequently punished with a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited the fact that they had one more player, with an unsuccessful attempt at goal by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressed piece.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with a yellow card for blocking Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson "touched down", behind Ayr's forward-moving three-man back.
Climo scored and did the same nearly after the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward attacking player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of "Still Game" seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, with co-writer and co-protagonist his longtime partner in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a sea exit hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an improvisation of the naval fleet headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have raised the blue flag of the ocean.
At the base of the Titicaca Sea in the Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
It's a task to get him back."
Throughout Bolivia without a breakaway, the memory of taking the coast from Chile into a bloody conflict over resources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as is the desire to sail once again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hovi, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course, it is awaiting the outcome with positive expectation," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks in order to give Bolivia a landslide.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for a second term in next year's election - Monday's decision is quite important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the courts are very unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and that even if they did, they would change very little.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the right to give another state part of Chile's territory, and it has expressed that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is coming out with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the matter "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping the cause of Bolivia, the events of the last four years may have penalized him.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has wiped out every trace of kindness left to the Chileans, she suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly swift.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a "chance to end 139-year-old disputes, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to understand that we have to leave behind the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't take place as long as it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will not carry out nuclear disarmament first, as long as it can't trust Washington.
The young man was giving a speech on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy so far "sleeping", just three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, the hopes that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration on the end of the Korean War will cause North Korea to kneel are futile hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament moves, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to withdraw its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon come to the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide complete protection from the sun's rays, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of odd giant hats for their SS19 collection in the hallways, which left all the stylists open-minded at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have taken root on Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought out their surprising creations.
Valentino's special creation was a very extravagant beige hat, adorned with a wide hut with similar details to the beads, which surrounds the model's head.
Other great accessories included stone-decorated shawls, a magic hat and even a pineapple - but they're not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - together in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than like haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear, also filled with the air tube and glasses of water, while another resembled a bag of melted ice cream.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant chapels may soon come to the streets of your city.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of La Bomba, the straw hat with the wide two-legged shelter, which we've all seen, ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand hiding behind the highly impractical hat that took off through social media brought out another huge creation on the wings - a beach bag made of straw, almost as large as the swimwear model that was carrying it.
The bright orange-coloured raffia bag, decorated with a raffia point and a white leather handle on top, was the most distinctive creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the streets of cities - as the stylist has left an impact so great that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results in exams, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at the highest levels, for their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the branch of modern languages continues to be a widespread and preferred choice throughout schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language that they understand, your words are heard.
If you speak to him in your own language, your words are in his heart.”
These words are a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of last year's exams, we can find that languages are leading the lists of results, with the highest rate of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have received a maximum A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had received the maximum A score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied for German, 69 percent of those who studied for French and 63 percent of those who studied for Spanish also received A score.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as the branches of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties employers faced in filling vacancies, 17% of them were related to lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs that require the proficiency of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as a master of such a long-term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only one-hundredth of people to speak a foreign language.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
The proficiency of many languages, especially the proficiency of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a range of languages from which you can choose in private schools, with pedagogical staff consisting of specialists in the field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "weaponize" them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future.
In these times, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as truly a "skill of international communication."
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is set to debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for the Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's not yet known how many minutes he's going to play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
A Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallyes tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such gatherings planned to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval suspended for his election to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November votes take place.
What time is Trump's rally taking place today in West Virginia and how to follow it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. Eastern Time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings at the Supreme Court of candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over accusations of his sexual misconduct, with the Senate's expected vote of confirmation remaining suspended for a week while the FBI conducted a probe.
But the primary purpose of these multiple rallies is to help Republicans take a leap forward in the November election.
President Trump's campaign staff said these five meetings next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans strive to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we approach the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia's Metro News news agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the country where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has lagged behind, according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows willingness to fight while keeping hopes alive by turning to singles races on Sunday
"After three one-way seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This vibration, is a totally created sporting concept, but a concept where players truly and never more than in such races.
Where can we say that we're feeling this pain now?
"They had a six-point gap that's now gone to four, so we can say it's created some kind of a bump I think," Spieth said.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points ahead, when they remain in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope the odds are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, especially by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and where they scored three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been ruthless from the start of the shooting to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The party's bragging increased as the round went on, introducing the golf ball with an easy kick to lead the match to a draw, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His light shot that gave them the victory of the match in pit 15 was met with a similar acclaim, which shows he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has achieved four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to not catch a shot over the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting over the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday evening and on the second nine shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way in which their energy seems to flow towards the enthusiastic crowd and vice versa reinforces the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday and that there will be no other player more well-known than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible victory at the National.
Possibly both at the same time in different holes.
However, there are still premature declarations of a European triumph.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four games, when he fell in pairs with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two two to nine ahead put the Spaniard and the Swede in a pit from which they had no chance to get out anymore.
However, on Sunday, no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
Quad and couple games are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change there for there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the final, but these four sessions also showed that the U.S. team will still fight even though some people, especially Stateside, have cast doubt on this.
Europe leads 10-6 as it heads towards the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a substantial advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the four-match and couples games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods to boost their four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team in the morning's doubles, leading to a 3-1 set of results.
The U.S. team showed more endurance in the four-match game, winning two games, but they couldn't narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches on Sunday to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari, dubbed 'Molliwood', are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in Game Four, they combined well enough to beat a powerless Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely played two games on Saturday, showed occasional explosions of majesty, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the four-match and seven-match series.
Justin Rose, who retired for the fourth game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the couples game and took a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have everything in favor on a pretty beautiful and cool day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the difference to be caught by the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four games and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the couples games after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team has returned the score after a four-point difference in individual games, although Furyk's holding team only needs a draw to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to go beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not disarm “in any way” unilaterally without gaining confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening the distrust of the United States and the country would not relinquish its nuclear weapons in any way unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important measures that show goodwill" in the past year, such as banning nuclear and missile tests, dismantling areas where nuclear and nuclear tests were conducted, and deploying nuclear weapons.
"However, we are not seeing any response related to this from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will not be self-confident and under these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-phase" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be assessed because of the gradual steps it has taken, his statement did not seem more important.
The young man referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a U.S. president in office and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear decommissioning" the Trump Peninsula's intercontinental nuclear arsenal.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said it should first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea, according to the report.
"The United States insists that 'nuclear disarmament' be carried out initially and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, even by opposing 'the declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can get us on our knees is the sunshine dreams of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our mistrust."
He did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party to the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the process of nuclear disarmament without the U.S. would not have happened on the island."
Despite this, the tone used in the New Speech was profoundly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that placing the U.S. territory under targeting by North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President Trump's assassination."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions should not continue until Korea's sanctions are lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for it, saying "whether it will take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penian for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we complete the verification and complete it."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end funding for Penian's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Young aside at the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Peniani again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left Peniani in July, saying there had been progress, and only within a few hours of North Korea denouncing him as having carried out "mafia-style demands."
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to disarm a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he demanded were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has involved all students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of study 'masks' through the use of caffeine by these 'painless'.
One academic noted that students at the number one university in the world often don't know when it comes to the most basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the lecture course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a briefing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why is this being told to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep before — something that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the essential elements of how habits of good sleep help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's medical services, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course, which lasts one hour, involves a series of interactive tasks.
On one side is a view of a guest room, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, athletes and books in order to be explained the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of riding the clock.
In another part, participants are explained how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attack, ischemia, depression and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that students' behaviors will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know, the health impact when choosing to smoke," said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend “a sleepless night” continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation takes the brain into a hunger mode, making them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should set a clock with bells on when to go to bed, and also on when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of the ‘blue light’ coming out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can bring out the biological rhythm of the work.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's sons
The Rangers took another hit as visitors as Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard's broken side a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking to record his first win since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 games Gerrard as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the leader of the fleeing Premiership Labro.
Menga scored seven minutes before finishing the first half and with a Rangers team setup that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
While the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is right behind Hibernian for goal difference.
Rangers may expect to have more trouble after their wing player Calum Spence was treated for a headshot after being hit by an object likely to be thrown by visiting fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, pitched the same 11th who took a Hearts point last week and that he would be pleased with the way his well-organized team beat opponents in each round.
Rangers may have dominated in holding the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in possession.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass Menga gave to Scott Pittman in the gate frame defended by Allan McGregor, was not properly used by him by firing the ball out.
A long cross from the penalty kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out in the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they hoped more than they actually believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after four hours of play as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers managed to score two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not worried about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's powerless kick.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen on the field, no one can deny that they deserved it only for the fight they showed.
Again, the Rangers failed in long-distance service for the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball against Scott Robinson, who kept calm to pass Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted on a break between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change almost gave an immediate effect while the side followed Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his position to block him.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play as they wish, where Lithgow and Halkett followed each other with long balls from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed another penalty during the game, while he was confused with the Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the lead.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, as today 136 years ago and IN VAZHDIM... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger meter.
A major pillar of science since then, the Geiger meter has also become a major pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado Days, with a cast of seemingly non-professional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "discern" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "discern" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can ‘excrete’ a protein commonly found in many cancers and then be re-injected
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients who have certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they ‘separate’ a protein commonly found in some cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of some cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the inscription MAGA, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West whispered protests in the studio during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live after a disappointing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called “Ghost Town,” where he was wearing a hat on his head that read “Make America Great,” he continued to speak with strong voices against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Whenever I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with a parody starring Matt Damon, where Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission on allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's harsh speech recordings were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with that post or not.
West also complained to viewers that he had spent a difficult time in the backstage because of what he had put in his head.
"They beat me in the back.
They said, ‘Don’t go on stage with that hat on your head.’
They've abused me!
And then they tell me I'm drowned," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the sunken one?", saying, "I put my superman hat on my head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments were buzzed at least twice by spectators and members of the SNL cast appeared to feel ashamed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was called as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most courageous souls: THANK YOU WHO ARE IN THE BALL OF STORY."
But broadcast moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just herself and that's extraordinary."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or clothes or supporting his 'art'), who I believe is embarrassing and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already "the guy who used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and also later musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
‘Game of Thrones’ star Kit Harington enjoys toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a swordsman in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the male hero's stereotype, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen makes young boys realize they have to behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the era of the #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite important" to solve the issue.
"Personally, I feel this issue is quite important at the moment - where did we go wrong with the show of masculinity?" he said.
"What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we're facing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the overly masculine characters appearing there.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel like men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how to change this?
"Something's wrong with the kids."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for Game of Thrones as the series ended at the end of next summer, saying "the battlefields and the horses have come to the top of his nose."
Starting in November, Kit will take part in a stage re-enactment of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's gotten from Game of Thrones.
"In this production I found a woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning science fiction series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the Leslie family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, showing a difference from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV through this method had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines for the treatment of HIV as part of an effort to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data has been disseminated by staff members, saying these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and an online "extreme-right" website.
"Lies, lies, and just disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing for sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had been questioned by Kavanaugh.
Some conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and extracted data from a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded claim is utterly untrue and a big lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and savage claims - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement immediately faced online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is done in a frustrating way," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be nervous.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He needs to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing extremely nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great growth, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had flagged "relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false allegations."
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all of their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on everyone in my staff."
"Johnny English Strikes Again" is a comedy film directed by Rowan Atkinson.
It is a coincidence that in every new British-influenced film, hidden messages related to the theme of Brexit are seen and this finds application also in the revival on the stage of the comedy-action entrepreneurship "Johnny English" - which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and "Johnny English" in 2011.
Will this satirical comedy show how clearly incompetent we are about new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the eye-catching character comes out of the country, with his gum-like face and seemingly unfamiliar Johnny English, has received authorization to confuse things a second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a wide-ranging comic creature designed for non-French-speaking, English-speaking territories.
Of course, he is a flawed secret agent, who despite surprisingly claiming to appear as enchanting, has little of Inspector Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean's character and a portion of that guy who contributed only with the release of a sound in the 2012 Olimpic "Chariots of Fire" song.
It is also based on the mystery man, traveler and international Atkinson, who once played in television commercials that have now been forgotten by Barclaycard, leaving the country in chaos wherever it stepped.
There's one or two great moments in this movie.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval coat of arms and the helix leaf slammed slightly into his helmet.
This is where Atkinson’s physical comedy gift comes in, but humor seems empty and sometimes excessive, especially when ‘serious’ films such as 007 and Mission Impossible have put a little bit of comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and Johnny English's crisis events are not so creative and are focused on silent movements, the same as those that Atkinson performs in the character of Bean.
The constant theme, as in this film, is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British agents, revealing the identities of British field agents, and harassed the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a pompous and battle-ready figure, who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character that resembles Teresa May, but there's not much text in the script that can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that any active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but who unofficially taught how to become a secret agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of a rock school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and reunites with his former assistant, multi-year-old Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used little mistakenly for this role.
So Batman and Robin's making things totally backwards in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, wrestling with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinated by the enticing tech billionaire who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their funny and enjoyable odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Voltaire without permission; and English is utterly confused as he tries to use the familiar home-made appliances of Virtual Reality.
All sequences are normally made for the final scene, but despite being fun and noisy, everything looks a bit like a children's movie.
It's pretty moderate things.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Isn't there a role in the British film industry for Rowan Atkinson that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days a week, but be paid for five days.
The Jeremy Corby-led Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants corporate bosses to save money using the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see that employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but continuing to bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would “match” with the party’s economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favor of workers.
Passing into a week of four working days is an idea embraced by the Trade Union Congress, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen right away, but a four-day week is an aspiration consistent with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of employees and also with the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A week of four working days is not the party's policy and is not being taken into account by the party."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to guide his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to shift power from "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" to public service firms.
The chancellor’s shadow plans also imply that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the Labour government may carry out ‘discounts’ on the grounds of actions considered violations.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create Comprehensive Property Funds to pass on to employees 10 percent of private sector firms' capital, which means a dividend paid annually worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy show in "60 Minutes," if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions whether the findings of the investigation bureau could influence any Republican senator to retire.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his college in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got on the phone after this happened, so after the allegations came out, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was very clear and clear."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
"I've shared the thought of Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only be made by some bomb accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical show that features a large and impressive list of stars who perform and also have an equally impressive mission; to end the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome crowds of thousands at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to become aware of the true purpose of the show, until the end.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket for their show (except for the case when you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a number of duties, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, performing a call-up call or any other way.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade them to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what's known as "click activism" - people who feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" is said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving a boost to various goals.
It is said that these actions have helped incentivize world leaders to declare $37 billion worth of political commitments, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or insured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include "The Power of Nutrition", an active partnership of investors and enforcement agencies based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising that they would "give Rwanda a lot" of "$35 million" to help.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," The Power of Nutrition Ambassador told the crowd at a live concert in London.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition," that will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website, he asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like every supreme civil right and as movements against apartheid ahead of us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the actors who will perform at this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the navy for "blockades" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington could rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from spreading across markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there is a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a nonprofit organization that has personified itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, highlighting that these approaches are practically the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a deceptive mess" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration embarked on a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is supposed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of trouble when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Elizabeth Warren will think seriously" if she runs for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously think" of taking part in the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a rally in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and regulate our ruined government and that includes putting a woman on top," she said.
"After November 6, I'm going to consider running for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before the vote, we need an FBI investigation."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large proportion of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for running, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing the candidacy.
Other high-profile Democrat names that have been discussed to compete in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Paul, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being called into the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my son is going through, what he's experiencing after he's back, can connect with other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told attendees at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans, "come a little changed, hardened, come thinking if they get proper respect from the soldiers and aviators of other members of the military, for what they have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and gunshots while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal opposition to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county filed an explanatory document as friends-to-judge in Washington on Friday in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who are supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a high number of asylum seekers in the U.S. because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeking policy returned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal laws require that all applications for asylum be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," the friend-to-judge report stated.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on migrants was damaging the U.S. economy, saying their chances are to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political belief," Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum is never meant to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
To the survivors, the situation was very good.
"The situation feels pretty tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who was carrying her sick little son to an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palusa.
"The ambulance brings the corpses every minute.
There is no more clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, dragging their belongings soaked in water, in an effort to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-front earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were taken to a military hospital outside Palusa, where patients are being treated in outdoor settings because earthquakes are still ongoing.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered when he felt the violent quake in the fifth-floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save myself.
I think I was squeezed under the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard the woman crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Propaganda Advertisement’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that promoted the joint benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections held on November 6.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington's escalating campaign to increase pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war over which has seen tariffs equalize on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts said China's retaliatory tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Ioua, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the longtime U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote, "China is already doubling this bullying by placing propaganda ads on our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, China's government is being helped by the American ecclesiastical tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in street newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's troubling economic trajectory, since the media is under China's strong control," he said.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided the offer to publish his article," despite not telling which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are changing women voters ahead of midterm elections following Kavanaugh scandal
The more the Republicans' main characters solidarize and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in front of some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on the subject have been too high, and many Republicans have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't be overturned," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute attempt at an FBI investigation and that it would be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national advisor and spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Night is coming!" as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors while Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach its peak," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People are saying it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women's undecided voters in the outskirts and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even ahead of Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a harsh reaction if Republicans continued to support the candidacy.
"This has turned into a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh is going to sit in the defendant's bank, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've handled that woman," Prijoc told NBC News.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in vigiling Ford and Kavanaugh's evidence, with the latter having a slightly higher backing.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think Kavanaugh has likely or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as the other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open-source platform, called Solid.
'Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access a certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "storage of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about storing personal data on the network is the fact that it is entirely up to the user what kind of information they will access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes, and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several contracted developers to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google whether or not they should introduce a total change where all of their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on the Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's independence debate.
While founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of networking," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Donation of the Victorian Cross during the First World War for the clergy
The only clergyman to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a warrior has been commemorated in his native country, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the commemoration appeared exactly 100 years after the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the hail of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great tremor" led the battalion forward and grabbed one of the weapons on the battlefield and alone killed three people from the opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, settled by a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is being shown by the support that is being given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to follow the Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derrkucen Pepa"
Imagine, you've stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and then you're taken away from the opportunity to watch this main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 battles, including six battles in the base package, and would air in real time overnight on Channel 5, in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to show Derrkucen Pepa.
Some remained dissatisfied after staying up all night until the early hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described the move from the match to a children's cartoon as "an ugly joke."
"It's the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate and we should switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep's Derrub," after.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there are six o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our clock, that is, Monday with their clock.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program was changed there were many messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to make the show with 5 matches in the sixth place - as we usually do - we tried to give more to the fans and maybe we've exceeded the target.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Inferior’ About His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to nine-year-old school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's first radio show Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The long-term program's permanent presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because she is ill.
Appearing as an outcast in Laverne's first show, Daley said as he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, were the real elements that gave me the impetus and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they heard about his sexual orientation.
Two-time Olympic bronze medal winner, he is already a high-profile LGBT activist and has used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out open because he felt fortunate that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said falling in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "took me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you experience so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same setbacks.
The couple became parents in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I was thinking was ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't admit he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if we had tickets ready for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say 'you won't be able to be a dad first,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand while he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and changed his life did I admit that for the first time and he wasn't unstoppable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the local public at the Olympics, there was no feeling more beautiful," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause moronicness.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was left on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to change his form to not turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time to participate in this event, a record in itself, which is organized every two years, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk, during the doubles (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the five-time winner of major titles, spent the day supporting the team and working in the hopes of leaving behind the worries.
Not among the right-scoring players even when he was at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the intricate Le Golf National field, where the long and difficult fields do not leave room for the wrong shots.
And if only the fear of the field was not enough, Mickelson on Sunday in the ninth match will face the champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth games this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12 singles matches, start vigorously, Mickelson's game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, although he can't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a shoulder punch, put his hand on my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and during this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it turned out that way and so we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most appearances in Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's gaspy, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to harass people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he said.
"Also, I think the younger players were having fun confronting him this week, and it was nice to see.
It's more than just a game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leader can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that the considerable lead they have before the last day of the singles games in the Ryder Cup, can be turned into an unpleasant factor.
Danezi made his debut in the 1997 confrontation at Valderrama, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans closed the tournament by winning by a very narrow difference, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"Remember to yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after seeing the 5-3 victory in 'Class 2018' Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in 'Le National' Golf.
So history tells me and everyone in that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we're going on the last march.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's finished until we get the points on the table.
"We have a goal, we try to win this trophy and that's our focus.
I've been saying it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we have to face - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the returns of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this stage.
Tomorrow we will face another “monster.”
We're going to have a performance tomorrow, and that's something else to do.
It's fantastic when you're on the field with a partner, when things are going well, but when you're alone, then you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he has to go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both major returns in the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing in what is considered the "Miracle in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day of captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take a run on one side, put a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
"We've set up the formation based on this and we're going to put the guys in the ranking that we believe is the best, because you understand, we're trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas will face Rory McIlroy in the lead, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face European players who are in the first half of the ranking.
"I chose this group and in this ranking I believe it covers the entire route in the match," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
The production of the new German warship is postponed again.
The new German navy frigate was due to be dispatched in 2014 to replace Cold War-era combat, but will not be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and rather high costs, local media reported.
The shipment of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main frigate ship of the new 'Baden-Wuerttemberg-class', has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-shipment problems damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ‘Baden-Wuerttemberg-class’ ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will serve as replacements for the old ‘Bremen-class’ frigates.
It will contain a powerful balloon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and anti-stealth technology, such as radar detection reduction, red infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be able to move for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the fights of the latest technology – which is said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad – will be outdated in the time that they enter service, writes Die Zeit.
The 'unfortunate' frigate F125, first appeared last year, when the German navy officially rejected the order for the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to its builder after delivery.
They were given little information about the reasons for the return, but media in Germany cited a series of "major software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
Programming problems were particularly important on the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships because they would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - as much as half the workforce of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship was extremely overweight, which reduced its yield and limited the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also turning into a problem.
It is said to have reached a figure that leaves it speechless at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally predicted.
The problems that have seized the new frigates become particularly important after recent warnings that the German navy's strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "finishing ships suitable for relocation."
The official said the problem had increased over time because the old ships had been removed from use but had not been replaced by new ones.
He said with regret that none of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg-class would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of the night naked.
A new research being conducted by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland aims to uncover how night owls use the ground to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will help in future protective activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common night naked ones and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown-length earrings and the Daubenton naked ones at Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special registration devices will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of the night naked throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using handheld detectors.
An analysis of the sounds that will be performed by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of the night naked sounds and what each species does.
Then, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the findings will reveal which habitats are most important to night owls and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the benefits of settlement management, such as the creation of pastures and how to maintain forests for night owls and other species associated with them.
The number of night owls in Scotland and across the UK has fallen sharply over the past century.
They are under the threat of construction and development works that have an impact on nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as displaying adhesive papers or chemical components of building materials, as well as pet attacks.
In fact, the naked men of the night are not blind.
However, due to their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the saw.
They use a sophisticated technique of finding a location through sounds to accurately identify insects and obstacles during flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes night owls very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, inspect speakers, and sometimes are involved in rescue programs.
Even the organization has set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night owls in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of Scotland's ten species of night owls.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says this place is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for the naked of the night," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there’s still a lot of stuff about the night nudes that remains unknown, so the work we’re doing here and elsewhere will help us understand more of what they need to “develop.”
He stresses the importance of carrying out naked night checks before carrying out property maintenance work because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a nest could kill up to 400 naked females and young people thus exterminating the entire population of the same area.
The night naked are protected and killing, harassing and disturbing them or destroying their speech is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of the Night Naked Conservation Trust, encourages people to become part of the relief effort.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our night owls and for many of our species, we just don't know how their population is shifting."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, addressing 142 million followers, just hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports to be "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they were told today, fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these charges, which they have called "unacceptable reports of suspicion of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped her in the anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 percent" he is a "good guy" left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had had sexual intercourse but that it was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court decision because she was "terrified by revenge" and was concerned she would be "publicly embarrassed."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to reverse the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and spent this summer with the Italian Juventus giants on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of automaker status <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He said it was "worrisome" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delays at the border, in the event of a no-deal exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how the cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit it will close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-order" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and EU, for custom cars.
If, on March 29, the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there could be delays at the border that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, the company said, and consequently production would stop.
Clark said May's "Chequers" plan for future relations with the EU "is specifically built to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we definitely need to be able to continue what has been a fairly successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long run, it warned that the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and consequently lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a senior union official at the factory, said members are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs close, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out an accurate and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interference, links between Trump's support staff and Russia, and the possibility that the president may have obstructed justice.
Discussing whether or not Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, is something that has created rumours for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered placing an eavesdropper to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president's dismissal through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Unlike what was expected, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was pushed to avoid a clash with a hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexually immoral behavior, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not yet been set, it could be this week. I think it could be delayed another week given everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But, let's see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists may object to the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question of why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a result of the dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists," although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention."
Then, she made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting data: "We've seen these figures."
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions, or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have shown the reason for this this week in New York, where he made a controversial and in some odd cases, in front of journalists.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about fears about Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter, less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations on the UK's departure from the EU have continued, approaching a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that grow and improve the work of the health service, increasing the benefits of patients and the communities we serve.
"Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an immediate surgical intervention after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 loss against the Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennessean journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the first half.
"He came to the sideline and crashed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting it in the barrel and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed the surgical intervention at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He performed five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interventions during the season to 18.
Buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher pull tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher pullee tax on the purchase of a property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative Party (Tory) plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters.
The bill will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that buyers with foreign nationality will pay higher pull taxes for the purchase of a property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and to "target" high-income people.
The bill will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the additional money will support the government's initiative to combat housing shortages.
This additional fee - which is added to the current pile tax, including the tax rate increase introduced two years ago for second homes and for properties purchased to be leased - could go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Around 13 percent of the recently built properties in London are bought by people residing outside the UK, causing prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to find shelter.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capitals - have turned into "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a pile tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping high prices by buying land but without putting it into use, and appealed to Ms. May to waive quotas for affordable homes in order to settle "Britain's disgrace with the properties."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including controlling rents and removing "for no reason" departures.
Also, he wants to give more power to the advice to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate my term of office to the return of the British dream - that is, to a better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing the problem of the home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign companies have it easier to buy homes than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too difficult to achieve and the injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
The Scotsman, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came to the Light Stadium this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I've been to representative B once and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"But as a child I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden many times with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running the clubs."
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he's not worried that he's following in the footsteps of these big names at such a big club, having previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on whether I can return this team to the Premier League.
Given the structure and ambience of this club, it certainly has its place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I would only see myself as successful if I could get the club back to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years to start his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts executive staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a category up to the third round of the cup, as well as transforming St Mirren from a near-declining club from the category to next season's Championship title winners.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, about getting Alloa's guidance.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I was playing well, doing a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Again, I'm under a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so myself all my life as an adult."

According to one study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has boosted the incomes of bars in a difficult situation in Britain, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in groups of bars and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but purchases at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who compiled the data, said: "The continued sunny weather as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected influenced July to follow the same trend as in June, where the highest sales of restaurants rose by 2.8 percent.
The shooting at restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened further in July.
Bars and venues with the main beverage supply activity recorded the best performance, with higher increases than the reduction in the retail trade in restaurants.
Locals with the main food supply activity also saw a decline as a result of sunny weather, though not as significant as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
"Sales of drinks in bars and locals rose 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we've seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the homeless market, the weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
It's no wonder that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent a year will have a particularly heavy burden given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer couldn't come at a more difficult time for food operators, and time will tell if the average temperatures in August will give the much-desired calm."
Total sales growth in local and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Industry Sales Tracking Index, for the UK bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have hidden accounts on social media that are hidden from their parents.
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 years old - have hidden social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old pupils showed an increase in "fake Insta" profiles.
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account that they tell their parents
One in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 years old - are opening social media accounts, which are being used secretly by adults.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed a rapid rise in "fake Insta" profiles - linked to the photo sharing site, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they use a clean "main" account that they tell their parents, but they also have a private account.
A mother, who accidentally uncovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, discovered that a teenager was inciting others to "rape them."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Athletics in Scotland
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Athletics in Scotland, as the non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete, and Mayor Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for all sports executives to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously by making it part of the board," Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: "I am excited to serve as the voice of athletes and I very much hope that I will contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Games with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary ischemic strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It took a tiring job but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
"Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A company for the production of breast pumps has shared public opinion with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow's milk.
To launch the promotion of what is considered the world's "first noisy and wearable breast pump," the consumer technology product society, Elvie, released a music video to promote the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four true mothers dance in a barn filled with grass under the sounds of a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I care for myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts, it's my chest."
The refrain goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the bushes, pump, pump, milk the ladies."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many of them saying it underestimates the dairy industry's "terrors."
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
"Like us, they have to stay 'satisfied' and 'birth' to produce milk, only their 'babies' are taken from them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is placed inside the receptacles and does not fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Certainly traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can carry their babies?"
Someone else added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others supported the ad, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "too funny."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if you were still breastfeeding the baby.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I've seen what it means.
"This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas advertisement aimed at mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and who feel like "wolves."
This is not an advertisement that values or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have all jumped with the "secret" pump placed on the recipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is noiseless, has no threads or tubes, is placed inside the receptacles and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while using it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Creative Executive Director) at Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
Making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the use of the breast pump and the challenges it faces, also displaying in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the cloud pump gives.
This isn't the first time Ellie's pump has come out on the front page.
During a fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the sidewalk of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children banned has risen even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policies presented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Typically, most supporters have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to risk their stay in the country by trying to apply to take a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults from the same family would have to give their fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the people arrested had no previous criminal record.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters remain in the country illegally and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal records.
So, we're continuing to pursue these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to shelter workers, trying to process children's data faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the ban, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through videoconferencing and not physically, to argue their claim to legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children are left out, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee.
Proponents say these concerns are more apparent in larger environments such as Tornillo, where, due to their size, they are more likely to bypass the signs that a child is having trouble.
They add that relocating children to your city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause traumas that many of them already face.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are staying on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will "act with them in the right way."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue, which should be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the three-million-strong province.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had "clear guidelines" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be "exterminated."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to the revision of the provisions of the current constitution," and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope, accusations and scandals put an end to his presidency ahead of time.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during peak hours, out of 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's program, The Rachel Maddow Show, has reached the top of the cable channel rankings with 3.5 million viewers during major event evenings.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama series on ABC's "Designated Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He replied, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said to me.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, if you find yourself six hours later watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "pampered information" in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's ostrich-leather bomber jacket, worth $15,000 ("a garment filled with arrogance," Trump said.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does and makes it look like a 'reality show' is that it feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the actors who circulate and the unexpected daily developments.
You can't leave an episode unanswered or you're left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging at the helm.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs in the past and people saying, 'This is the last beginning of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector floods into tight competition for congressional elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th zone is facing a cash influx as a result of the reorganisation of the electoral zones that forces two incumbent officials to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganization in Pittsburgh's peripheral areas has set up Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in special elections, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th zone, overlaid with the new 17th zone.
This new division of the maps came after the decision of the Pennsylvania High Court, which, in January, expressed that the old areas had been unconstitutionally and unfairly designated in favor of Republicans.
This race, in the new zone 17, has also spurred a strong confrontation in campaign funding by the main funding bodies of the parties, the Democratic Committee for Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Electoral Area.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points difference.
The Democrats are seen by the Democrats as their favorites.
The U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to remove U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were reviewed only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the U.S. in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and certain restrictions on visa issuance, would be severe for the Central American country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America pushed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow up on a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving forward.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to take place, ending every opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to deliver a speech at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a signal that shows the administration's importance to this meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys, quietly returned from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided their anonymity was maintained.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right to anonymity.
Study the history.
The next event expected to happen could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction by Mr Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
Mueller is reportedly shifting his investigation to confirm whether during his campaign, Trump has cooperated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its wing, Mr. Trump will have to account before this body, at a time when he is preparing to stand again before the voters, and perhaps eventually face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump - or that of his counterparts in Europe - is inevitable.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the unstoppable journey of democracy.
Currently, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fates of the investigation into Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein hasn't been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported last year that he had suggested hiding the president, as well as speculating that he wasn't fit to stay in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite grounded allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the next election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the residence of the ambassadors where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the symbol of the swastika (broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a former member of the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's tumultuous century in five lives and in a legendary home."
Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna.
On Thursday, the Rangers expect Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify for Group G, the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a boost to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We got into the field believing we could get something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored at the end but, overall, I think the equalization was a fair result.
"Maybe they were better in the first half while we showed up in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it's going to be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their past match, but with the fans who support us, I'm sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries suffered and changes in the club but now there is an optimism factor in this team.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying it a lot; the training is going well.
"I hope we can move forward, throw last season behind the wings and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to take care of them, very few people spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Society, Nationwide.
Here's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes first.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Also get your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life-saving insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance through your property - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care attorney and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that the experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting a procurement for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee the payment of invoices if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and the medications you are taking?
Write down a plan with these details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial aspect that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"Which medications will be used?"
Who will take care of the dog?
"Make this plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said as the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications networks out of service, assistance workers have failed to receive information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu, which was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by a tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed the lives of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of which are in the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have lost their lives on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude quake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that crashed on the south coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after recalling the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report submitted Saturday by Alaska State Police, Paul, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he picked up the phone.
Paul is being held in the Mat-Su detention facility and is being secured in the form of $500 unsecured bonds, KTUU reported.
According to reports from this network, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about the acknowledgment of guilt, he declared himself "absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three Category A violations, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Category B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting and drunkenness during the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed on Friday as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck the central part of Sulawesi, located in the northeastern part of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that hasn't been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a bicycle road along the western highway in lower Manhattan, trampling pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and caused serious bodily injury "intentionally", according to the letter aimed at seeking the death penalty, filed in the Southern District.
According to a court document, both of these charges could be punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of homicide in aid of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed the crime as "disgusting, cruel and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the letter read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York criminally prosecuted a case with the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbek nationality, did not show repentance in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not to admit guilt accompanied by life imprisonment without possibility of appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservative Conference, that he would "mobilize the army of the people."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" if Brexit's secretary was Mr Farage.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to join her group has been highlighted by pro-EU stay-at-home conservatives, who joined you in another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is finding it difficult to implement the compromise plan reached in Chequers, amid the attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
Allies insist that she will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite harsh reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and chaos.
During the March of Departure, Mr. Bone declared that he wanted to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be put in charge and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were at the top, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
"We want to make our laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not supported even within our party and by the activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
"Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep the job in cases when they keep the promises.'
Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are considering abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of faith between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell him that we're not going to let you do something like that."
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is close to leaving Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-governed."
Meanwhile, they marched pro-stay in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small group of activists held banners writing Conservatives against Brexit after the group showed up on the weekend.
Labour supporter Lord Adonis ironized with the Conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social app" at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the IT systems and technology needed for Canada plus plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's totally a farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "consider carefully" the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "consider carefully the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future during a joint meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a persistent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-directed Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting held Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters according to the municipal format, since the time Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for "women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top."
A man has been arrested for the murder of LSU team player Wayde Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at around 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge police department said at a news conference.
Police released a video of the shootings on Friday, seeking help to identify the person who appeared on the scene.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims passed away as a result of gunshot wounds to the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, carrying a gun, and that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to the police department in the eastern Baton Rouge area.
The Sims, 6'6'' tall, played 32 games, of which 10 as a titular last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's instructions give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
"Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas started from first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton race in "traffic" at the end of the car pile, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes made the stop a lap later and positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out on top after several maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave space from within after a double move to defend in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round of the seventh rank, on his 21st birthday.
Then he was at the top in a large part of the race after not changing tires to reach a quick finish and overtaking Kimi Raikkonen by ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop in the 44th round but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight rounds by dropping fourth place to Raikkonen.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and showed a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these position exchanges," Hamilton said.
Very poor use of body language.
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein during a rally on Saturday, citing her insistence that she was not the person who "published" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer you to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "lawful, evil, and unfaithful."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you look at people who are angry, evil, bad, and insincere," he said.
"When you look at the publications I've secretly made and then the people who say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who brought the letter to the public?
Do you remember her answer... did you get the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, yes.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
"We didn't get it out, we didn't get it out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh and the document came out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the information had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't expose her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as she asked me to."
But apparently her denial was unacceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, the gestures really left to be desired.
"Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen anything worse."
Defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats are using alleged accusations to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to take power and control," Mediaite reported as words from the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars offset Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League challenge, winning the return match with a score of 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly went on to double advantage thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, to Adam Keefe's loyalists, who on Friday evening returned from the draw to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams this season, with the first three won by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaull assistant, while David Rutherford gave the assistant to Beauvillier, who doubled the score four minutes later.
During an intensive first part, Sullivan returned the locals to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted for Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the break by scoring his second goal of the evening, at the end of the first half.
The locals were regrouped and Bouchard returned the draw with a strong hit at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to assist Nielsen, who gave Dundee the lead for the first time in this challenge, at the end of the second half and secured the victory to his team with the fifth goal, scored in the final part.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games on Friday, will play their next home game against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller loses his life by making sure hundreds of people on a plane escape the quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being honored as a hero after losing his life by making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have been declared lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area and many people have been trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the swinging control tower at Palusa's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stood to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought she was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"This news has broken our souls," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the local disaster mitigation agency says entry to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is expected that this number will continue to increase, as there were still many troops under the rubble, while others were not found," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palunya, where a mass mortuary ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military aircraft and merchants are bringing supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings corpses.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to perform any task related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Says One Person Was Lost After Airplane Collided in Lagoon
The airline that operated a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now declared a missing person, after declaring that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane in the water.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they were not finding a passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to locate the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the consequences of the events remain unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the waist level, he and other people managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, while he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to repair a scaffold nearby helped rescue them, using an airboat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have lost their lives in collisions of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of them.
Analyst builds the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its arguments to the prosecution of a person accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours, in the quality of an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she had received location data from several cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers after her death, a fact that dismisses his previous claims.
When records revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter said that "he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is Tellis's statement, which said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defendant is expected to give the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said the jury will decide on the same day.

"Another man of color?"
A New York babysitter sues the couple for quitting work after receiving a "racist" message
A New York babysitter has sued a couple for discrimination on leaving work after receiving an error message from a mother who complained that she was "another black man."
The couple denied they were racists, calling the lawsuit "a robbery."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of the two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the young nanny Giselle Maurice, was a black woman, at the time she appeared on her first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her flaw, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeling annoyed," fired Ms. Maurice, on the grounds that their current nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a "cap in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation worth $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has denied claims of being racist, saying Maurice's departure was the right move, fearing they could no longer believe them after they insulted him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you've been rude to, even if wrongly?"
"Your newborn child?
Tell me."
Considering the lawsuit as a "snare," Plasco said he and his wife had given birth to a child two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you take revenge on someone in this situation?"
It's not something positive to do," added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers wouldn't make connections with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
"We are delighted to see Paddington's extraordinary success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, would be saddened if his work was refused, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, the following year, was "successful."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and didn't brag," she said.
"Paddington was so true that it was the same as having a child who succeeds: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's character himself."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye to her by phone.
After arriving, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but failed.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was too heavy, that he didn't believe he would make it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing its effect and slowly getting out of her system.
She had died a long time ago, and now everything was "going down".
I was forced to sit and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
Over time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers - who were not aware of what she was experiencing.
"Nobody knew," she said.
I kept my head down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a lot of regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages on a bridge in Wales as well as the phone numbers of people who can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sticky" smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always say that his smile illuminates every room.
However, he quit his job before changing his life, as he was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "to let people know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even to a friend.
"Don't sit alone, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt annoyed, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye and didn't take any action."
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but that they must overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been destroyed.
"We all have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance after FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could give him something similar to what he was looking for - a time-limited investigation and on the subject - maybe we could bring some harmony," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "dissolved" amidst numerous obstacles from opponents.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation comes as a result of time.
The congressional election is just five weeks away, on November 6th - if Republicans go bad, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to elect the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Mr Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end the situation and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is falling under Kim's leadership.
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Union in South Korea, has stated that there have been about 1,127 desertions last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penny didn't make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters get their nationality from South Korea.
Seoul has said more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them leave for China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea and can be crossed there more easily compared to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is defended by multiple forces.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
The meeting came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first," he said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and expressed that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman were ever brought in like this, people would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very anxious and at some point almost yelled or "gets his mouth out" when talking about his family and his high school years.
He accused the Democrats in front of the committee, calling the accusations against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of his figure", organized by liberals angry at the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her view that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, after she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question of whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of no confidence in the event of his appointment, and if the Democrats win the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's ineligible not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In hearings for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and one-sided person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say 'oh, how good!'" Pelosi said.
And women have to take advantage of it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of anger that explodes, and it fails to lead to the end without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What about you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who worked in a leadership position, who expressed that she too cried when she was angry, but had devised a style that whenever she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the interlocutors, 'You can think I'm bored next to her.
But I'm really angry."
And then she continued to talk.
And I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men dominated and where at one point I found myself crying out of uncontrollable anger, was the moment when an older woman grabbed me by the throat - a cold manager - that I was afraid of.
“Never let others see you crying,” she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they're going to be happy to get bored."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital affair on board a boat called "Monkey Business" and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, extremely angry, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"This was not a well-weighted decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Somebody called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was in its final stages, it had lagged behind with fundraising, so it vowed it would not compete if it failed to raise $2 million.
But it was a futile war.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Don't you think I'm going to get a seat?" she asked herself.
During the speech where he announced that he would not conduct an official campaign, it was so overwhelmed with emotions – gratitude for the people who supported him, anger with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and mark voters instead of delegates – and anger with sex.
"It seemed like I had suffered a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the way the press reacted to her.
"It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking, what would people write on my gravestone?
"She's crying"?
The U.S.-China Trade War's Advantages for China
The first waves of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war is far from over, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, when new tariffs hit $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time "in kind", most recently by imposing tariffs from five to ten percent on more than $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to return the same currency to the U.S., and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to surrender soon.
Withdrawal from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to publicly humiliate himself before the United States.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards properly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long run, to reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken swiftly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the U.S.-based research center on security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, where you had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Around six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the country will not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National, out of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six games in a row on European territory and has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team managed to score 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced the most difficulty during the tournament, took the first shot in the water and closed the 16th pit with 3 shots more than the set level, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 out of 4 players who have scored 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stand it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
"I'm very, very happy that we've won the Cup.
The success is the team's, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said after the European team's victory.
He spoke to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated 2&1 American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in a live challenge.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that I defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 statistic, during his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team faced difficulties throughout the weekend to take the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing appearance, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were a few moments during this parade when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congrats to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12-year-olds played very well.
"We will regroup, work with PGA in America as well as our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We've got to take the hat off.
They played better than us."
