28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, "Finally he went back upstairs."
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensic department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and investigations are underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had made his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Son & Daughter said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who was swimming with the stream.
“In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was that rough diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD’s reference phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labeled from outside, which usually has little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t always want to be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, I find these things rather cumbersome."
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at the fact that she is considered a "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of television with a loose blanket and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
To the white glow, she brings the question of the child desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of variation with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their festive evening, they chased home to the fodder pigs in a quick gallop.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV, and on a horse he did not even swing for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has nodded to him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” Langer says, “because it is given not only for sporting achievements, but also for social engagement.”
For decades, Langer has been promoting youth.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
The awards include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöder and the jumper Alwin Schockemöder.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer distanced himself from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a principled issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it rather small in doubt and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
It would be completely different, Trump said.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has opportunities to open up to the disadvantaged, and it needs money to do so.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close in terms of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The Democratic candidate is announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the state-critical Tea Party wing of the Republicans.
Trump could be the subject of internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil extraction is also possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands: “A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs.”
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America – I want us to be.”
But not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
The TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to isolate itself from international trade – it simply wants to better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, Clinton said.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says that the minimum wage must go up, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to evolve around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics are holding him back, only to make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them held her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the division manager of Condrobs, a social welfare agency in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
Recently, it was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” says Bahr.
“Men flee wars because they are being persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls,” she said.
For women, other reasons for fleeing are prevalent: “Many steal secretly because they don’t see another way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced labour, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the run, this continues.
“For example, for a bottle of water to demand a sexual act is not a rarity,” says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany are insane, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodations would often be considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often don’t know how to help themselves, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answered with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabians alone, refugee women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Middle Franconia, some community accommodations have floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says, "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be - continuous - violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, according to the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen in the urge that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since it has been said that we exist, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors on strike: demands for new labour struggle measures
Deputy doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new labour-related measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labor-fighting measures as of early September.
The JDC said ministers failed to respond to concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently calm” about problems, leading to the treaty being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has agreed to reject the proposed new contract altogether and has requested official renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor struggle measures beginning in early September.
The disputes resulted in assistant physicians striking six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the sessions that were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory.
Russia and Turkey: An “Alliance of Foreigners”?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-minded and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to one report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a radiant, sustainable cooling by Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin shared, accusing Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will become difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious accusations by senior officials were that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently disputed this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
Eventually, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia could have scored a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost stripped of his office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They are counting on a late-season assault on the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists long there, tomatoes long here."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it sees its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing resentment about the slow pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is, of course, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this shiny palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent one, as one analyst once described to me, “an alliance of outsiders”: two countries that have turned away from the West and feel badly treated and now ally themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator for Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He bet on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, a milestone on his local racetrack with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry, and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I’m very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the cheers when he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the obstacle course milestone - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has fascinated fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he hadn’t been just a weekend and tournament hockey player!
Frankie has ridden winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-racking.
A number of major tournament wins, including his famous 1996 "Glorious Seven" in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his hesitants and return to his best form.
And he's not over yet - Dettori has said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had ordered “the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration” without giving any reasons.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website it says (in Russian) that he later served as head of protocol and head of staff of government personnel.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it’s the government’s most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that right now.
But the official claim – that a man who was once promoted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy – came across with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – you could almost say – difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he most trusted.
It was once believed that after Putin’s second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which are producing the series, announced its resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details on how the character of Gibson will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the series' first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put all of my heart’s blood in it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The scheduled broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28.
Puzzle about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A Banff resident called for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spied on by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering of a truly epic proportion in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.
In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck will receive a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents the future-oriented construction of high and low-rise buildings.
After the installation of the last section of the roof and its connection with the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances that the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men found it difficult to swim safely as their boat moved on on its own.
"We saw the boat around her and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, head of Moelfre's rescue station.
Fortunately, the strong winds had already swept the boat out of range until we left it in the water,” he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging from a boat without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are fortunate to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop, it was disconnected from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was cornered.
Someone's been watching these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic offender tore the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he came into the house, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
She then alarmed her sister.
Together with her life partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her life partner.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken into account much more strongly in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 affordable apartments in the coming years?
The SPD proposes a "living action concept" for the next Council meeting.
Controversy is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the affordable apartments?
So far, there is no regulation.
Christoph Bratmann, chairman of the SPD group, said: “We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, you will have to declare 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future.”
However, the affordable apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the big issue in the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent, of homes as social dwellings on such areas.”
A new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still have to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the factions."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left wants tougher conditions for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, there is an exacerbation of the situation in the housing market.
If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: because of the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how to compensate for the loss of another 1300 affordable apartments, the promotion of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expired bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about bringing homes back into the price tag.
This is possible in the West.
The problem could be solved in one blow.
In the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price range for cheap apartments.
That’s not what the owners want, the housing companies don’t.
After all, the number of social housing in the western city is once again drastically increased, one moves away from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There is no longer a concentration of socially weak people in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to get on the boat."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go: A Hunt for Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I’m referring to the Pokémon Go Wahh, an app based on the characters that were originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of cartoons, game cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest declined slightly before the game was released in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “captured”.
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped to search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game resulted in a significant increase in steps taken by the "average" person every day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked who exercised for 30 minutes each day increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health outreach campaigns that want people to “take 30 minutes off the couch,” “come from the couch,” and “be active every day” hit deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Regularly exercising reduces your chances of developing cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to cite here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them enjoy themselves.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also gruesome game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up, man?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they didn’t give us any reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease with time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in women's urns
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Easily on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole.
And now, finally, an Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the multi-fight title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the hover beam during the women's singles multi-fight final in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, while consolidating her reputation of being the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that involve a mixture of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I have ever seen.”
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn’t go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's singles multi-fight final in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday as she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell celebration of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not really true.
Part of their floor exercises — which include their typical tumbling pass — are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted as a small child by her grandparents and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym in which Boorman was trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Although Mustafina led lightly through two turns, the picture was misleading.
Floating beams and ground turns - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - were heard.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the hoverbar – and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her as she waited for her final result – a pure formality – and tears poured over Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman’s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called by the Americans "Grandma", had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 killed in serial murder while listening to music in car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial killing while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, according to the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of a house,” Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in that.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've got to admit it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing it.
“My first response to that was ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund couldn’t sit or crawl until he was three years old and he still couldn’t speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows Edmund's sign language for "Please sing me something."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don’t expect it to be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods lead to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the Tangipahoa municipality alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is deployed across much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service said that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, an early flood warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the stepped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams are still flooding people in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another son-in-law, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such an elevation of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency responders had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the ground has been heavily polluted by the rain since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooding on the roads caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failures in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, which were now both flooded.
Municipality chief Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been washed away by the floods.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to flooding and sandbags were provided for residents to take with them, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," Lacy Landrum of the city administration said.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but so far no one has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6 'Ballholed', Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say the six-year-old was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a six-year-old has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the broadcaster.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that apparently there was a crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles, traced back to various assault rifles, overwhelmed the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle in this regard.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here," police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the station in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and the police are currently investigating the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar on her arm as she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine for the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics, and for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, rounding up Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one among female gymnasts has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and cheered America.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the peak of this sport, but this is not how gym classes all over the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to enable the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a more efficient and easily accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for capturing so many young girls from different backgrounds motivated to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant Doctors Want to Organize More Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s Proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a “no-man’s-land” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Assisting physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current employment crisis and that it will fail to treat all doctors.”
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government’s reluctance to participate and sometimes with deafening silence.
This was the result of a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the enforcement and address the concerns of the assistant doctors".
Should he not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labor-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide doctors with coverage on the strike mail chain.
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Combat measures achieve nothing but little, but burden already overloaded teams and service providers and only prepare patients, caregivers and their families for worries, distress and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries’ concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement of the BMA in other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and the work with gender-specific pay gaps in health - would be significant.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-per-day medication after being recommended by authorities to administer this to more people for an extended period of time.
The coagulation inhibitor ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’s NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing material in the artery walls that form the linings.
If the lining breaks down, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE guidance draft published today recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
The fear of a recurrent heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience has shown that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - in particular the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft instructions do not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Makes Voting Fraud Blossom in Muslim Areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacked the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lock tapes outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He spoke particularly alarmingly about the fraudulent letter-election - in which senior members of the Muslim community had pressured people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including driving IDs to prove identity
The report states: “Evidence has been put in place that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that ... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing ballot papers to stop “voters.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have cast their voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibit political activists from editing complete election letters and envelopes of election letters.
Give the police the power to set up lockdowns on polling stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in polling stations (except for Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy inappropriate for litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds for sufficiently - in accordance with the high demands in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning sign.
As the mother of parliaments, our country bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kates Radler doubles and other famous Olympic athletes doubles in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week have been struck by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn’t the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous double this summer — at least not if you’re allowed to believe in social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison, a team member of the U.S. archery team, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the racetrack, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused an attack on Twitter after pictures of him appearing eeriely similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London in 2012 will undoubtedly be even more focused this year: the striking similarity between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to pass as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been certified by fans to be a “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Strong Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only ones: One Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the gym Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer “died like a pig”
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming staff outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “was going off like a miff” and during the race like “a pig died.”
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost her connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you. Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swimming stage 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"???
The idiot didn’t realize they were still on the air.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost her connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many speaking out against him.
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen wording, we’re sorry it happened.”
CBC eventually apologized over 90 times to people who responded to the remarks via Twitter
Commenter Scott Russell Apologised on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on broadcast and to our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming staff on the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no intentional disregard and I am very sorry.”
Buyer in Primark indignant about woman trying shameless underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
To aggravate the situation, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out, and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, England.
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, pulled out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oscar."
"Everyone stared when she took off her underpants again, which she obviously didn't like as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, dressed up and left.
“She didn’t seem to bother observing anyone — or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that was worn by another person and was not washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I noticed, the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulling them out again and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9, at our branch in Folkstone.”
All products in question have been removed from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spit for your thief.
When approaching you from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the bar and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends down in pain. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it forms Mizrachi.
But keep in mind that in the event of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright draws his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and choking reflex — by uncovering some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, dug his moves on a Euro ticket, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a wash-up button of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before blackening each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the rinse button of a traction toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to toilet flushing buttons, the task definitely put his immune system under test.
“Already as a child, I was relatively unpreoccupied with my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the movie, he deserved his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample stroke showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after its luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one in less than 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "That's close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve recorded some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed were associated, in particular, with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Before Dislodging Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An unsocial family left their social dwelling after a delogation with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed creaking holes, wooden slats were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was greased onto the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don’t have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is as well.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball batsmen, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels, and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the timber dealers were torn down
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing dislodged her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The logging was hailed by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a logging is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be awful to watch for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and community members who bravely approached us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging
Homeworkers will now have to clear the garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as weighings, paraphernalia and cash worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were plastered with graffiti.
Police say they will dislodge tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall said the logging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes for those who think they can behave without self-accusations as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in panic after a deep-floating military jet flies over beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force put an incredible crash flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-floating jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within reach over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was happening to them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It really flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists at Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that it was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that safety was not compromised at any time.
This summer, surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restricted his vision.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca worried about Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans will face off against FC Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup duel outside, with the rematch three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner will have to give up Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic Football Tournament, in the power show with the inferior cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion among others.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ribbon soak in his knee during training, which at least for the time being clarified the question at Barca in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years for the status of number one.
So far, coach Luis Enrique has renounced a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but for that Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated 0:4 in a test match of Liverpool on Saturday.
Even in the 3:2 rehearsal race against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. still did not really convince.
Sevilla, in turn, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after prolongation in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de España".
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with 11 hits so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the World Rankings-First took the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympia.
The bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese managed to make it to the final as expected and scored the title against each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the singles title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese to climb the top Olympic ladder was former SVS-NRO legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the tribune and let their protectors go on their own in fair competition.
"I've played the matches so far for my country."
"In the final, I play for myself," Zhang had consequently said.
After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected compelling match did not evolve.
Nevertheless, there were still enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarterfinals against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become fourth in the similarly high table tennis age Olympia.
Donald Trump admits to 'violent problems' in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries of losing their majority, even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually high-profile and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Fake reports about his candidacy are to blame, he picked up his well-known media bulletin.
Shaking Republican Fortresses
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just like I’ve done so far.”
And pushed back: "This will either be successful, or I'm going to have a very, very nice, long vacation."
He doesn’t do anything but “tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party has threatened to wipe out funds in support of his election campaign if he could not present better poll values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress should be held in their arms.
Olympia: Three-way fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's lightweight athlete threatens to be unhappy after the second doping deal at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
After an attempted doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and today’s coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic Village.
This has been reported to Kenya’s team management by the doping controllers.
The IAAF World Federation has asked the IOC for information on the case to further its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.
“Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will conduct an assessment,” the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He owned the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth in the Beijing World Cup over 800 metres in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is reported to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the more than 2,000 doping target checks imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it has been unusually pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping practices comply with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country’s light athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, there have been repeated allegations that doping funds are readily available in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
In doing so, it was possible to prove that in this sport it was extensively and systematically doped.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
This is a surprise for Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, led by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, says: "This music is full of rhythm."
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.
It’s a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers with tears her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her.
She's a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
For him, directing is a necessity.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it’s his life!
It’s such a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn’t want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were back then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Has Been Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good thing is — as a reminder and a warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone — to keep people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane heading for Turkey and then boarded a bus on the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and within a few months became a widow.
Reid Says Clinton Will Remain Candidate for Supreme Court in Case of Election Win at Garland
Harry Reid, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland “with some certainty.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, saying they were laypeople and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidency.
Treats wants naked calendar for "Women and for men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats editor Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because “playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar does too.
“We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
“Whoever doesn’t adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases,” says Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Gülen-near Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Due to the hard work of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak, the association's chairman of the "World" on Friday.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with crimes months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that accepts refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevite cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
A “witch hunt” against Erdogan’s critics is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition parties.
The brand marking as a Gülen pendant destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Dialogue and Education Foundation, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of June 30, this number was 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all eligible asylum seekers (39,625).
In this survey, there are no fugitives from war, poverty or hopelessness.
Asylum seekers under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote in the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the national parliamentary elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not as silly as it has been: summer holidays, heat and national day election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, travelling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and finally count voices are just trying to push up.
Until September 4, 2016, the last day of elections and holidays, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to let electoral campaign pass the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be exciting how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what is left in the end suitable for the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is conducting an almost inconspicuous election campaign.
He travels around the country, distributing roses and chatting with people, just as his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering got cold feet and blamed Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s flourishing.
Their refugee policy, their “We can do this” has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably now cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU and its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, have already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburgers and Pre-Pomeranians.
"There was probably the majority from other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, CDU general secretary in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the DDR.
But it doesn’t hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to even listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, Kokert says, only plays a “subordinate role.”
The Union has also noticed that it is breaking the ground in the country, that it has to make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-deprecating: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village feasts, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with 7% in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state legislature.
They make the holiday note a modern virtue and largely put their election campaign on the Internet.
"Online election campaign," state president Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green voters go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Their impression: "election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 sanitation: restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything quite puzzling," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet-tank station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October.
The meeting of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to the establishment of access points, is also praised.
Since the construction site migrated south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the site has relaxed.
Citizens can now drive from Frefterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The evasion traffic through the place seems to be going backwards.
“There were some significant complaints,” says Florian King, deputy chief executive officer responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many people were looking for slipways and were more familiar with their navigation rather than the signage.
As a result, some trucks became frantic in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not complied with, the municipality reinforced the demand for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant crossings," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was travelling at 77 km/h in the 30-speed zone.
Since the construction site moved on, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue breaches in them, let everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", that is, produce for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Also at Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running knowledge is lacking".
The most crowded are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existentially threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
Revenue declines are “well over 50 percent.”
The road renovation has thrown back its operation "by two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner on whether there could be a financial compensation, noting that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now come by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't go, it's nice elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubt that his Stammkunde will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his customer base to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly screwed up.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the German interior minister said in the presentation of his new security package.
You're not overindulging anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed first within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As interior minister, however, he was keen on results and on an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has left some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Something is already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Neither is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities also comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second round of proposals that were not to be made with the SPD until now: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and knock off the German passport for jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chances anyway.
A few new ideas de Maizière also presents.
They have it partly in themselves: He is planning expeditious procedures for deportations and more ways to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are being brought into the country are expected to have their smartphones checked beforehand and to disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before – such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally delicate.
Some of them seem to be unresolved and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety given the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply involved in, weren’t allowed to get out of the way even during election campaigns.
Internal security has become a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioned on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, things have gone up between the two parties.
First a bitter controversy over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security-political collection of ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for reconciling tones here.
He thinks nothing of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them doesn't make sense.
And with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in every corner and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be revealed.
There are a lot of things that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals cautiously willingness to talk, saying: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still glamorous.
Despite diesel scandals, the number of deliveries worldwide is rising.
However, it does not run around in all markets.
In the recall action there is a swirl around a term.
Volkswagen will start delivering behavior products in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest automaker can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well-functioning markets.
However, in July, the core brand of VW weakened mainly in Western Europe, again burdening overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8% fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 449,100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries decreased by almost a sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a buyback in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the UK’s vote to leave the EU has also been burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a minus.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, Lower Saxony’s mainly affected home brand continues to be flattering due to the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent drop in deliveries to 3.37 million vehicles is on the line.
Head of sales Fred Kappler was able to show a further sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this time, with 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion into the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative impact.
After refurbishment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The automaker issues the customer a "warranty-equal" certificate after the renovation, but does not speak of a "warranty", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The “Focus” had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customer a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting was held.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my Investigation Commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle approval-relevant values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not, as it was said in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, six months after the conversion, will come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also in the interests of the customer that it is important to avoid that any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal will lead to uncertainty regarding possible guarantee schemes, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding future penalty interest from wealthy savers - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday, “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in cash or daily cash accounts.”
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their grotesque penalty interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their penalty rate of 0.4 percent.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund will reimburse private and corporate customers for deposits of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 in turnover or daily cash accounts starting in September.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for quite some time, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he could not use.
“They are in my central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent,” the bank’s chief executive said.
"I can't put in every million 4,000 euros."
The costs will now be passed on according to the polluter principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't like the fifth!", said the bank's director.
Most customers would have understood and switched to other forms of investment.
Few have migrated to other banks.
The Bavaria Cooperative Association said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs for all banks.”
Wearing them alone is "not economically viable".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penal interest rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its tax bank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive deposit fees, as the competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong.”
One banker said that there is "a clientele on Lake Tegern, which is a little more generously equipped with wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if she keeps free money.
Founded in 1911, Genossenschaftsbank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
“No other banks are currently known to the Bavaria Cooperative Association to charge for deposits from private customers,” said spokesman Ernst.
Uwe Fröhlich, president of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), said at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is fierce, and it threatens the emigration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not be pleased with this.
Destination Records: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMenMiddle Age with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and gesturing wildly before I stand still, holding my hands and saying something defining like, “So, let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings that once housed independent sellers – there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill in the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and repurchase items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
That would explain the boom in fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that evoke happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
This is true of me as a collector and I think it is true of many people.
It’s an easy way to get involved mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" whispers one employee from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just recently came in here and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz sounds out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity with customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to spot when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
It's more of a shop window bump than a big purchase.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting plates isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." she drifts off with a loving sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be sampling the jeans hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley recorder.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them—perhaps because they’re purely decorative, some so far up that it’s impossible to touch them.
It's pure "disc art."
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of sohos for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that one population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as plates.
Although my research found that the results of YouGov are true, at least in record stores in Soho, they leave out the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly won’t spend Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring look of an awful, 30-year-old fake moderator who whispers over the shoulders of unprecedented middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - Video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says the record was with a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer of demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 interim stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or offer tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple euro meals for a few restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which posed a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the Calais Prefecture's concerns were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp’s non-profit Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cycling professional Tony Martin does not want to be underestimated.
"I keep my eyes on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook ahead of his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyze calmly what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time of the World Championships in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look closely at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund misses the semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's victory ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to carry out her task once and appeared powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of the Summer Games had last been in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group rises in start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday.
Beam launched its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry has already stopped.
Employees of the startup, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
For the customers, therefore, the acquisition should not change anything.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 from online retailer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google mother alphabet.
Here Comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s razors have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transmit pacemakers particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in accident centers where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile buildup can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autonomous: Its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be tracked over multiple tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-speed state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer clutch.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: Recently, France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK wins silver in 7th rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7th rugby came to an abrupt stop in the final on Thursday night at the last barrier in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji handed out a master class in handling, side stepping, downhill, line running and raw power to win gold – its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the silver medal’s not too bad consolation price – Britain’s fourth on that day – and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The boxing defeat, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in that form.
It could be a comfort to GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path to follow.
Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slug will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs bounce off of fun.
The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau slammed into the corner, making it a big hit for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he transformed.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A superb tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua ran a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through further weak tackles of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It’s as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant midfielder from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the platform.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-top with another try in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked destructively beaten into the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that means something.
From the first rudder blow to the last, 220 hard Hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were sitting on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of volunteers contributing to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would even survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don’t, it will spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment early in 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is already a challenge in itself, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked together.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would not be anyone, so a big thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to start up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to get caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio.
Shortly afterwards, the Water Forum honored the purpose association of the government of Unterfranken.
The work of the Veitenstein group was considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Rupert Göller, a 31-year-old employee at the purpose association, is behind all of this, including 28 years as Managing Director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually produces about 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities, there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, the mayor of Breitbrunn, Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterguard in 1985 and appointed as managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from plumbing and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions, to emergency operations on weekends," she said.
Outstanding events were the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountains (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new fountains (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high reservoirs (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no pause and innovations have been made over and over again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has devoted a lot of heart to his Water Purpose Association and he has lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller praised waterguard Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water guard and he was a loyal guy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he referred to the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the pipe break at the high reservoir near Kirchlauter on January 3.
It will have to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages can be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn was only maintained once, because the high reservoir of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will succeed Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago’s autism – and turns to other affected parents: “You have to have the courage to talk about it.”
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - man shoots life partner
A 35-year-old man shot and wounded his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) on Friday at around 10:45 a.m.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run and is being hunted publicly.
In the meantime, all over the country, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brunette and has a baldness.
In the meantime, the police released a photo of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a scarf.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, the police said.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
Police are calling it a “state of relationship.”
The victim was born in 1988 and the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but confirmed that a person had been killed.
“It’s a murder crime.”
"We are not saying anything at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry remains saved from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the eco-current promotion are off the table.
It remains in the exemption from the renewable energy conversion at the existing plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really glad we were finally able to achieve that after two years of tough negotiations."
Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry faced additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG coverage of 20 percent be applied.
But this is also not raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on its own electricity generation.
In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely established.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our 'Steel is the Future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"In the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets must also be weighed against," IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel show an effect, on the other, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry chief Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced nearly six percent less raw steel than in the previous year, the Stahl Economic Association said on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced has now declined for the second consecutive month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year’s value.
The Association expects an increasing output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, mind, health: singing is good for seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in teacher’s studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good for her health and her spirit.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and nurture social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also made this experience in her choir: "To reconcile and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly, even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers recall long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, Lenz explains.
Concentrating on one’s own voice and a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing yourself: When I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there are enough.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You can't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who listens when a sound goes by?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church directly or the head of the church.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with Internet research.
Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to cries of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold either - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the excitement of cat babies at the mileage of the little ones.
They respond ten percent faster to sounds of kittens that are in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Medicine Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats respond to the calls of kittens, but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the milling of less and highly excited juveniles are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten's cry differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH livestock were observed.
They were first played a call of little ones, who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated by their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their findings meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when that call of the very excited kitten played.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski strikes for Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski’s Galatasaray Istanbul for the Super Cup in Konya, the official line is clear: “Business as usual” is announced.
Already with the imposition of the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July, the government argued that normal citizens should not be affected by everyday life.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping the football either.
The Prosecutor’s Office issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group and is now living in the United States.
Sukkur is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency imposed initially for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact it has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy watches” in public squares across the country ended on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas Workers' Club are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
But what unites most of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree – whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the "Gala" Cup will be Lukas Podolski.
Cologne proved his athletic value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine appearances in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club’s top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1–0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" hailed him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season found a reconciling conclusion for the record champion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Super League, it was only enough to rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win anything.
"We did it and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season hits as Super League goalkeeper king laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return after his EM holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, all he has to do is say it," said club manager Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be willing to forego about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been jailed twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other converted athletic sinners can only laugh about it – they are fighting in Rio for medals.
The subject of doping continues to make headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had sued her right to start shortly before the games after a doping lockdown, was relentlessly pissed off at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: with a smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was decided that she would not bring gold, the audience burst into a bliss.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are going to start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m season/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was arrested twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and former World Champion has run even faster than before, over 100 m in 9.80 seconds is the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger by Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m season/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion had to face a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was proven to be taking the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic winner, 2013 World Champion and 2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the deliberate intake and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m season/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and twice world champion over 400m, was tested positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A means of enlargement of the penis was responsible, asserted Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world so far.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been awarded so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title for testosterone abuse.
He was also awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
With 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion was found to have taken a banned dietary supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA’s ban fell mildly and expired on July 13.
Bombing in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said on Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned to return home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
About 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin, two bombs were initially detonated in a suburb on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two sets of bombs went up again, according to authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb blast was also reported from Phuket in the early hours of the day.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, according to police.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
The bomb exploded in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injured.
One assumed a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings bear the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters early Friday.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, however, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesman said in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities have received intelligence in recent days on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and locations.
It is unclear which group was behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they are usually not aimed at tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bombings, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised against unnecessary travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (Security Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the years to come.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, has maintained itself to the benefit of having brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to control the rebellion of Muslim rebels that has been raging for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identity Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government also monitored the group.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of efforts against the free democratic basic order," said the head of constitutional protection, Hans-Georg Maaßen, to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
We are also observing the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities".
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated with the state authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the Identity Movement are trying to pick up their target group where they stand," the head of the Constitutional Protection said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists would do the same as right-wing extremists.
This is not advertising for your own business.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable to this.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - changes its aims by certain extremist persons and thus becomes extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maassen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that more right-wing terrorist groups or mini-groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognisable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were committed against people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations have not previously been known to be criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who, for example, voted for the CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist mood swings."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
It is not always the Olympics or world records that determine the titles of the Olympic Games.
This is demonstrated by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia floated so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habe subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a 48-second lag and ranked 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special start-up right by the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more popular.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habe just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as "the whale robber".
Based on a "prosperity belly", the English boulevard magazine "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he hit only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to run alone in a run over 100 meters freestyle.
Freneticly, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neues Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop on Monday at around 5:30 p.m., forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cashier.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at an election campaign event in Florida.
If the US presidential election doesn’t happen, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would not care: “In the end, it will either work or I have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
He referred to US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terror militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently large.
The Post is also planning to sell its electric StreetScooter.
Soon the group will start trading with the transporter.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
“We want to enter the sale to third parties,” a post spokesman said on Friday.
For months, the company has been considering whether to sell its own StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
Post-Board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles soon.
In the stationary production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wants to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and is looking at a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on German roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the seat of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become all the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him are missing.
Turbulence at the helm of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate management, the global number five in the industry is about to begin again.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, will resign from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board of directors was taken over by Gerhard Hausruckinger, a former member of the board of directors, on September 1, the company said.
He is to officially assume the role of a "Board Speaker" until a successor to Hartmann is found.
As the reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor groups said on Friday that shareholders were last disappointed by the continued failures of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will become restless at some point.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 after losses in the previous quarters.
With <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Regarding the first half of the year, sales fell by 3.4 per cent at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter were mainly affected by the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>139 million corporate depreciation required in the Consumer Experience business area resulted in a loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>148.2 million to the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slids in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich county) involving 43 senior passengers.
Two of the inmates were seriously injured, police said.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid a truck that was partly on the opposite side of the road.
The bus got off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firefighters rescued the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on State Road 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum by a line bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
As of 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3.44 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater plant area instead of 2.10 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp, 3.36 euros (to date 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (to date 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage charge will be increased again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an exorbitant calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the Kulmbach Landratsamt approved the budget, it was found that these sewage systems are undercover.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the wallet.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Administrative Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the sewage facilities of the market municipality.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-coverages from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt argued that all three sewage plants were relatively small facilities with a very low sewage intake of between 6,800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants was slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, not least because of their age, repair and renovation expenses were significantly incurred for all three plants in the backward calculation period.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up, and at the pond treatment plant Lopp had to dig out the first sewage pond after almost 20 years of operation, dispose of the sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation possibility in order to maintain the water-legal requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period accordingly."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low sewage in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "completely beat".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared large living costs at the sewage plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since it is not possible to extend the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal by these plants, because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, there was an increase in the price of the following groups of consumer goods compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); and health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unflinching, characteristic-turning tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All wrongdoings come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past for accusing them that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter to some users this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injurious clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was “injurious and, to put it mildly, unpleasant.”
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all have in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss its employees’ cultural backgrounds, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a HR manager who focuses on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said she would close her Snapchat account and added, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership fakes ISIS intelligence information, finds congressional committee
U.S. Central Command military personnel altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, produced by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State.
The Central Command, abbreviated Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically stolen by senior Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," the report said.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
While it does not provide any direct indication that top government officials under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, that’s so clear,” Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans brought the Task Force to life after being told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for making intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat on the committee.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaging morality among analysts and “gave excessively little room for dissenting opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no indication that the White House had intervened with the Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which were recorded following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigations were still underway.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent views on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important national defense issues.”
The investigations have repercussions beyond the issue of a successful U.S.-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
Last year’s accusations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only made a small occupying force in Iraq foreseen, and shortly thereafter claimed to have been an occupying force in 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker found that, contrary to government statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-held refineries had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have operated to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is about to
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever having done that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
But she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympics and are in first place in their group with the British, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group of six teams will each get the first and second place.
The first-placed will be a little longer than the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Regardless of how the game ends on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising swirl through their success story, four years after landing on the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the United States national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team, and so things began to turn for the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn't have the work schedule in London that we have now.
We were able to rip the rudder off completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhandle from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the standings from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and hoisted the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it’s the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and unavoidable, a fast paced race between competition and aspiration.
It’s as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that goes from the breaststroke to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in the Olympics for the first time and a women's swarm with pits, could well have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fetter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I am modestly allowed to make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the past 16 years that many of those I had surveyed didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 had had an athlete who managed to make it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cardboard trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much as "jumping board."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements (turnings, axes and jumps) before landing on their feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
In their quest for gold, medal-winners must go further, faster, up and beyond, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in television broadcasting they are also chasing another ridiculous goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to stir even a spectator’s tears.
But it’s also what I find tiresome about watching these games myself.
Of this, the trampoline offers a pause.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved by targeting and objectifying male athletes — as the male U.S. tournamentrs recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal — then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during gunfights.
Is Ethiopia on the verge of collapse?
In the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are probably from last or early this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights agency is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy was expanding at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the suppression by the government – the opposition in the country has been restricted, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you suppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to suffocation in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this thorny, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and re-arme themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface after years of boiling.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said that they had gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have thrived in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But this is also changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6% of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the South.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that analysts reported were apparently stolen from the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in recent months, and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked shops run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin trek."
Donald Trump Says Obama Founded ISIS Was “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign, stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his fellow fighters, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the odd position of having to explain statements he might not have meant at all.
After making the hint at an election campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rushed back regarding the allegation on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is beating down on Mr. Trump as he tries to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling poll values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to come back to this issue again.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but later he declared “Of course I meant it sarcastically.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to ‘clear up’ depending on how the reaction is,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of de-escalating the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more egregious tone as his poll values have further declined.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the spotlight in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania election campaign on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of running around on every word he said and being biased against him.
He mocked the “poor, pathetic” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just further evidence that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once overpriced from the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash that did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was displaced by the prices from its Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, except Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept up a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, had previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After closing the verb, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was about the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his everything bag with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudge that the soap business had taken over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop would like to put the cold-brewed coffee in bottles and sell it.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "ample meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a knack for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland tortoise soup.
His menu on that day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book, 97 Orchard, tells about living in a residential home on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", which will appear in Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snug snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe smiled.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with the fact that it was no longer the Schlaraffenland.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe began, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole as a “wonderful way to recycle food residue,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide unsatisfying ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange blends were tried because a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunchtime," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—drive the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pampes like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports on the government’s response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-me-Cake-Eat attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt’s hiring of a housewife with no interest in tastes led to the White House producing Washington’s most boring food, but also one of the most despondently prepared.”
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple said they had better understood Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits when writing the book - for example, how she couldn't throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew up a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called prune whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the thick, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe took a recap three times.
Like a can-do budget animal, he told his wife, "A couple of chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has so far saved nearly 60,000 lives.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil defender showing him saving an 11-hour-long baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horrors of war.
However, he never saw himself as a hero, according to the image, he said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
“If I am dying to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died and seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the poisonous remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the image quoted his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks do not breed until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h – and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.
However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers don’t know much about the Greenland shark’s lifestyle.
They measured their timing when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks make prey anyway: In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be chasing dormant animals or patrolling the bottom of the ice sea, looking for corpses swirling down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught from the depths of the North Atlantic off Greenland or Spitzbergen between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters long.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth was supposed to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts dropped larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, on the other hand, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it was probably celebrating its 50th birthday when it was examined in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 watch for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter shark is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are more than four meters long.
Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.
Since one of the 392-centimeter animals was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously breed for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also expected to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
That such methuselahs live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose bacon had a 120-year-old harpoon spike on his neck, was also captured outside Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In addition, to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss from a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building plot in double package
In the recent meeting, the City Council focused on issues related to construction.
With relief, the panel accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After clarification of the land, plotting and development issues and the applications could be submitted for surveying, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer prevented.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and rustic seniors alike.
As it was said, construction plans can be reported to the town hall from now on, the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting.
In order to also be able to comply with requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises, in connection with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the newly created land use plan in partial areas only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, IW’s Head of Financial and Real Estate Markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is unclear whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they need to be admitted to the UK.
This is being used by large U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The Frankfurt Main Finance lobbying association expects 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which brings together the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board, speaks.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities," says Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, but the infrastructure is worse than Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Also, the city scores with readily available commercial properties.
“It’s not that easy to find free, high-quality offices in Paris,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are 50% higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a Mercer ranking, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, according to economic researchers.
According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct on Merck’s part, including misconduct and misconduct on one hand.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, U.S. Justice Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to an award for the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to resemble Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of lab work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medications.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are combing through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They liberated over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters of the DKS-aligned Manbij Military Council.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which yielded the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have published their tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and backtracks regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the move,” Clinton’s campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the announcement of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations to charities, his business and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled upon the issue and posted a video on the Internet Friday in which top Republicans call on Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on business in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers as saying that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is headquartered here, called on Trump to hold a meeting on their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump was “fearful” of voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has issued tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they only covered $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton’s dividends and earnings were taxed at USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili peppers, fireworks promote Tanzania’s elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms at them that are filled with chili peppers.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without damaging the elephants,” said Damian Bell, CEO of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A hint is usually enough to drive the elephant out.
One last possibility is a thrower that blows a gold-rained firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kiosk neo-building on the St. Goar Rhine bank
Normally, St. Goarer investment projects are accepted by businessmen with a kiss hand - but retail in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request to build a new sales kiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new operators, but this kiosk does not fit at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine coast," Michael Hubrath told the CDU faction.
Jewish director beats Berlin hotel after removing Israeli code after 'Arab' request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix as it “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" released his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center.
After searching for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "intentional decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind that triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a “great shame,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "supplied" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the allegations and called the incident a "failure" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order not to include Israel on the quick list," a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel told the South German newspaper.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to protest government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, which resulted in the police employing rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstrations to express their outrage over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests came a few days after protesters took to the streets in mass to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote on her dismissal.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking on existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran jumped by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The upsurge in trade was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign mission issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Searched for witnesses: Beverage market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery took place on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the pretext of a gun, three darkly dressed people, who had disguised their faces, demanded from the employees of the beverage market the release of cash, and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver VW golf.
How much money was stolen, the police did not say.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, relatively small.
The drinks market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car park entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the robbery (at 7:45 p.m.) should report to the police.
Nagold: play and fun during summer time
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the Nagold Children’s Protection Federation with their caregivers on their summer holidays in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located recreational home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was housed during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
First of all, we went to Bretten with the visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s guided tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invites you to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and caregivers were pampered with their own prepared body foods such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and the Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the trip home, the sun was laughing and the children and young people returned home happy.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage to Rome of all ministers in two years, the St. Anna Summit has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided to visit the Bishops’ City of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the gate of Mercy open for this purpose at Freiburger Münster.
16 minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and holy chambers set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims to a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and bestowed the pilgrimage blessing.
From Horb it was taken by train to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a monastery of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage path was taken by the monastery.
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.
But also on the way, the minis stopped at crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song together from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays, parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as refreshing dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gutenbach.
Days later, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, had to descend at about 500 meters above sea level in sunny heat and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a joint barbeque at the bathhouse in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, I thanked God.
At the evening fair in Münster, the ministries who arrived at the pilgrimage destination were greeted by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we took the train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner rose to fame last night in the men’s sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on himself. The young sponge made the legend proud as he stormed home to take home a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place at the World Railroad Championships in London in March, despite Hoy’s resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in a timely manner as Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny – who won with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes lagged shortly after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell out Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph with Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, “It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stands.”
We have been working together as a team for the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that awaits us successful five days in the velodrome.
With the shape of Kenny, it is in the sphere of possibility that he repeats Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would be like today's.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be defeated as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They reached the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with commissioners before qualifying yesterday when he was summoned by officials to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympics and pick up a host of medals.
After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas were taking place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of such figures as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the Portland smelter is in question due to the repeal of the energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum smelting in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all supply contracts, as the energy supplier announced.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to the plant’s operation.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s smelter in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means additional physical demand for power from the smelter,” the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called “securing deals” that were supposed to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in “expectation of termination” in its annual statement.
Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts did not affect Alcoa’s “capacity to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even though it still owes an explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to analysts’ statements earlier this week, Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as a power generator, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the all-popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up).
This is the cliché-obsessed plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?", with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast site at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to beat her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on the lookout in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of the year for Vogue.
With a size that resembles a ribbon rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the magazine, 615 pages were advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who are models" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar-winning and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the scum of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the disgust seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising for your foundation by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she's on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Municipal Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of aid are dismissed from community law centers annually, while the industry is assessing the impact of further funding cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unfair displacement and the like – are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance when applying.
The legal services of the municipality, which are already overburdened, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s community rights centers, said the National Association of community rights centers’ latest survey found that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the important services you need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and overwhelming debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unfairly fired – all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Senators from Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal rights centers and their client communities, and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February pointed a gun at an employee while they were on the road in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and hit the run in Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoints judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands damages from the Campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, could not be reached for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign so far.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could lead a little further, this is not possible according to the Berlin polls.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only a short distance from the CDU, which could reach 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The left would reach 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country’s parliament.
Despite slight losses, the Greens moved back into the Schweriner Landtag with 6% (previously 8.7%).
The NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3% each.
In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD, according to the survey, would only reach 23% (election 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the entrance unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in a loop: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now available with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an “office in the pocket format”.
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to reach a lot for standards at the time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was reachable.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be unfolded similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has changed since then.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold to Microsoft.
The market today is dominated by vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time and everywhere, that’s everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition to this, the well-functioning business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to operate via touch screen.
Apple’s triumph began, and even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the reluctance.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors such as Samsung now have the say.
20 years after its invention, the smartphone is a matter of course.
On average, every German now looks at their phone 88 times a day.
“We all need to learn to put the smartphone away,” said Janina Kugel, the company’s HR board member.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as it was back in 2012 in London, when we put a lot of effort into making sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And we will achieve that again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow’s enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 – which was voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, which was built amidst the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will be one as well.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking equate to a “cat and mouse game.”
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to again block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize what part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and those around it has been going on since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has targeted ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “ad preferences tool” to give people more control over advertising targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a sluggish tool, which is why instead we’ve focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman seized in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman took to the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overwhelmed by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened into what is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent murder after she assaulted and killed a man who lay on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere, could have once exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and was still slowly spinning.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect against rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to a lack of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado’s alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision, noting that the club will immediately seek a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking for a long time over the course of the summer and a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches scored a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, put on strike
Labour struggles over wages for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all parties to the dispute sit at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute settlement process,” the company said in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day sessions over the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to rethink the issues.
The unions said their latest strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates on its contractors in the North Sea by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
For its part, Shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to quit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was aggravated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected, compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler Measures Rotation Rate of Stars in Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotational periods are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades’ star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their “dance shoes”.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star on the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signing under a ten-year contract has provided him with $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and the Yankees since 2005 he made some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be admitted to the baseball hall of fame.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the field.
Already in 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is believed to have received performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the lockdown was reduced to 162 more matches.
"The league could have done me a favor for 2014 because I've been playing for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again get the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be in a relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy statements from fans of the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases of doping
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete nearly won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silvia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions, these news come out of time.
Chen had already detected the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to take part in the 50m freestyle runs.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and requires Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement, "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio leaked the news about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” this was “an incredible shock,” she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample was already positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes are not drawing the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class of up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone, like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another severe blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the start of the entire Russian team, except for an exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan race nation is also producing many bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the previous offenses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinkish purple."
"When I see the podium over 200m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to pass a three-month lockdown.
Data Hacking: How Perfidious Hackers Blackmail Their Rescue
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were victims of a ransomware attack at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes multiple times.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their ransomware, according to Malwarebytes’ observations, in attacks on corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the ransom potentially to be blackmailed is significantly higher than for private users.
“We are currently witnessing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware,” Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski said in a statement.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks was frighteningly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money – mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where private users have a personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stands still.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activity, in one case people were at risk of death.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem with it," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of the offenders in the face of downtime in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers have investigated user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate partly hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the job, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: “An individual can write a ransomware within about a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with the dissemination," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now well known to many companies that are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of enterprise IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to deter ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“When data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get an Internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the switching off of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for All Cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not appear narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top drops a little.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the backrest can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should be able to do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol tank with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the direction should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Track Hold Assist.
The Collision Warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles when ranking as "advanced objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and slows down the speed if needed.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much, will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable for: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is conceivable only in the case of hazards that are typical for air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf) argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay any damages to the man.
Illness case: when the organizer pays
Sick vacationers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family suffered severe diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family thought the trip was flawed – and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
Indeed, the sewage treatment plant was defective.
However, the organizer only learned of it shortly before the plaintiff left.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgement.
In particular, no contaminants were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is a general risk to life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state needs to respond consciously and resolutely at the same time to terrorist attacks.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the approval of the population for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, namely "in a medium four-digit order over several years".
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance should be improved, the right to arms should be updated in such a way that it is especially difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed according to de Maizière’s words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger to citizens, he said with a view to, for example, psychiatric issues.
In order to counteract the radicalization of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to pursue criminals in special areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was a blow to the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full cover-up to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you reject, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate force and ability to act with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Floating sayings and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country."
Improved traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly stands on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But this should change: the right-wing curve should be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who get stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16/17), the state-owned road construction company will extend the right-of-way lane by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then turn right directly from the Hammer Road.
The big advantage: the traffic divides earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder annoys the motorists, especially between 5 and 7 pm.
On working days, the backstairs reaches the bridge via the Albersloher path and sometimes beyond.
The needle hole on the B 51 is just before the exit of Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only steered one-lane over the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the necessary load-bearing power to accommodate mainly two-lane heavy traffic.
How long this bottleneck and the associated work-day congestion will last, the competent national company cannot say.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand corner, the state-owned company has deliberately chosen the weaker time during school holidays because of disabilities.
Traffic will pass by the construction site on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's Association, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 attended the staging in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Jungen Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming period as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language training are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
Given the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to want to participate.
Rain instead of star sniffing: hope for better weather
The weather has made the Starbucks guckers in southwestern Germany on Friday night a blow to the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was poorly suited for observing the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will see a lot of stars in the sky.
Perseids are the fastest star scavengers at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening one wanders around forever, at night one stays awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer possible to think of sleep long before the alarm bell rings.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep is often or permanently unresting.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by various causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disturbance.
It is precisely through sleep that many people feel as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German Association of Home Physicians with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What Is Behind Sleep Disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioral factors, as well as medications, may be behind this.
Not uncommonly, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common, especially in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors affect each other.
For example, if you have a pancreatic infarction, you may feel bad, wake up every two to three hours, and may start to think about everyday problems and concerns, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor, White advises.
The disorder can look very different: you are tired, tired, insomniac, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any resident sleep doctors in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the GP, White advises.
It can be clarified with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, on snoring with breathing agents, on sick daytime fatigue, on sleepwalkers or if the cause of sleep disturbance is not found, Fietze explains.
You don’t really have to prepare for the exam.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't go to bed for lunch," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping ends.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can attach to for better sleep.
Weess counts on: regular sleep and waking times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and this is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Shorthair Championships in Doha, setting his first world record.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now defended himself from his criticised former teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 prize and a jungle king <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should be surprised by missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the subject of doping or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
The same should be said of countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS, must not participate," demands the election hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Band of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Dusseldorf police arrested two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport area recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, and had acted jointly, part-time and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had specifically arrived in Germany for the commission of criminal offences.
In total, they had looted more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime a remnant of stone paving: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like it at first glance, but the police consider it to be one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioshop.
On the facade of a grey house someone sprayed "ugly!"
In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, in recent weeks, articles about this "trend district", as the relevant real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferably pictured with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.
Berlin interior senator Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly called for a tough police action against the project since the beginning of the year, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous force.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been evacuated on June 22, the police patroled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled out under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many locals: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a slap in the face that most wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between the occupiers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
Household occupations and the housing projects that resulted from them have long been part of Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to Riga.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under great police orders, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited in part today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world: with them now residents from GDR times and former house-occupiers share their interest.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in the case of new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognized by thrown-in slabs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: Crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is reassuring: the people in 94 are their neighbors, who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed in Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
New builder has deliberately moved into Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important to her that the locals get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, who in July all of a sudden claimed the authority of interpretation over the neighborhood.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are condominiums, after all, which are not of interest to many here - people who are not so well-dressed are more likely to live here," she says.
"I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction."
But what to do if no one listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For residents who are annoyed by color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves out should be aware of this – just as someone who moves into a pub area can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee representative
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine, a customer from the working group, suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-laying wool-milk sau, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less ridiculous rather than targeting the multitude of desired tasks - had meant when the administration wanted to tender the job.
We sought an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying wool milkshake.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
It is primarily about organization, working with people on the ground and also behind the scenes, as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.
She has limited a 50-percent position to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the enlisted refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility shifts from the local council office to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
De facto, the administration does not find private housing.
It has not worked so far, as one is dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, municipal dwellings must be compensated, as it is so beautifully called.
Soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.
However, it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," reports Regine customer.
Many work in the building yard or help housekeepers, do charitable work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is not “employment therapy.”
Activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, administration and volunteers jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The length of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
This is all a “mommy job.”
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent incidents?
"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some may call naive". A residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.
However, the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also a matter for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would completely defame them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and volunteers have to look for activities on site and in the region.
In doing so, they always have in mind that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
In fact, it is unfair to place them on site.
"In Urbach we have not yet reached where we were going," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already tired of integrating the previous people wisely.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Thieves with helicopters searched
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men violently entered an apartment in a multi-family house on Lindenweg at around 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and beat the unholds into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, both wore blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to downtown.
The police deployed several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to search.
The search went without success.
Eventually, the unknowns appeared before the act near the apartment or during their flight.
