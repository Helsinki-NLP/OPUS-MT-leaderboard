The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation in general.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has once again "knocked out" members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they master the notorious slang that has become a citizen in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark in relation to these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm rather a newcomer to Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina – a political veteran – also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf".
"That's the only expression of those you present to me here that I use occasionally."
"Otherwise, I don't like slang very much."
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June before the ODS election congress, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "starring", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to participate in the conversation first, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things and how the Civic Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge that.”
“It’s important to me how we understand each other in our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor of Bem, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, is the talk.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly grasped during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, adding to security: "But I know this more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm probably going to have to take a language course."
The Golfloch is then not only deciphered by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Environmental Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> as Blanka Tunnel.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even guesses where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is quite close to solving the riddle, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>eks companies.
According to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he claims to have obtained this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there does not appear to be a similarly civilized slang among the Social Democrats.
“I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there’s really no such thing with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulda" by his party colleagues.
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Counsellor Weinert is friendly to the party peers of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who before the elections made himself known through machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" (famous Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the use of intra-party language.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Knuckle Rights" allegedly has to do with Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>'s title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common societal characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this by helping to work and giving birth to children," a nun describes the situation, which in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso takes care of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure designed to stop the "witch hunting."
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
Accused of witchcraft is common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men – they poured oil over her and simply lit her on fire.
The incident was reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would have been only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
After the group tried to "expel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Freezers of human souls are as dangerous as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president himself got involved.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called on Shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, violently abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: he heats in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly underserved man is leaving the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just serving a prison sentence.
All three have just been raised in the framework of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is expected to raise 4100 kroner next year for a 2-bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal furnace," he taps angrily with his finger on the new lease of his son, for whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains, half upset and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "improper and immoral", advises tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, at which it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man is just waving off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region will thus become a major "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is facing most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-friendly rent.
Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already bursting at nine o’clock this Tuesday morning.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call machine.
"Lease 2011", so a special touch panel on the touch screen shines.
Shortly tapped and the device spits out a number plate.
We barely deciphered the number "157" and it already whistles on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rental, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rental at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
Starting in mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new lease agreements flatten most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rentals in the customer center has been open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it is only the beginning," the ladies behind the counter respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former mining dwellings are a breaking issue.
Before the elections, the parliamentary vice-president from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, had taken up this issue quite aloud, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"They couldn't even replace the toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning of the interview said.
So far, according to the employees, retirees are mainly standing at the counter to see if they will actually receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease contract until December 15 will also benefit from a half-reduced February lease.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 was due to here," the switching officers estimate.
RPG offers both on their websites and wall boards individual rental agreements where it seems necessary.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal approach," RPG said in a statement.
“Nobody goes to court here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer center gives her at least part of the reason.
"I have 13,000 pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court case," he says.
The employee will be unsure.
"I'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and people are still waiting," she said.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011, and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest $4 billion in rentals in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be $5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the cushioned chairs in the waiting room of Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red-lit information appear again and again.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31,200 homes, that is, more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month", reads the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments in RPG’s portfolio have a 38% increase in rent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase in extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
With 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not leap up the rents, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another commitment: All revenue from the rent increase (see chart) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - first and foremost, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything involved: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings originate, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-garden.
In wise anticipation, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is committed to ensuring that the designers return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the ability to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The construction engineers and architects are thus easier to manage their demanding profession and childcare.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the Arch.Design staff and, with the support of management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment were procured and for a period of 2 years qualified personnel and operations were provided.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are taken care of by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but the day varies over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the corporate hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, eliminating the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Therefore, parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also formed here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi’s interiors
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are torn-down fish moths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the shell-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only when you look closely that you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire facade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swinging lines and engulfed shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even gull holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877, carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old and building an entirely new building, but ultimately agreed to Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper renovation.
However, the Casa Batlló rental house was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on his dashboard that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created, and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also contributed to the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house got its organic forms from the local inhabitants due to the nickname "bone house".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "glowing house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system that was unique at the time, with venting ducts and typical fireplaces.
Something strange is already affecting its 45-degree slope.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was not in any way fooled by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded remediation.
Among other things, the councillors also encountered the fact that the building, with its pillars, even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, no changes were made, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's request for such a change, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the 3rd floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could conveniently chat without having to renounce a certain intimacy during more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors as a result of Gaudí's renovation of a new facade.
Impressive is Gaudí’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only this year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a rather lucrative business, the visits were kept, indeed they were also extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a stamp, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards receive a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the inhabitants of the house and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
These, however, must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, size, state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust must be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house that is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned over regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are still lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is not excluded that it forms under its mold.
Of course, what you are accustomed to also plays a role in the election.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Although all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their shaved shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That’s why I bought these mattresses with visco foam to many ice hockey players years ago, but also to other customers.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed, in other words, it is directly absorbed by the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you don't roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (burn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, one should still take into account the length of the soles of the feet, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm bed width available, i.e. together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For comfort and also for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the upholstery and room designer, who for years has also focused on the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of this furniture.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grate at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the mould layer and the fine padding.
"You should not feel the feathers by hand or by sitting down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and mattress, like siamese twins, have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve) after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, and even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its If and But.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of washable, detachable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are usually made with a round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immeasurably important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often has to do with the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no already in it) and use mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring cores and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
For non-adjustable lattice grates with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamels), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for grates with a larger number of lattices, i.e. of 28 or more spring strips, with lordose support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
Adjustable slatted gratings do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed in or even bent so as to allow the shoulder of the sleeper to be punctually lowered.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too, a rule of thumb: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the side layer, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils such as castor oil and soybean oil are increasingly used to make polyurethane foams.
Soybeans are used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic means mattresses whose core is made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also afford microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents while sleeping.
Again, there is a difference between a man and a woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers have a "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm while sleeping.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have to pay 7000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses, however, are usually charged a lower value added tax, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco-foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is available for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to huge overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fires, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear about their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have turned the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka into fear and horror, so they keep looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of a breach of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be misused, for example if you put them in someone's pocket without them knowing, but we have not had a case like this so far."
“Most customers really buy it for safety reasons,” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out, however, that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don’t want to be controlled.”
“Earlier, the mobile phones had high expectations from parents, but they are just as easy to turn off as these new surveillance devices,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper almost always checks whether the child has any electronics that could be used to locate it."
“Today it’s the phone.”
“If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sales would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"For more expensive devices, even a tilt gauge is integrated, that is, if you fall down and stay motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform smart phones with navigation, you only need to record a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either devices in plywood box size that resemble trailers or smaller phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are therefore being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or locating device.
"Or he only notices that after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time lead," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the location of vehicles.
So it is about the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like when navigating in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic but keep them for only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, with sets of explosives to be ignited.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have served for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the joint-stock company STV Group, among others, for lipstick 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff of MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, this indicates that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be half justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stockpiles would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies, that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the aforementioned 225 years through these new purchases - also in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that firing exercises of the missing funds are severely restricted.
Not to mention the shorts shorts.
"I also don't care why they buy so many spark plugs from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need them for.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer want to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, says the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cords would have covered the army with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445-kilometre ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood Army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of its life.
Already because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus reliable ignition cords remains open.
The Ministry of Defence has already had huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty period, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People’s Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who approached MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old ignition cords, which they have bought so "cheap" today.
To this day, I still have the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning position in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" has helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a movie screenplay.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun likes to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware that there is a lack of good accommodation options at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a building house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something against it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then remodeled step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already applied," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large part of this licensing for the operation of hotels was just the victory in the competition "Entrepreneur of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun gratefully.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even afterwards and I have to say it did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend anyone who wants to do something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win immediately, every visibility is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come at all.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also hits a little on each of his employees.
And there he is in the seventies.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I really don’t see this as just personal success, no, it’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name is just a little in the foreground," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Last year, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, the owner of Farmet, received the prize for the first rank of the Vodafone company competition of the year.
At the time, the jury commended the efforts made by him to start a small toolmaking company in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice that generates hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also all of my employees and has strengthened our confidence in the fight against the competition,” says the last year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop to lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, and founded his own company with a few comrades from his father's position to the factory.
Shortly afterwards, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have grown to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also became aware of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to measure greater value," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, Farmet was not only in the sign of the victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic performance in 2008 and part of 2009.
And precisely 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at the time shook even less citizens, but above all companies, had just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation.”
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to make concessions - in terms of investments in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All of this shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy at the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the “absurdity of the year” is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules have already been removed from the world.
To the dubious winner of the next decade of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
More than one-third of not-so-four-thousand-voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require any excerpts from the trade register in the future when checking social security payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová, spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to meet and abolish the nonsense.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organized by the Czech Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
When the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder the business activity.
"As for the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of the company’s terms and conditions, an eight-place lower ranking compared to the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was declared for the first time in a year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the editorial competition at the end of September.
The web address for registration is www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It conquers the absurdity that gets the most votes.
This year’s opinion poll has already received more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay a toll for highways and highways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The opening of the competition at the beginning of November on the Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws a knock between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic revival, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year that make today's entrepreneurs still unnecessarily difficult their undertakings," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to make senseless arrangements out of the world are effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the obligation imposed on the entrepreneurs to have to report to the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to want to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of a novelty of the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which received the second-largest number of votes in 2007, the obligation to report to the office the business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days, was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
To the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation was chosen, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the requirement for refrigerators dropped.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
“We would like to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of their entrepreneurial activity and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of this competition, as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
For this year’s first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offered enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, it is about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, appeared the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the formation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper mill in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady is also exemplary in caring for its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Region of Mittelböhmen"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluent and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to keep the environmental impact of our business and administration as low as possible,” explains its managing director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region, in turn, is committed to the health of its employees and for this reason it has procured them ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, in addition, it promotes its employees at home work and in corporate transactions it uses Cartering services, which are protected by a local workstation.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>ishtení" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance, is also worth mentioning.
"We are granting our employees contributions for food, for the way of work, for increasing their qualifications and for the holidays," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the Responsible Company of the Year category, all Vodafon Company of the Year district finalists were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer by August 15th at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year, they were not disqualified."
“Separate registration for this competition alone is not possible as it is just a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the ground fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and realtor Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate an ongoing public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the land offered in competition fell to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo", unable to provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was fired again by the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition can only be speculated in the light of the scarce official information.
Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund, referred to Právo’s question in this regard as saying that the police had in fact made arrests at the Pilsen subsidiary of the Land Fund during a public competition.
“It was about one client and one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public tender was correctly referred to as "a call for tenders for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the land offered.
"These persons shall offer, within the framework of the request, a higher value of their claims for reimbursement to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," the fund's spokeswoman explains.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information available on who had signed up for the call and, since he himself was entitled to a number of refund claims, he offered to withdraw from the competition to an interest in the property.
Evidently against a greasy payoff.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had already had far too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds for which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. also acquired land from the Land Fund, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access highways to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the Magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The town hall had to give a heavy heart at the time in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
As of January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and rentals are also growing for district heating and in some places.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner a month more from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places the district heating supplies will also be more expensive.
Electricity alone costs households a few hundred crowns more each year.
Power prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, so the reason is the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
While gas will only become moderately more expensive, this is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here, too, we can expect a few hundred more crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor more per month for district heating from January onwards, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 kronor per year.
In turn, residents of Prague face 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be abolished from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to judicially interest him.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also a good whiskey, which was stolen from the father's house bar.
These are the drinks that drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need emergency treatment.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evidenced by the experiences of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, chief physician of the children's department at the Central Bohemian Clinic Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice.
"Whisky, if it manages to steal a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage of being mixed with juice, so it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the Motol Faculty Hospital, Eva Jurinová, is right.
"Most often it's about Fernet or rum."
“This is the alcohol trend today, especially in elementary schools.”
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," Mrs. Jurinová said.
According to chief doctor Pelikan, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers are no longer an exception in hospital admission.
Before the clinic in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first introduced to the blood with 3.5 perm of alcohol and in addition in combination with ‘ecstasy’,” the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when dealing with their own children that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not about a real dependence in the true sense of the word that children are concerned.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case in these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chief Physician Pelikan.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of pediatrics and adolescent medicine.
However, only those cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by their parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink only once such a bottle of Schnapps in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes, on which one counts 100%: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sadness over the bad testimony or out of joy over the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis night, I also saw seven drunk children at once in the recording," emphasizes Dr. Pelikan.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who struggles only with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which result from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be removed in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They're clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikan, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by at least listing the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by the rescue car and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly for a few tens of thousands of crowns.
“Over and over again, I used this as an educational tool when I calculated directly to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all over the holidays to earn the money for a single such party,” added Dr. Pelikan.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to appeal procedures to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time this type of machine has been in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they have only been seen at maneuvers or flight shows.
The L-159T1 is a two-seater version operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
When she physically expedites the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The single-seat L-159 fighter jets, in turn, were separated from long-term stockpiled aircraft, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry.
"The double-seat L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to go without two-seater fighter jets as the Defense Ministry signed a 200-million-dollar contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159s to the two-seater version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged to implement the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders for the purchase, but directly addressed EADS.
The defense ministry at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army purchased Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa is also likely to have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, the reason being that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European call for tenders and would have failed to respond to a single manufacturer.
The military has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is expected to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is due to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick's Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health strains, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research found that precisely testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK was familiar with the study, but did not believe the relationship between finger length and cancer risk was "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic lies under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road pit.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided here as well.
Drivers should take off right behind Brno at kilometer 190 or over Brno and take off at kilometer 182 at the town of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are miles of traffic jams.
There was also an accident on the D11 and this happened right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimeter thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed in the town of Prosek, the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Stab meets.
There are also problems with the railways and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snowstorms.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
The Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport is closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia can only be driven with increased caution.
In the vicinity of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasionally snowstorms and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snowmills on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three roads completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow cutters for snow removal.
When they will be transportable again, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert dispersants for conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
The U.S. troops have deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the power relationship in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber shots, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode at any point of their ballistic trajectory, not just when they hit the target.
That is, you can use it against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an accurate point of sight, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press off.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When pressed, the weapon loads up and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance industry giant announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park in July next year, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs from the group, which have so far been distributed in the region, should be accommodated there.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the work of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also just a tenant.
Bernd Wagner, managing director, said: “With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based business analyst Markus Frank (CDU) said it had won a “Global Player” once again.
This is a “great location confession.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impetus for lower wheels.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have led to the outcome.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperating."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the town hall square and the neighboring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings at Marienbad square.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, still affiliated with Siemens, acquired the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based German Real Estate Opportunity Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu cono is the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu employs much more people in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry, among others, has its headquarters.
Amazon shuts down servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Possibly, there is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic deputies.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
WikiLeaks is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is expected to stay in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks Displaced by Amazon Server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revelation activists announced via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the internet company Amazon banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle the high numbers of accesses to the documents in the release of the secret diplomatic depots.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks said: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by WikiLeaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted investigations, CNN reported, citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I wish Amazon had taken this step earlier in the face of previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to also refuse use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless actions are jeopardizing our national security and endangering lives around the globe," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted for rape in Sweden, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange rightfully fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
In the meantime, an exchange of blows broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridden and absurd” that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent spying calls on diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website."
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The Deputy Director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed as the Special Representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after Wikileaks disclosed the messages.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice detectors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
Where did all the ice come from?
From the gelatier and from the gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat antique the ice-cooker, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the fridge with a spatula, wipes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you will not be able to pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare to get on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to embody something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelato Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget in his training, however, the cream of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to production seems simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a faucet on the machine, and a pasteurized white base cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is haunted with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own experimental desire?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar seed flour from guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the supermarket candy store.
There are also powders and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, moccasin and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - tasty is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a well-balanced mixture will really highlight the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano draws a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wines measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculate.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously creamy beaten and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small failures do not remain unavailable.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates clog up and down with fruit puree when the oversized batter gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in dusk
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is undermined by the genetically engineered industry.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying association for years.
It is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the EFSA testing regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The EFSA regulations are in part word-for-word with Ilsi position papers and thus threaten the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has denied a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level EFSA manager recently became a member of the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any requirements or transition period - and I have changed sides with this.
The Central German Broadcasting Corporation (MDR) also recently revealed personal links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians have made clear.
However, EFSA cannot detect a conflict of interest.
All reputable data, including those of the industry, can be accessed as long as they are of high technical quality, according to an opinion.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they would have to disclose it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
This is a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – among other things, for the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding trials and the response of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified corn in the field,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how can you find them?”, Then asks the accuser.
That’s what Angelika Hilbeck thinks.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry in this field, as in the USA, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
"The industry controls safety research," Hilbeck says.
The Trail of Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had set off and had begun to break off a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar deepening of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shell lime, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
"A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, it smelled of cigarette butter.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the bricks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all the ones that came after the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace if they were ground to gravel or disappeared in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden building that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remnants of the North Wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21s for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if this happens, then it would be the most sensible if the stones were to be reused.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos-heavy quads, priced from 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has already been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
They came from everywhere and dragged away what the trunk and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the beginning have long been transformed into "mauern" or into limitations of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
“It’s not the political component.”
He climbs into his off-road vehicle, makes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and quit, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he carries together his treasures.
He says he's the Republic's biggest stone dealer.
It's slowing down.
In the snow lie artificially carved sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elb sandstone, yellow, warm, it glows.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the road through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
Once the quads belonged to the podium of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatter Travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Sankt Blasien Cathedral, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were cut earlier by hand and moved with simple bottle pulls and oxen carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if you did something like that.”
He did not become rich, nor did he become rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, as well as stone carpenters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual manager.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There's a lot of buzz in the buffet.
16 students are pressing for salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, together with VW developers, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and also get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums as early as possible before they enter the job market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists about the achievements of their students, they try to spot and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the Automotive Group is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously meet students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperation, says Selle, is not uncommon.
It’s new to be so offensive about the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large crowd of applicants.
But they have to brag and especially jump for highly skilled workers.
Above all, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs were vacant in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes on the hunt for talent for the audit and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern snail hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will be sent across the United States next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dikta, when shoving and stinging around the high potentials at universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to be going up.
"We have had contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are just about to graduate and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to direct budding on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classic at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“At Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, HR manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 jobs on the company’s website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that you can do internships with us or write your thesis."
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation can often not offer this," says Chief Human Resources Officer Stübe.
Money no longer plays a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Personnel manager Stübe also hopes for the placement of plus points among job seekers.
“I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to Krieger, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, internal employer branding means employer branding within your own workforce.
“Happy employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, then they would advertise for their employer on their own with friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with gangs," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A similar ban has been enacted by the government in Washington – and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
For the time being, new drilling operations are also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his readiness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters want to reduce the U.S.’s dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever is responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf is still unclear.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which faces billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which has been defamed on numerous corruption allegations, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of extraction in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," said a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO, ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burnt
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People are living on theft, corruption and illegal oil spills.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illuminate a boy waving to the chest in the water with the slits surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil squads are floating beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow-flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil poured into the huge wetland from a brushed pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-containing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst-hit regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers, the entire extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat rolls up brown broth, who immerses his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black liquorice poles from the ground, sadly leaving palms occasionally found hanging their wedges.
Bird swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, are searched in vain: as soon as the outboarder is silent, ghostly tranquility spreads out in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari, “we’re living in constant danger to health.”
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The settlement of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: here the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it was more difficult to work for <0xC3><0x96>fähr.
Even today, the company is denied a return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Swiss-sized delta region with over 5,000 drilling springs and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable.
Every few hundred meters stand out steel frames like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drill holes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, Akpobari thinks, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year after year the amount of oil, as it penetrated the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the accident of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” – one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be disputed.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell imposes significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: alone the rate of defects in the lines is "much higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open air from a distance, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are split naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by tubes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catcher, later drips out at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel per day: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The price of diesel, which is ridiculously low at nearly 40 euro cents per litre, can still be underestimated by illegal cooks: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who cross the pipeline network through Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil daily throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a disappearing small part of the interim raw material is being illegally refined: the lion’s share is being filled by organized criminal networks, which should include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, in tankers and are squeezing it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more due to the displacement of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had they not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen’s livelihoods, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell, in particular, has been so devastated that only one excerpt from the group would be questioned: “Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, are doing better.”
Michael is getting nervous.
"It's high time you disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Any minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but perhaps a painful lubrication.
Even the soldiers, mainly from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous structural defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a big security issue.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error during the investigation of an emergency landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the emergency landing Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently much more fortunate than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety issue with the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigations – and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil pipe connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure”.
Rolls-Royce-made engines in 20 A380-series aircraft were affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a ground of appeal with a federal court in Sydney, Australia, which allowed her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had loosened and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue has been considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
As a precautionary measure, Lufthansa replaced the engine in an A380.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: During the night snow fell almost all over the country.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights are falling out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowed on Thursday night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but it was not finished with the constantly replenishing snow.
In addition, fierce waves swept across the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal from the morning on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein.
In Saxony, snowstorms on highways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia in Saxony Switzerland, the alarm level was purple - the highest level ever.
Partly, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused blizzards.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails, or destroyed overpasses and weirs are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its drive to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescuers.
Winds of snow swept over the roads.
At major German airports, the snowstorms lead to numerous flight crashes.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, several cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous operation.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still nearly 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in the collision with a train on a railroad crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a railroad crossing because the vehicle stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she crashed her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and dusty, it will swirl even in light rainbows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million could be added to the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, citing a spokesman.
The reason for the planned sale was not given by the speaker.
“We’re always looking at whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate yourself and then rent it back,” he said.
With this, Germany’s largest credit institution will relinquish its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only acquired the double towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investors of an in-house fund and then elaborately renovated them.
The energy conversion swallowed the data after about 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn their dead friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies still could not be recovered because the security situation in the misfortune shaft is still precarious.
Just two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were dumped underground.
A probe had been dropped into the misfortune shaft, but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the comrades.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the glowing sunshine in Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up, showing helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags floated on half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He couldn't finish with his son's death until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been dissipated, they will begin to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-locates old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman forces, kills his opponents in ranks - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to paint his angry killing methods.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, doesn’t say a word about the whole film, and the other characters can also be ripped off at most to one or two sets or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it will be silent and swept away in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a movie has multiple audiences, it’s only a pity if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the arthouse with a bit more humor or a bit less brutality.
Most art-kino friends are likely to be deterred by the brain mass and intestines splashing around.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, Inauguration with a troop of violent Christian missionaries sails via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck for an eternity in whistle and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent action, it’s all about atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
There is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly closes his throat, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithful to the eye, is left with something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporary allies will eventually become a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
Walhalla Rising is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire to annoy, excite and amaze.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a stand on this - it still allows controls.
At least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria around midnight on September 5-6, 2007.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the framework, hidden in a valley that flows off the stream.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium – from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technique of the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she blurred where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she submitted photos showing the building from close up or even the interior.
The reactor was shortly before commissioning, it said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly more is known than then, indeed the puzzles have become rather bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor”, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible”.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer replied only lapidarly that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions”.
The debris of the alleged "unused military building" was quickly removed by the Syrians and the site was thoroughly planned.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from a member state immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to have operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – just like it did with satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel also keeps silent irons.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently reaffirmed the official position.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been dragging on without results and "is increasingly evolving into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-containing treaty.
As a key to progress in enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be “functionally connected” to the alleged reactor – and other than this one still exist.
The inspectors have so far not disclosed which plants they are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these locations and found on satellite images a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely on this grounds, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the Euphrates Quad.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there are “no indications of sensitive activities”, i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb would later be separated from, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the debris remained.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste storage facility, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
Images from orbit, however, show that Syria was conducting groundwork at the three suspected sites and removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - just the effort shows how great is the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Were Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Nuclear Control Authority has to implement.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I am open in the future”, but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all but eager to escalate.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives a thought: "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there are problems.
She wrote the screenplay herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Much more is not known about it - but that is enough for unrest.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were shortly moved to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is the ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organization has recommended the dismissal of Jolie as an ambassador.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given the chance to read their script, has after some time granted a filming permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come after all.
The young author herself claims that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film is on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victims get stuck in torturerknecht".
That Jolie’s film actually starts before the war – that’s for sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can bring peace: by illegally posting the script, as so many have done before.
Nothing like away from here
This evening, it is finally going to be a good time for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans yell for joy at loud music, they squeeze with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer mugs - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euros prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this creepy drinking game and the cautious computer scientist, that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun, distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will be conducting interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mummy feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have a job there yet."
After all: his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from ESRI’s Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, there will be 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upsurge that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain for the young, well-educated Irish, who have so far only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are now unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are also letters from young expatriates complaining: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation.”
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a bleak future coming up because the government is only pursuing eye-witnessing and no longer offering young people prospects for the future.
“They’re cutting the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She watches her peers move from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to take the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O’Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just building a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home, as he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept backyards, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O’Donovan bought the house for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 four years ago – 100 percent credited.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours out hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer does not like the grievances he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen – maybe we just feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let’s open up the future and just look at how things are going with life elsewhere.
He’s been working in London for a few years and why shouldn’t he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that really disturbs him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
"Don't blow too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a walk away party, very loosely, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democracy Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results came from the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly visible in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of supporters of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy is recovering from last year’s strong economic downturn.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country’s democratic practices, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Around 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
That this continued even during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were intercepted by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from this week’s UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the rate of poverty in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and dropped again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread forward thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime in the last year, but compared to 38% in the last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in stronger support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress for their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with this role being assumed by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election slap
No one expected the elections in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the voters who rushed to help the oppressed country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballot papers in Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just a part of the problems.
The polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless as a result of the January earthquake, roamed around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged top riders, demanded the cancellation of the election results because of an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "a pretty good one in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily render the process invalid.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is allegedly bound by the impopular departing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope for the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who receives little or no approval from the electorate, declares him the winner of the by-election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, low voter turnout has been feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 passports, which are required for the election, had not yet been distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Hidden in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President Cristina Fernández experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to be re-elected next year depends on whether the apparently mourning Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also directed economic policy after his wife’s election, often drafted budget plans that did not fully take tax revenues, economic growth and inflation into account.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further defeat.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others witnessed the government bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty eradication as his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then beautified the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices of Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth momentum by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to rejoin Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s earlier re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the lenders from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If yes, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely fed up with Churchism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to them will be shattered.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to cancel many of her husband’s political decisions quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the Strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, went to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts, which is rated as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has permanently changed relations with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only briefly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) appoints three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence from Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were common occurrences in Taiwan such as truck convoys with tiemakers, flag-swinging mass moves, and only sparsely-dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man shot him in the face out of the crowd. Lien was wounded and a surrounding spectator killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Line or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has undermined the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing at the forefront.
But this time, the DPP also avoided exacerbating anti-Chinese sentiments too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, on the other hand, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a trader to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing is first.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working people and the youth.
As the DPP's presidential candidate, Tsai found great approval, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party is offering a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's premature rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential nomination.
Even without Chen’s intervention, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a limited rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no turning back anymore.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the Year
If you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the category of Newcomer of the Year.
Given the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist have released the album's highest release, with which he was announced in the three wide.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her cheerful voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be easily compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category comes next to the nomination Spaldings.
The Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favorite and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", has been awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, where albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are more likely to be found.
The secret society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus opposes the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life album "Pathways" is a good example of a democratized band.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra; various Chicago Orchestra's "Sy and Synergy Articry Vercium" by the Castals.
In the opera category were Bergs "Lulu from the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra ArthurIvans "; Sul and Choir of Mariin.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute play is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
“I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated, public hearing.
Critics have accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“As an American, I’m proud of that.”
“It shows that justice is there.”
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise, being fairly evenly distributed.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no America anymore,” one comment read.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand."
“America is over.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque is said to have two minarets and to be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among others, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the previously considered vital elements.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it's almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacteria in California’s Mono Lake still grows when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You’re wondering what else is possible,” said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery “shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can use other elements to initiate biochemical processes and that the ‘standard elements’ that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed,” said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton, United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemically similar behavior to that of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it lubricates almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacteria GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based form of life can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth ages," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibit dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four show dogs — two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis — disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not give any specific information about the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigations are still going on.”
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They picked up their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas – Trace, a 3-year-old shepherd, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch – were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were this weekend due to the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s almost one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's salary, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not yet known whether a finder's salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “preparing” plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which is itself contributing $75 million, is running the company, with funding expected to be up until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an order for investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to resolve MGM’s financial concerns and pay off the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
However, the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
If MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, receives a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of $265 million to $275 million for its financial share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can make a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into force, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider range on the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button-powered toys are coming to the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by repeatedly pressing you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you have started pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers 'Simon says'-like interplays, and thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheel locking, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can make a car ride to a lesson, with a connoisseur with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which after Leaprog's first major revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new image brighter,
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a plywood box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go after the offer in the toy stores alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-operated microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a bumpy garden.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China’s robust guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination to violence – to impress the viewers.
"Stand up right now!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood straight.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"For me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks dismissively.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green one.
In central China, Wuhan replaced violence with low-maintenance: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circumvented an improperly positioned snack cart and stared at the operator until it wrapped up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police strips. They have been selected special because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the rugged police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them using his phone as they beat down a protest against a garbage can.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered a brain injury after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, following further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough clean-up".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits via advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figure and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the age of 26.
According to officials, the activity is too physically strenuous for women over 25.
“The most important thing is their image,” said an unnamed district official on the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguans are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but besides, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city administration of the district, does not wish to comply with this description,
but admitted that in China size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether that looks good is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or buckles here," said Mr Zheng.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple buds and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much value is placed on her appearance.
“Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?” she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the trenches, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their reports, they do not regret the short-term hiring, as they had more ambitious career plans than simply sneaking traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many sandwiches and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Fr. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"All Routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchants’ goods, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is supposed to protect them from public hostilities to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ransacked after rumors surfaced that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers patroled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the pavement instead of in a workshop, contrary to the regulations.
The owner yelled Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials paved their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, stayed behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they weren’t trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we act verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
"Most of the time, people start with the fight."
Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations that were raised against him after his affair with a former electoral aide and his attempt to get her husband lobbying, Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ended the heaviest lawsuit against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada, and up to the scandal that made headlines nationwide and dampened his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “very pleased” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign had been suspended and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice; in her opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election aides, was using lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as the treasurer of Ensigns during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over lobbying for them after Hampton's hiring.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign’s election team, he was not allowed to take on lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on turn-door lobbying.
According to the published indices, “everything seems to be a bargain and a violation of the rotating door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said, the Department seems very cautious in accepting political accusations after a variety of defeats that have been pursued by the media with great interest to the state's former senator, including the decision made last year by Steve Sen.
Attorneys “are obviously terrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, the president of the association Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have filed various charges against Mr. Ensign in court.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his clients.
Mr. Ensign’s defense attorneys had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made against the prosecutors.
"I'm not going to go into the details of the conversation between the Department of Justice and me, but that's all: we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigating a separate lawsuit by the ethics group after a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An email from December 2008 proves that, after the company passed Mr. Hampton on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "slamping" at the Interior Ministry over a matter.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after that Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
When Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents last year for the first time, he gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican ranks.
After not being noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will follow the Department of Justice’s lead very quickly and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Appeal Makes Twitter Sense
Half a dozen of them tipped themselves off in the clutches in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that was on fire.
On Thursday, the carefully pursued trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end when the jury’s death sentence falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications with the courts, stating the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, immediate penetration of disturbing details, so that the jury has been inadmissibly influenced by the public.
This objection could lead the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies would make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes’ Chief Advocate.
Chief Justice Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court, dismissed the motions by decision last week, saying the New Media would be “carefully monitored” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court complaints have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, saying in its ruling that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections, which Mr. Hayes’ convictions a half century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the ways of communication out of the courtroom that were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes being pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make trials more fair.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been preconceived when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her babysitter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with disgust.
Defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he had unduly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the week.
The jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a sentencing appeal they filed last month, they found that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor’s office and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
"Such a daily rush of media whistleblowers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Their focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more uplifting than reports that are being delivered more slowly is a tech-savvy look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said appeals courts would often be confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was repealed on the basis of reporting, and made clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard vs. 21st century Maxwell."
Can politeness connect the separation?
After a campaign of slander and negativity, little politeness has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring about a breakthrough in the big issues that had to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions are made.
After all what you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different parties nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partial point-gathering.
The public meeting of the president's deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that disguises the ideological divide that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one of which calls for a sign of cooperation and compromise from the other, while the same is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or allegations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, donations, health or waiting, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November election has given Washington a mild vote, at least for a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts will end at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on rising unemployment pay is to be expected, even if only because Republicans can’t afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, the optimism has increased that these issues can be agreed during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratified the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even unavoidable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today to 2012 as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012.
The reasons for this have much to do with the appearance of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
As worried as Republican leaders may be about playing too high, they know they have to try to keep their promises of cutting government spending and repealing health care reform.
These party lines will already become clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation, and they struggle very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for flexibility or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and health care system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partialism and polarization are now larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequently far wider election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a harbor of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes a part of the bribe and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the state security service are blackmailing high security funds so they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “Vertical of Authority” – takes its share of the money that the ladders migrate upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beirle, was published Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous libel charges against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Surveys have shown this.
But it is unusual that, as in the report of the Ambassador, individual persons are mentioned, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led some to call it ‘disturbed’ and to the conclusion that the government is acting like a kleptocrat rather than a government,” the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends across the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as throughout the Moscow government.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the top spot."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Ultimately, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any assistance.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing out money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source said: “Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Across the country, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which took place after Moscow time late in the evening, will certainly provoke displeasure within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are being solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we wouldn’t have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such unethical ways, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Forced Veterans to Confront the Past
In a dimly lit, concreted classroom with dirty and bleaching walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to engage in public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a UN and Cambodia community tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia's society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla warfare from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overwhelm the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he awaited his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few Khmer Rouge elite officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, unskilled peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to live a life of poor rice growers.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has raised concerns here as well.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute further acts beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at Cambodia’s Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that allegedly killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
“If there were no more persecution, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved Khmer Rouge textbook, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the High School History Book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court are gradually gaining influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown by bushes and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the outskirts of the street, said she didn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to stop accumulation of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s worldwide nuclear material securing campaign, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
However, U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” in April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)."
“It proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement “a very important, important step” by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh country.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapon-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone.”
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in meeting a deal.
The first attempt to remove Belarus’ uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train carrying more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Disclosure Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the U.S. have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s stern disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible approximation.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the country's progress and its citizens," she said.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents enclosed by WikiLeaks and transmitted to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable), it is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed, "to ensure that the foreigners show up."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing aid to human rights violations in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed it.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "had met Zapatero in absentia" and reaffirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed,” so as not to be “unpreparedly surprised,” Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as these are in the hands of the judges."
Attorney General Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense via the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any damaging or sensitive information," the ambassador said after an interview with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," Aguirre said.
At a luncheon in March 2007, at which the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely keen on their independence and doing what they thought was appropriate," he had given his employees the orders to "blade off, blade off, blade off" to his employees.
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's actions in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, from a hint that the Zapatero government will tolerate or intentionally ignore actions by the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, hitting capital, even if these revelations could negatively affect the U.S. government,” he said.
The child killer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "toughness" of motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she has been in contact with a cousin and at least one girlfriend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know her love life, which the ABC daily reconstructs based on the testimony of her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around in the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and be able to let go of what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she says about returning to her village: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to present myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He will be with whom he has to be, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother again," a dubious intention when one considers their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, Caesar is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She is talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos by e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he finds me such a mess."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He's firing money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (translation) ".
The last man to live with her, an affidavit hunter, declares to have a bite of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Judicial Prisoners in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she did not intend to inflict harm on the little one."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and the PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferential or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's share of votes and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP's analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would win four (she now has 10) from 25 and the PSC would defeat the minimum.
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could retain its MP or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is to be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011 falls. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue in the balance to put an end to the socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the City Council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest 6 million euro for households.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, where it would have to get 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in the transformation of Tarragona, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida has only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party was able to see a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona police station formed the Thailand-controlled jihadist cell, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashttenkar e-Taiba" (Lette P. 10) - the latter was the author in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, going so far as to assure that the “Operation Kampai” has “weakened” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda worldwide and “as a result of its ability to act”.
The researchers assume that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were counterfeit and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could impunity across the borders of European and other western countries.
The cell discovered is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It is not possible to exclude that there will be similar attacks on the territory of the EU in the coming days as the one carried out last day in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani Muhamman Butathan Butharkan and the Pakistani Sibuet Buthain were arrested.
They had led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole tourist passports in particular according to the specifications of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the names of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to carry visa stamps.
Investigative circles pointed out that so far no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay could be detected, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando", which ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas's conditions in support of his assumption of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those already put in place during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic rebound, the regional rebound and the unpredictability of the regional rebound.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with the certainty that she was given the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to make her feel indispensable. Because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist position of the party CiU is dependent on the fact that his vote at least one on the OpU.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible understanding with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC’s party chairwoman is concerned, she calls for “all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia” to be supported, as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region – similar to the Basque country – and that the CiU’s party leader would even be put to a referendum.
It is common for both political leaders to want to slim down the established political apparatus of regional administration and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas’s accession to office are dealt with on behalf of the PPC by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the nursing home in Olot do not exclude that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they exposed the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had inflicted on the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, announcing that "La Caritat would like to indict those responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and the civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a social loss of reputation because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and illness were handled by phone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point and said that "lack of action could not at any time have been the cause of the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there was no evidence in the litigation for negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
He confessed to eleven murders before yesterday, declaring that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that personnel’s access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and sedative cocktail were used by the caregiver in six of the nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from within by giving them bleach, as he confessed to doing in three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the nurse’s statements, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Euro peripheral countries’ risk surcharges have increased dramatically and European banks’ shares have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be deceiving itself and that the euro has barely scored points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical for an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the closure of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as it is ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended “at least until March” and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back again, and if we insist stubbornly that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and the markets would collapse thereafter, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market crash.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year national titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be around 10 billion in the short term and a possible additional 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the bailout are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must get parliamentary approval on its new budget on Tuesday, and as it still does not have enough support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her speech with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, government deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year sovereign bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are betting on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 billion available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed in a timely manner.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now it is not only the being that counts, but also the appearance.”
Just be brave, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen opposes the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the corporate group, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th, at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Vecilia - Bode.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding seems unwilling to surrender control of El Enebro’s organs in his legal dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders’ meeting held on 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the womb of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The summoning of the judge to the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders’ meeting.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to allow the assembly to declare invalid by means of legal pretensions, fraudulent schemes and legal abuse".
This argument is the basis for the retrospective challenge of the assembly to declare it "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists, who shrouded themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide at the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with Siemens secret weapon
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been shaped by the speed of surprises and successes in this exquisite universe.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep upward trajectory during the last seasons, at the finalspurt last November everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari.
Without wanting to downgrade the abilities of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands of, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft, and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industry department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory, "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be detected on the races and during the tests can be designed and executed.
Russwurm states that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the race stalls, who were able to introduce no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly qualified young people, who perform analysis and all possible changes to the race car with powerful computer systems.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the simulator’s virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory to develop and manufacture its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are severely limited.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the services of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose fame is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant’s chief technologist, said five years ago that the progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed, with technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to Open Twenty Own Stores with Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) today inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a 20-store sales network with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted store on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group plans to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive point of sale network is intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and medium-sized businesses when shopping and afterwards, and even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service is building a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical after-sales service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' a million customers in three years
Banco Sabadell’s Managing Director, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a collapse in the interest rate ranges that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years – an area that still remains to be explored.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year framework in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - which is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than it has paid attention to it.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for retail customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will present it together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the plans of banks around the world.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima Guidance Plan, which was originally designed to last three years, but was extended by one fiscal year due to the market situation.
The customers who leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a “difficult” year “with great reach”.
The manager assumes that Spain would only come out of the crisis "slowly".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which penalizes interest rate margins - will fade, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity will already be rolled down to the price of loans as a compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and increase the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of "increasing fees", but "within a framework shaped by competition".
Sabadell’s Lead Plan is based on organic growth, even though the Group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "hugely increasing" and does not preclude some Spanish financial institutions from slipping into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in the case of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he undermines the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing through repo transactions could be achieved and thus the crisis intercepted.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted not to participate in the first phase, they reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the majority of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was about adjustments."
"The majority is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course that was set in the past, not now, in the framework of business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 billion assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have complied with the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a number of unanswered opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed unseriousness and nonsense," because "Banco de España is urging us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” around the world, adding that those who doubted this would do so “without deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic environment, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to maintain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, as well as the management of the 30 percent of the state airports of Barajas and El Prat.
On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which clashes with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark – although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment – is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is unambiguous and has been clear for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the drift between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time obligeing private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it drove the Irish crisis and all that followed.
In the coming months, we will be taking part in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures need to be taken now - from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist.
2013 will be the birth year of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as it was quoted by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us until the spring of 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood that, too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like anything would change.
Among the options considered is that we would have to leave the euro area completely blocked by less reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show a spirit of invention, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being spilled on whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so prevalent that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen about the case presented is that a team of Real Madrid football club (who in his anthem pretended nobility and honor and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added one episode more to his long history than the one he has called for.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to be circumventing its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sportsman should be investigated.
The sports mind defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the offending players taking an unjustified advantage from the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand by misrepresentation or circumvention of rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders took from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was neither put in a disadvantaged position nor gained advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also quit. In addition, players with this procedure get a penalty and go into the second card cycle, where they quit with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
So it is not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to maximize the benefits of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between invention and rule environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic in nature.
Offer Offensive to Catch Customers for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar will drop an avalanche of reservations this year on December 16 and 17.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. You do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, during the pre-Christmas season, there are also group dinners that supply oxygen to Barcelona’s restaurants and leisure businesses. But due to the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to also capture the customer segment, which is the large crowd.
To make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year’s Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations of dinners for two top guests (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many employees pay for it from their own pocket.
Regardless of the economic situation, the lowest prices are being demanded, confirms Gaietà Farràs, president of the Barcelona Gastronomy Board.
The representative of the Dachverband does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'ten times before they book."
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices by 25 euros are most in demand.
A survey of several centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferential reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We have made the impossible possible to maintain last year’s prices with menus for every taste ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros,” he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 venues, one does not lose optimism after seeing revenues flourish again and good prospects for the Christmas business, even if focused on a few days.
Sources from the company group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating before Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more was added as a price hit. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and in return want more details, such as cava.
In some companies too, green shoots are sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back on the rise.
On the part of the Fecasarm Dachverband (with associations such as the Pubs, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Vice President, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations as a whole are quite "lively", although the customers "knock out a maximum".
The fun at the party, however, did not diminish, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concern in U.S.
Islamabad is manufacturing nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
WikiLeaks reveals ties between Pakistan and the Taliban.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the fringes of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad provide, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces more than one other " atomic land ".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack – prepare Washington for sleepless nights.
In a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, cites the following risks: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US alone, but also by Russia as overwhelming and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly credible personnel to monitor its nuclear facilities; because of the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterpart.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that U.S.-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is lagging behind and the increased pace at which Pakistan manufactures nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating": "Often there is no transparency; we do not receive responses to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian state intelligence official, confirmed that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the Supreme Leader of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clearly” to the responsible that “Pakistan’s army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.”
In Search of WikiLeaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorism officer to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to the pursuit and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red alert” to Assange’s “finding and prosecuting.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder’s lawyer, Mark Stephens, said: “The police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are ordered to identify and locate Assange, "to arrest and extradite him provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red alert as a free letter of arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden, where Assange and England.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and that the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security, received the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and his mother from Australia claims her son’s innocence – Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he interviewed the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation as “ridden and absurd.”
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the views of conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has urged the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be “assassinated.”
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason, and anything that is not executed is a punishment too mild,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós with a wink to the Carod Immediate Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party a secret ballot on his continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the tenth time of an internal upheaval in the ranks of the ERC, after losing 11 MPs and half of the electorate vote.
The party leader is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as her mentor himself and will not give him the same headaches as other former leaders.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
To begin with, yesterday he announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could speak secretly about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penalty for the president, they could do so without fearing retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he reaffirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentage values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carods demand more from the president than just the party to provide his office, an inadequate gesture since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce resignations, they will agree with the board on an action plan from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to contribute to the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will submit to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
In return, Puigcercós promises to postpone the congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leadership already believes to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that “polyphony” is detrimental to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by incumbent Councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was being supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructure" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which will allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, who fought for the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 shaking assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the plenary assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still awaited, as infogle of the internal upheaval of the last years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the horizon, the time might have come to take up this matter again and complete it forever.

In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in her neck.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte were discovered as well as chains with corresponding images.
In the last half of a month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men whose heads were covered with adhesive tape, and a message in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a message supposedly signed by a criminal organization, which read: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with torture marks were found inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded in the village of Cuchilla Ancón and wrapped in black plastic bags, next to a message, the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of the village of Juárez.
Next to him, the police found a card with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
At COP16, China said it had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, state authorities had worked with those of the central state and municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was introduced in the last five years and which had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional bulbs through energy-saving bulbs and another on the weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the country’s scientific adviser to the government on climate change, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than commonly accepted.
He showed that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tons per person, while in the United States there are 100 tons. China is responsible for a total contribution of nine percent to environmental pollution.
There is also unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent in the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The National Leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party Chairman has the right to contact the National Commission for Law and Order and to demand what the law allows him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission for Law and Order and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview before the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinosa was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Police Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case so that a decision is made by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged strengthened from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so “we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us”, he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best president that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the relays "to those whom the Council would appoint."
"I'm completely unpreoccupied and open, and I'd be proud to delegate the chairmanship of the party to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's rise in the last July 4 election would be reflected in the next election, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would bear the flag and be observed throughout the country, which is why "a lot of hopes and desires are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is up to the demands."
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc course during his four-year rule, César Nava called on PRI’s supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet,” he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like the ones he made in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral ban and even less censorship.
Obama campaigns on Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge them to pass this law,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act – a law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge them to pass this law,” Obama tweeted.
His brief announcement includes a cyberlink to a larger document, urging the public to contact their senators, as the vote on the bill is imminent.
“With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he said.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except to expand the Bush-era tax cuts and expand government funding.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of the Republican Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
“I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Speaker Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "apply for a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - a law that would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or American Dream Law, would legalize some 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in that country for the past five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or the army.
But the advocates of the bill need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the advocates of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most re-elected Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust for Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, yes, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that was celebrating the Spanish-language literature, and on this occasion she used the subtitle of the other language.
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine writer sweetly spit to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, hosted by Marisol Shultz.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and afterwards characterized the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not tell the answer, but he knows the answer for her.
To infectologists she leaves convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who stole her breath in the middle of the aisle, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the lust for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'praise of invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With hints of magical realism, he tells the story of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-flung men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a twist and told of America, the great novel to which it did not belong to his own chroniclers.
Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told – with imagination that even lost the feeling of shame.
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and that reality and lies are approaching each other, where one no longer knows which side of the story belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the peak.
This is what he calls the Cervantes tradition.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment,” she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment, which builds up between the author and the readers as in a “chemical reaction.”
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also run out on dogmatisms, and it is forgotten that "behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we have to nuance again: and nuance often means to put our finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they put in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in premade ideas a manicured to think of the world without nuances, and black also to put in front of it.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played crucial games three times.
In the final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey, there are also two different styles, predetermined by their respective coaches, and the match marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept up well, which is why this opportunity is of special importance to him.
The Argentinian has made it up with the medal for the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santista strategist reached the first final as a coach at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in hand, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' match, in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to hit again a setback, as the game ended 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the 11th metre he came forward with 3-1 and got two steps ahead of him, but got the chance to hit his 4th title, but to lose the three.
Rubén had already lost two games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be pursued again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, that's why I give myself up, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens first is the most important thing," the driver commented when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assured not to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are on the line is prepared, the players are also, because the last time we were ready with two elfmeters
To know that this series could not be decided by the end of the season or the time of the season, do not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get to the end of the season, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately he was unprepared for it, but unfortunately
It is in Romanso’s power to be no longer just a second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves for visa application before their interview with the consulate at the service points; costs will be shortened waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa change at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their interview at the consulate at the service offices for visa application (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost for the processing of the visa decreases, as it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out separately.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers), and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have a conversation at the consulate, they only need to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate stay there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for life in space.
The United States National Aerospace Administration (NASA) is announcing an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the convening of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present “a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life,” triggering speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments previously thought to be inhabitable, human-like creatures could exist, and it was hypothesized that they could transform into intelligent living beings – just like humans – if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all life forms imaginable because the lake is heavily arsenic-containing.
In some ways, the microbe uses arsenic as a resource for survival, and considering this ability, the odds are that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that is different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its fund at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the Organic Law on Congress would introduce the bipartisan system, they regret.
The 60th parliamentary term had just begun, and a bloc of opposition, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, had already been installed.
Before the start of the introductory session in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the Organic Law, as they would be excluded by it.
With this reform, they repeated, a ‘two-party system’ would be introduced, because now there would be two persons, the same number as parties controlling the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, Coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau headed by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political margins with these reforms.
He stated that in the coming days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, assuming their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account to take into account the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of legislative reform that Congress should have an eternal bipartisan system.”
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT pointed out in reference to PAN and PRI that Congress has currently turned into a 'prey' for two.
"In the past it was only one party, now they divide it into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MEPs and to give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of this reform, which we have agreed and agreed with the others, we have not agreed."
200,000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The city of Mazatlán is paying another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued for an amount of 200.144,56 pesos with the number 9258447 was issued on November 16 with the purpose of "accounting open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, which is monitored by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and consequently the number of checks still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Gazette, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be reused.
After the newspaper Noroeste on July 25 published the audit of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was already known that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 Palao-loss checks to Cam.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist spots need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the trade association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had a negative impact as tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't care how much money you lose, otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work this way slowly and unplanned."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How is it supposed to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy in order to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look careless and unfinished," he said, "for example, El Escudo y el Venadito de Mazatlán."
"Nowadays, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention, and these kinds of incidents represent just what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, deputy secretary of Promoción Turística, said how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to Vordermann together with the city. Designing the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive for tourism and to add them to the inventory with which we advertise for this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán is calling for a dignified parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and one of the PVEM. This makes up a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
“We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival compasses of the ruling parties and the leaders of parliamentary groups.”
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and above all, they are committed to society and their groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the great challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary importance to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget in order to support it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least funds. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign currencies and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourism projects must be funded, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not revised in previous legislatures, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Trinity Day, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes there are hard times because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go to the street with the gores to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothes in the size of a one-year-old.
“(José Alfredo) told me, ‘I would love this monster so much,’ but I said, ‘Let’s wait, boy,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah is size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the 'Holy King is Wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they reportedly served primarily in drug manufacturing.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are considered to be the main wire pullers of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The detainees appeared in front of the Sherbrooke judiciary building hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, the sale of its possessions, the conspiracy, and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that lasted for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit of the Estonian Security Police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could easily be tracked
The Conservative bill, which the government says will regulate the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, is expected to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I stand with a party that has put chains at your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session before the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a seafarer to be transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Constitution on Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also pointed out that he could not support the bill because he was turning against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
Criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, the NDP, has dismissed critics demanding her party did not behave steadfastly enough towards the clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that action should be taken against the blind passengers, and that is exactly what we are trying to enforce by means of another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks the guilt of the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are urging MPs not to tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a foothold.”
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Response Minister Kenneys.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative told the agency QMI that the government would call a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also true that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "rabbit enchanted by the hat" as well as a "solution rightly built at a table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means of forming an investigative committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of Higher Administrative Officers).
To get out of this deadlock, he proposes that Quebec grant financial audits a special mandate so that they can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and covert settlements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the examination check," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant auditing the same powers as commissioners, which would also allow it to compel people to make statements.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better attuned to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this form of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to heavy rainfall in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauritius, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation have poured into several regions.
A further 20 to 40 millimetres of rainfall was expected here by Thursday night according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais Valley region were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had descended here.
Since these precipitations include the snow melt that has already accumulated in certain sub-regions, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and the oak in Lotbinière become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rains have caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was demolished due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains alert and monitors the situation closely, said Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Centre issued warnings of the sharp rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) due to his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as his delayed speeches on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, but that certain statements have "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such unbridled speeches about the daily broadcast."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the Radio Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint from the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide more solid than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of supervisory board members had concluded that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the questionable consequences of the Dupont le midi broadcast would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not charged with any guilt towards his person.
The last point of contention was the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-intensive controversy in this regard, which has provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated to Haiti aid, since it was not certain whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unwarranted negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspension in this case."
"My file has been virginal for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unbridled form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "beyond his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, should have communicated its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now rising in search of new challenges to the tatami and to the boxing rings of the world.
“I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as kung fu and kickboxing,” Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, said in a statement.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fighting, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, working as a security official and working at UPS, he had given his rivals bad news, winning two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the Amateur World Championships held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 23 and 30 October.
“I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"It was those fighters from every category who had been placed among the top four at the last World Cup."
"I got my babe in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005, I became Achter in Vietnam."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I became third in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China where fistfights and footsteps are allowed as well as ground throws.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this type of martial art is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal keep only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pound guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Ten times in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) he had won his first fight before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals each meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a total of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to transfer its responsibility for this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" drafted the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of distortion of competition as well as price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a mapped game and it weakens the competition."
"This means that games are now being played in an open form rather than in a secret way," Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, told a news conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this in the afternoon by vehemently declaring that this contract had been a mapped game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, reaffirming that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and "lack of hardness".
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is a worldwide practice.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise in a bid to a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition having been able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quebec Business Register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of lasting duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any association, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the consortium "Energie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has turned a blind eye to the fact that the contract for project management was approved after agreement.
"If you bid and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will go up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and you say, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.'"
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reaffirmed.
This contract approved by the Energy Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Energy gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec are well known".
Minister Normandeau had accused the PQ of being equally linked to the companies they “financed” before she clarified that they were rather their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "Green" Label Is Not Trustworthy
Greener, but undeniably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little confidence in the labels or eco-labels that should govern his choice.
Too bad, although it bathes in a media-effect universe, where it is just so crowded with information in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequacy that has been shown as the first brake of its engagement, making the reader aware of how.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admit that they believe in the environmental commitment of companies as little as in green corporate advertising, according to the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer center at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be important for stimulating this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the reported performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to the barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible – the environmentally conscious consumption index had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the ride-hailing center to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallele to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallele, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex belonging to Daniel Langlois on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently did not get what they demanded.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower than the initially expected amount, which could create a viable solution under favorable conditions, at least in the opinion of sources seized from the state's rumours.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request has been revised downwards summarily since that again.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris dossier.
A few days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet's counter-proposal was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have until December 31 to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that Quebec’s community of cinema owners and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not provide any financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not allow other cinemas to come to.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
After the self-funded construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years in great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to keep its clients at bay.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are in charge of a privately funded campaign, from which they expect $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the screening of Xavier Beauvois’s very successful film “Des hommes et des dieux”.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not call off the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Secret of Complexly Shaked Canada Blown Up
The new U.S. diplomatic leadership, disseminated by WikiLeaks, unravels the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the Canadians’ inferiority complex to the Americans; but with the same blow, they reveal the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, U.S. diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind in the run-up to the election, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantive content one has to squeeze at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent inferiority complex of Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about the internal issues of everyday life than to give the United States the black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is “the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of.”
The ambassador understands this “ear-twinning silence” all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in going to the polls."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s continued viability in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, resulting from a $30-$40 billion revival program,” Breese said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the conditioned continuation of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another statement, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, makes Washington aware of the ever-negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allegations of Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or even deductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by CIA muscle prostheses can be observed.
Another report reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual "case-to-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he described, "he handed over to the Secretary of State a paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file again".
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up with respect to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper’s very close advisor, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be “killed.”
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for Renewing Lighting
The United Nations today proposed in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that must be realized to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments from industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs released to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white glowing bulbs, which so far represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the global vehicle fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global HFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from now until 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is again reduced by twice.
Compact fluorescent bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - by the way, this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-lit bulb, which is an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new types of bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistor.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the producers provide a reception point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report outlines in detail the gains that any country would make thanks to this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Expects Excited Announcement of Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"He calls on all parties and institutions of Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight to expire three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from around the world have become loud, may the CEI finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round under the resignation of Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo Camp, however, expects to cancel "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the UN’s maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had discouraged the president’s supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo counterparts, however, are now more of a view that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically close associate of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was held to crown the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% involving the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were unemployed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were able to work every two weeks or whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the 15- to 24-year-olds were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points seen over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues in this method, announcing on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, an investigation was initiated and he was imprisoned in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with corruption, misappropriation of public property, harassment, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, rather than spreading brainstorming."
"It's easy to put a number of criminal charges before him, but it's another thing to prove," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the department, had insisted on sending a memorandum to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers.
A Guérinis relative, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
With regard to the business area or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Municipality of Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday with bribery and complicity, but then under the condition to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations on the facts that were accused him."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were indicted and released from detention on Tuesday night, including two under legal supervision, according to deputy chief prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of the municipality of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title "Evasion and misappropriation of general property by a public service official", the other because of "interference in misappropriation of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's life partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "healing and subjugating social assets".
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar case of public fraud that had affected Corsica.
The hunters suspect his company of helping to launder money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, here in particular in the disposal branch, will be conducted in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the addition and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille Urban Reservoir (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediation function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "spying" the French public, put diplomacy on the alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Paris.
All this under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostage taking” in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man imprisoned in France and sought by the US justice on the basis of trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media in order to make this idea credible, the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a grim light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Comments on the Way of Handling Hostage Takings".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who would be held forcibly in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without omission" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do it."
Because "silence solves nothing", past the attempts to discuss indiscriminately, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "the taking of hostages for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on August 16, the day she flees to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro bail).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that will "intensify itself".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is demanded by the United States due to illegal trade in sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from detention following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "stricter" supervision of French intelligence.
The Elysée adviser selects a telephone number, re-imposes it, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
While in custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not spared its efforts to persuade, through statements and media-organized “escape attempts,” Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to play an “important” and “influential mediator role.”
Americans do not observe this activity without irony, stating that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009, invokes "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much “thank you” to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy asks itself.
“Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 was then "perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"Building up the Syrian role" Paris "trys to lead Syria in the face of what rewards can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It also aims to “seed discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told her: “Of course we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them after all."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favor of the release of our compatriots.”
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is passing a law called "the Cinderella," which will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill to urge online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of culture and family ministries said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial official entrusted with this bill from the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
Manufacturers would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also intends to ask manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intense Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
FIFA World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
In light of suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday named the World Cup 2018 and 2022 host countries, a highly political election in which ranks for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional fortress (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then turn out to be a bit more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to pursue its office in the United States or in Farnost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the extent of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the election.
With the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, the Sunday Times could have just as well ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which could only endure the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had revived it on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report targeting three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials who had been lobbying intensely with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a reissue of the chess move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-evaluate England’s image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumpets with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the files (stages, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the indiscriminate allegations of the English press "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
“You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favourites.
First economic world power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s long-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will put an end to Asian opportunities by 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the records with the emergence of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift) acquitted by the European countries, FIFA’s sensitive nerve.
The Second Mandate: Clarity
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand had made him think he was a fool.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But clarity does not face the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac argued that a third term could not be ruled out without even believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011".
Accordingly, the fact that he would call the prospect of "two mandates" in front of the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in the Elysée had spread a bit of fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from missing.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone on the occasion of such meetings.
“You have at least seven and a half years with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a New in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase afterwards."
His words of the day before do not make him any more a candidate than the day before; but no less.
If they make comments, then for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are admonishing earlier than assumed to fight.
The bad surveys on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to a poll by the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," the prime minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has agreed with the clarity.
Euro: ECB is forced to retain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the imposition of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt can no doubt not afford to affect the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, so as not to provoke their aggravation.
The political cost would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s national debt at a press conference yesterday.
She has not dared to say whether she believes the central bank could do even more, for example by stimulating its program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, said on the eve of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee in Brussels that he did not speak very well about his projects, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government bonds would be "together with the decision of the market in secondary bonds"
The ECB will keep its interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest ever since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled bond purchases of the Treasury last week to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, yesterday she reportedly made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is in no way questioned (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
If bond pending transactions of more than three months will have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be able to make use of the unrestricted money reserves in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already assuming that this measure will extend for a few more months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a significant way."
"Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, the ECB "should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that revives the sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"She must step into the shoes of the missing investors in the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," a major bondholder testified yesterday.
For if the interest rates start to rise, states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even just stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
Berlusconi's government in Italy
After a disturbing start to the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed a bit yesterday with the fall in corner rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the President of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and expected him to hear a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the scissors with German interest rates would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out in his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "heavy concern" about the "market turmoil" and a possible contagion threat from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, addictive tax revenues that put the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available to the Senate for review is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to government forecasts of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Therefore, also the upheaval around a new budget collective, which could be deployed after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is in charge of the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) requires less stabilisation progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the anticipated elections could be organized already at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
At a press conference in Paris, Lagarde said: “I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although completely relative, the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European sovereign bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about a normalization beginning.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, "political time is passing much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, who are well aware of both this gap and the dangers it entails, are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and in the wider sense with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the countries of the eurozone in the intersection of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first investment paper expenditures from the EU Stability Fund are planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. official told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the IMF’s additional, direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are in their turn on the verge of adopting structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms, in addition to austerity measures, should have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other lie in avoiding having to ask for international assistance at all costs before setting up their own budgetary corrections and deciding on unavoidable structural reforms that will restore their trust in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way to Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised through Europe and the International Monetary Fund weren’t enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, consider that an extension of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This fund exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being scrutinized in the European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions are worsening.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Alarmstufe Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Alarmstufe Orange due to the imminent snow and smooth ice risk.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already in alert stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments snow blankets are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic jams and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who avoid using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "exhorts motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris' Roissy airport and 10% of their flights from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London, as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital grant of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount that would then allow the SGP to lend a portion of the financial amount on the markets to double it.
Today, we finally have the first highscores.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this funding.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on the opening and opening of offices and a higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de-France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a reorganisation of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to give this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not encoded in the text.
Of the $4 billion, it is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation, which will be raised by the state and gradually made available to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
In the SGP, this system is not at all offensive.
"From the moment you account for income (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection over three years and then only get out of the 4 billion," the statement said.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which the four billions promised will be long to be sought, runs the risk of triggering a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revengeful hackers and sneaky spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the spirit of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it is announcing profound changes at the international level, giving a glimpse of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (an x-believing nation) consists exclusively of newspaper snippets.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits dismiss nothing more than what was read in every x-believing journal anyway over the months (except for those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terribly caricatured profile of Gaddafi's already caricatured sebaeret.
The rule that secret files can only consist of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rose-Croix) repeats exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (although he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s mechanism of success.
As well as the secrets.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is also the head of the intelligence (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, an editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi, which the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Decree, was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such an overhaul made of the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then even the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representational tasks, have lost their roles.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it’s not out of hypocrisy that you do this to ignore it.
Nonetheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an X-like hacker can uncover the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Dezernat.
In addition, the scandal puts the victims less in distress than the “sharkers”.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the deep nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where one can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one keeps in mind what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the process of control ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the avenger of the citizen -, can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold on?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, as it means the public sphere of secrets, but Clinton reveals the secrets of secrets in the Wiki.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future – that would be like a hanging out on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is in vain with the current technologies to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret via phone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a head of state moved on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and specific relationships be maintained for certain ears in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and novel, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents moving secretly obsessively on uncontrollable marches, their messages carrying nowhere else than in mere memory, and besides having the information carried along with them.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate’s spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing like a cancer these days, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to explore a film tape by spooling from back to front and exposing all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro-proportions.
The high-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Speaks Beautifully of its Financial Promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the swiftly-resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or "early funding") made by developing countries.
And already the coarse French beauty shops have been uncovered.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, while France has pledged 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report from their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its real value: developing countries and civil society would love to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which puts it on the right path to respecting its commitment of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But if you look into the details, things are a bit more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without going to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the right value they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for 2009: international funding will be retained, and will provide 150 million for three years of "fast start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guideline values, either for the year or for conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In return, France considered the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed as equivalent to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission mitigation projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is taken as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan should be taken as the equivalent of the capital.
But France has nothing other in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their commitments 100% with donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfil its obligations, France is only giving 10 cents and understands a similar commitment.
Nice hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double gossip: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (since Bercy seems to have carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other member states continue to lend, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not allow themselves to fully...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the totality of climate discussions.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this is not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its accounting system for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could bring forward discussions about the subject matter of long-term financing (another issue that is crucial and currently being discussed): one does not escape the question of "accountability" or the type of bookkeeping of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive on the issues of contention as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “liability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals over the course of a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analyzed do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustrative character of the problem treated," had between July and September the food usually consumed within four, from a roughly ten-year-old child to the meals plus a meal in Paris and a meal in the super meal.
These typical meals—including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit portions, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water per day—were investigated as well as nasheries by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The plate balance is depressing: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruption factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if in the approximate totality of cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded, it is very well inferred from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine inclusion is exposed to the disturbing factor", the authors conclude.
Already at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three that have been proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, for which the study found traces of a strictly banned insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spiked.
In the tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "most abundant", and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unburdened.
The ultimate risk of this “polluting cocktail” to the consumer “is likely to be underestimated,” the study said.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "growing of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
