The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Olds for Fast Motorcycle Hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before fleeing into the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the driver's description were later seen at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop sign and reckless driving.
He will appear before the Karratha District Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man faces trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, read the indictment at a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The indictment states that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Reflections on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
“As unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Employee Entitlement Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of trade union organization as it does for other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the national labour law to create an opportunity for discriminatory workers to organize a trade union representation, to sue before a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks to which unions have been exposed in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to unite in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions had a role to play in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise themselves, and should raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every guaranteed profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict or restrict this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to join or form trade unions to protect them."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As this country advises other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to form a union – and to have that union participate in collective bargaining as equal partners with companies and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights have been under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but rather enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for industry and elevated the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge Temporarily Stops Law That Could Force All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana to Close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would likely have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was enacted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admissions right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions temporarily while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while striving to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be set up for the judge to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying doctors were thus gaining more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are evading a fraudulent law that wants to take away their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the suit and also applied for inclusion rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key areas of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostertricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Opponents of abortion oppose the idea that the measures are designed to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the impact of the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient access rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient enrollment rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research lead Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing pre-existing diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers are possible factors for this.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter the distances, as a possible remedy, she proposed a strengthening of the service of incoming doctors to allow specialists to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographic status, revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, coupled with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, reach the “Garden Products Core Group,” reports the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for park purposes, and the declining size of the garden are other factors threatening the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put on sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a 6-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting homes or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said, "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed state-run PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, about 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away, they provided themselves with sticks and stones equipped with clashes with security forces.
The police fired tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif’s resignation, but Sharif refused.
The country’s army, meanwhile, urges for a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without using violence”.
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already swept more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in parliamentary elections last May.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to break into Sharif’s residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey Appoints US Diplomat for Spying Report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has recruited the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats to investigate a report of U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US embassy’s spokesman and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that that of former US analyst at the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, shows that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that even Germany’s most important intelligence service was targeting Ankara caused much more outrageous reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The standoff announced for 18 to 21 hours affects all transport companies throughout the Federal Republic, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

Sven Schmitte, the district chairman of the German Locomotive Leaders (GDL), said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant downtimes.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where it wants to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf charged with corruption
Prosecutors on Friday presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the prosecutor’s office of Mallorca.
The head of Calvià’s police on Mallorca’s holiday island was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been detained on corruption charges by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors on Friday presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for combating corruption in Mallorca.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the annoyed nightclub owners said the authorities' cousin economy had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Let's get our livelihood out of the way.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer based on a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing Fellatio on 24 men during a sampling tour.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the misconduct of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcoholic pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and club tour organizer Carnage jointly had to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, popular especially with young British tourists, is also known for numerous alcohol-induced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide airport
The MORNING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with fierce thunderstorms and strong winds that have affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy sightings, including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and caused nearly 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a peak of only 15.8°C.
The awkward weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shearing wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to launch through.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off during a second landing and finally set off at about 8:40 p.m.
The flight delay subsequently resulted in some other flights being delayed, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
In Adelaide, the maximum temperature is 16°C on Tuesday, with high chances of thunderstorms.
Matthies says: It's high time for great networking
In the face of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switchboards, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind it: if the cable were not there, in a short time all the listeners would fly around the house without a master, and that would be significantly more retro.
In other words, the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing errors: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And those who, for example, still have a tube TV in the living room today, simply say that they refuse TV in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pushing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week brings us back to our absolute incompetence in electronics matters.
The layman, who used to blindly control the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being distributed with an unbelievably elusive expert talk in front of him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should you talk about with people who seem to be willing to spread such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about connecting our house.
So that the yogurt will reorder itself, so that the fire detector will tell us during the holidays in the Maldives that it is burning in the workroom.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our early arrival...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioner.
But a dream is sure to come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, say to her loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum robot goes off.
It's crazy.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blur", argues an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headset, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but what does not help us in .
We also know from everyday practice that when a new fashionable device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exposures.
Israeli Children Return to Schools After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air defense spaces, while rocket and mortar fire at their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed.
Starting school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the rocket-propelled communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed grenades from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza to safer areas and avoid rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza that is heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s air and sea ports.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades at Israeli cities during the fighting, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, the educational authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After elections in Saxony: CDU-Visa Strobl questions NPD-prohibited procedure
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU federal vice-president Thomas Strobl has appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure.
According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is doing worse than it did last time," Strobl, who is also the CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed at the five-percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.
A first call for a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003, because constitutional protection at the time also had informants at the top of the NPD.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
On Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central First Admission for Refugees in Harburg explodes from all sides.
Now the Interior Ministry has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to them.
The district politicians were informed only shortly beforehand - they are not enthusiastic.
"These hauruck actions continue to stir the citizens' reservations and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to contribute constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chair of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg district administration provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first admission are the influx of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough space in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-split market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have risen by only 1.4% over the year.
Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in real estate for sale for the next few months, which would undergo the market "a real test".
“Considering the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate, and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests to his pose "like a fielder".
This is not the style of the university, it says in the statement.
For example, the Medau family had already been verbally informed about the establishment of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong,” Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "predeterminations or even decisions", but there would be "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, necessary for access, was also less dramatic than feared by the Medusas.
There was and is not a question of a nine-meter-wide street.
According to the current state, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Trains are not parked at all, because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the locals
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and in front of which the access to the parking deck would lead, according to the university president, "is not to be affected".
Rather, he points out that "it is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the mouth of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring realschool.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of the men of Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parenting Council of the Kinderkrippe, with the expansion of the road would be justified one "of the few naturalized spots of Coburg" to be lost, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Construction Office, wants to inform the city councils about the development of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau last week informed the parents of the crib about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access to the new parking deck should not be via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, as before, but via the Medau-Berg.
To do this, the narrow road would have to be extended to about a kilometre in two tracks.
According to calculations of the Medusa, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would be tenfold.
We are talking about about 2,000 vehicles a day.
So far, the city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited mainly health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus retires with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will inspire my long-time teammates and my successors.
But for my club I want to be available healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear the end of his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) treat him with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the confrontation ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go unnoticed.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure properly under control.
To this are added some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I can control my head, but I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview.
For a comeback, he would be ready only in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings are torn, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least a bit.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League victory, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup of Cup winners with Flensburg.
The German economy shrank by 0.2% in the spring
Crises around the world slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and provisional calculations were confirmed.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong year-on-year start, the first half of the year saw a GDP increase of 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "fietsenfahrer".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the biggest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to those interested in various magazines.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way as well," the cyclists were delighted about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the clubhouse of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
Furthermore, the route, which was tendered for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On tracks of 95 kilometers with 1,175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1,475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1,175 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Deputy Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a great experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing concludes positively.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped,which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see you in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised, but still promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's Relentlessly Honest Memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monk and Warrior" on paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought-feelings for thought-feelings, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching song lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from masturbation as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Broad space also takes up abstract but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the Now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was not only influenced by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the liverman Konstantin Waker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting all unnecessary things".
Among all the high-spirited views, however, there are also brief anecdotes about the earth: for example, about fighting in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he frontally targeted a tree.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: "Stop the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who were grown up when I was a child – went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than in his father's days, he still gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It’s a little lighter now, but they’re dark, smoked, deep stygious mazes with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he could wash the casting off of himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother was ill at the end of her life that we began to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me! Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I pulled this fitness thing through and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may show itself in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been inducted into the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of the Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager held the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don’t regret it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-old award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What do you do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking the time or stepping in a little bit?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was very allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school, and I mostly thought of him as a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front of him.
So I was terrified of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it.
Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words into your mouth, and then you’ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello’s final speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally set my head right.
“It’s about it, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, 'You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the stage director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked out of the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
That too came along well, so it’s like a big shield of the gods telling me, “This is your destiny.”
He says this, of course, with a WONDERFUL voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is filled with humorous outbursts while he keeps imitating people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I want to, but overall I don’t get as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of a journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give that up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party, Ansar Allah, said.
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for measures on Sunday evening.
Houthi threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met, according to the leaflet.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-run Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding countryside, there are bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "spirit workers"
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove "spirit workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
In an audit earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month in payments were lost to “spirit workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure their biometric records are recorded, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the statement said.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'spirit employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-founder Theo Albrecht, claim <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, who are insolvent.
A spokeswoman for the court said on Monday.
The plaintiff said that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht had calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He served in school for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many professed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his endeavor to see people in the student.
The snowshoe is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already at the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight wagon.
So Judge swallowed it into the Upper Franconian village of Senken.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to run six times a week for ten kilometers to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to the school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years, the second state examination.
Since Frank had no free teaching post for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and went to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Mrs. Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the elementary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter’s retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who built a workshop additionally at municipal expenses and, at the 1997 expansion, had basements built, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture of a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work." Whether he meant just his students or his own six children, it's not entirely clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat each other, they did not get a penalty job from him, nor were they condemned to sit back.
At the expense of the community, the judge had two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a veil.
For the good of the school, judges as rectors had a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the impartial judge to run for the council in 1996, at least as the last candidate on the CSU list.
However, Judge was selected for sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
However, on Friday alone, the number of resting guests was impressive: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour, along with their companions, enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first leg, 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen’s own business, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, zwetschen, streusel and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised as he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnasium.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already fastened off bicycle chains again today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the well in front of the drinking cure house and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also promotional director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 cycling tour 2004 as a tour guide, could only sneeze briefly, but he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the Hesse Police via three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In Category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they started out again after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the bikers were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course, there were delicacies prepared, such as flamingo cake with well-cooled feather white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a member of the ADAC Hesse-Thüringen board welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently delighted with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move swingingly under the open sky was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were as fond of the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalden - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes again arrived in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiring" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiring against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not make any immediate comment.
Among the detainees are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly forming an organized criminal association and seizing phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Gülen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told awaiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksandr Pastukov, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Jazenjuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful for them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud sleigh of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own frontier experience.
She started her career at Bain and Co., a global management consulting firm, and then moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the Pearsons media world.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the senior position of Pearson’s parent company went to a younger male colleague.
His bail allegedly amounted to nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, as he sought more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory member of the council.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust acts in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopole that demands a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what new president would take the risk of attacking everything and dismantling an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps caring about his own job?
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money and status obsolete.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of licence fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 per year, the British public buys into the surely largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households, each costing only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone nowadays and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a significant chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry of Texas Says Decreasing Tweet Was Not Authorized
A tweet from Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry’s official user account on Sunday included a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perrys user account, renouncing the previous one.
I just received a tweet from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and have deleted it,” it said in the later message.
Perry staff did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out of Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial promotion of her office when she refused to step down, leading to an indictment against Perry — who could possibly be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible level of alcohol ... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury’s investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of attorneys applied to the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law proceeding against the oldest serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds from the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa election assemblies during his 2012 presidential run, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley says housing market is 'normal' again
One of London's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeast England has returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England, due to widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley said on Monday, “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak,” adding that this offers a “stable environment of action.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers rushed into the capital.
According to the Catastrophe Office, prices in the urban area jumped by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average sales prices for Berkeley’s private, inexpensive, and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villa tax" before the general elections in May.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending rules, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage licensing in July, which also suggests the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for future sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, futures sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year through the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent annually to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million, and revenue by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Pidgley said revenues for Berkeley this year were expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit at <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Oscars.
Oscar-winning nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine, accusing the hacker of "blatant breach of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan, were allegedly acquired by a loophole in Apple’s iCloud online storage system. The alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth BudasheedF Ozzad and Mary.
It’s not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the rest of the world” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private setting of our house - I hope you are as truly satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are LOVE, folks.
Let's go back to the beginning. *Word play intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande is waiving the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They broke apart, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distanced, and maybe a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
Scratch-brush he knew.
He was stingy, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was an affair just beginning, which had been more promising for the relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an elderly companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradise valley with the matching name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snails had left their marks on all the windows and believed that they owned it all, and the garden was covered with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailin hand in hand on the broken chairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of whom had clinked into the service console, which had provided the country with calming music and reassuring news.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what enactments and regulations would never have achieved, and just as people choose books for their memoirs, cookbooks, and love novels, they chose ballads for their music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Ailinn’s big feet in a roughly comic serenade.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn’t been a very funny game back then, and it wasn’t very funny now either.
He knew what was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of one before.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only one “when” in my life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The mind as well.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of that society agreed gratefully to the principle of group gifting – gratefully as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN HAS HAPPENED, WHEN HAS HAPPENED, for fear of being accused of fire extinguishers, even for fear that the flames would consume them next, he had behaved with the unshaven and shining press.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be missed.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailin still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in their presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing else to see in the whole world but your uncombed black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see.
"When you say it," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too big?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm one needed to grasp the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got up from her deckchair, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like a palm wedge in a storm.
“And your dickhead is exactly the reason I feel pervertedly drawn to you,” she said.
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more deplorable after what had happened when their ancestors were smugglers and beach robbers, moved from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or mocked them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she hadn't been careful!
They just knock - knocking was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the nonsensical love ballads from the console - knocking them first and then beating them.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the pounding itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to pass through her body.
He stood up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt the flushing, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him move away—just as her companion watched him from a room on the top floor—a man complaining about something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit – why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at the low and middle level, not being considered in exactly the parts of the country.
"A lot has already been done, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been cherished amongst the high-demanding kir.
But some characteristics turn out to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps at the playground listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicated with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former roughness holds the rural communities as well as our urban fabrics firmly in the hand, but there are also houses for the new ones to be born, and there is also streaking on the new ones.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nut Tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and the refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I do not ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a non-judgmental workplace.
We serve a non-prejudice society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things you call "cruel" and "cruel" could equally well be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
To go on about what happens when it happens, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened, means to take away from the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED sign in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter-century or longer.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of it," answered Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effectively healed as we pretend ourselves to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened when it happened at all.
This time, however, it is not the others that we omit our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
This is an example of English patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you refer to acts as "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about leaving out their “anger” and their “suspicion” of “others.”
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as well as protecting the present, we are talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there was no “others.”
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From that, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened is what happened.
That was the time.
There is no need to say anything more about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt needs to be assigned, no guilt needs to be repaid, if such repaint is appropriate and if there is a way to repaid it.
But what good is the past if we don't learn from it?
The past is meant to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can say -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as passersby described, had been riding on the sidewalk in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military Member Says No Coup Is Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were taking action against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, announcing that the country’s army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose armed forces were imminent.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defence Forces staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements acting within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a coup.
"Even though no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defense Forces so far show signs of a coup d'état," he said.
On Sunday, military spokesmen from Lesotho said the troops were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been high tensions since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unitary government.
He said his actions would not have undermined the government, despite different accusations.
Eurozone production at 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give further information this week on whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, similar to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the dampening effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent to manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months, at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a concern, as is Italy’s descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism no longer reach Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also not reassuring,” Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely fueling the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone from August is that after that the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – are aggravating uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be “increasingly likely” that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a kind of QE, “although we suspect this will be limited.”
The Hell's Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children trapped in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom during the atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future amidst the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom during the atrocities.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now beating Ukraine - and in which children like them die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the school sports hall shot
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famously tried to climb back into the school sports hall in her underwear only after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were filled with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she felt completely healed, but said yesterday: “Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have surgery again.
Some grenade splinters are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she has been helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember the ones who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I’ll think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory gets a little weaker each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help prevent something like this from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear that she might be dead, he ran and saw a weeping infant on the way, grabbed it by the hand and ran through a bullet hail.
His father Vladimir, who held his son in arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and suffered leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will fade in my memory.
I remember throwing all my toy guns away right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard and who didn’t make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those suffering from the atrocities," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want so much to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borshch and called them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch sometimes, turning his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, and saw the hell all around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn’t have survived in this hell.
“I remember whispering to him, ‘Damir, run, run away’, but I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And this is how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
George Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she rushed off to take her elder son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was an entire family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always haunt me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
Urgent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgiy wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies over and over again and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is turning into something terrible.
“I can’t understand how that’s possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Wladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Faniev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgi Faniev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle that he was not killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and after that I actually felt a little better, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I've lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I've been in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about it and of course they should not suffer from it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I will go to the memorials.
I know George won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help it.
I am so thankful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is drawn of it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run, but he can’t do any sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many of my friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, which only intensified my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more are being killed.
If only we could grab and expel all these rebels – as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so grippingly carried safely by a Special Operations Command
Rescued: Aljona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of overtaking girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man faces trial for crossing a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment alleges that Mr. Steward drove his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denies the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC initiated the trial for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Inspect your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed tight.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for dazzling underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, Action Cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So make a lot of footage.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse as you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
This is especially important when working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they are meant to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving patients from both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about diagnoses and diseases, while those treated are mostly busy with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time catching up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently blamed his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it now than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray examination of his chest.
He had only been skiing in the French Alps two weeks ago.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the skin of the breast, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance", but has now been identified as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be easily ignored.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged not to use it anymore.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be hardly a concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all types of asbestos have been banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and still is, often present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no safe haven.
Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healed, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as a starting stove.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
“Of the four doctors trained at Guy’s Hospital and who have suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years,” he wrote in a letter in 2010, “I am the last one still alive.”
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
Therefore, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
Professor Julian Peto, Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, believes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to subside, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the court records, to which the victims often turn because of claims for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioma has already been.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would ever affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestosform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a "high health risk" with a potential for death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment at work or at home."
Most of these contacts, he says, are based on the “normal use and aging” of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the management of the West Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of labor over several years must be put in place to renovate the Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos from the centre where it is located in 2015.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the data.
What he still remembers exactly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and was undergoing surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt awful.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and put on pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health was slowly improving, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms came into his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not relate this to his own case.
Eventually, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt sick, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cave between the ribs and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (like Graham Abbott often did) were more likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our homes as floor slabs or shed roofs contain asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in much of our properties,” noted Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that came to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you rip off your garden shed.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to record all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How long do I have?'
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the skin of the breast and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the skin of the chest," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow affected people.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he introduced himself cheerfully when calling.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiac thoracic specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in not having to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best therapies available.
But if these treatments eventually inevitably fail, many affected are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that we realized that even a very low load posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation" as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove a contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” of the insurance industry.
“This is a deal from insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone by and mesothelioma sufferers would find the companies and be able to sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths a day, rapid action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After his first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," Abbott says.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There is something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
There is no trace of tumors anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things – about the money when I’m no longer there, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I would not grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more cautious.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trail of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite increasing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows communist leaders in principle to reject all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s legal expert.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said admitting public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain regained control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the residents elect the presidency as of 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the run-up through a closely controlled nomination committee from Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s largest and most publicly effective protests have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the central district as a last resort, an action that should take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exploited and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for Beijing’s announcement, and tightened security measures including police forces and barricades were in place in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is heightened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The attraction of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values of democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as endangering Hong Kong's business operations.
"The protests they are talking about could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote, in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the US is now being passed on to the universities where freshmen are offered performances by private jet.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to crawl their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings yet as the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the coming weeks.”
The company also announced that it expects a market for this offer despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as cancelled.
Megan Dunn, vice president of NUS for higher education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are exposed to a crisis of living expenses as the available financial grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest basics of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student's home.
Feminists Criticize Racial Question and Police Behavior, According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Midwest rose and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to black women’s responses shortly after the August 9 shootings, personal essays with titles such as “Thoughts about Ferguson from a White Woman” and “Feminism doesn’t just revolve around the oppression of women” came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find a lot of people in feminism who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson uncovered problems to which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how black people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship but not about security in public spaces?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now linking race and gender issues in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women fighters like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the suffrage for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist responses to the questions posed by Ferguson – police behavior, racial discrimination – is a mirror of the time when white feminists “catch” the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception control?"
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are clearly different in public polls - will lead to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism that addresses racial as well as gender issues, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “Who Stole Feminism?” told She The People that young men in the United States, particularly young colored men, “are far more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks on Ferguson contradict her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently put in place a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to rethink the issue as an essential women’s theme, she only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a resonance in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included an image of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had bent his head on a sofa.
Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"The photo was erroneously published and has now been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the House's exposition, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family house."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of houses sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is coming this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey won the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profits provide conversational material in the small town southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners celebrated first division wins last month, a fitting conclusion for a few lucky weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made a mega profit of $7.5 million just weeks before.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win would allow them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas beats in the gladiator arena
It was not only the gladiators who stood in the match at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were left to be thrilled with the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of performances, plays, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat force of the "Amor Mortis" gladiator school, which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men in succession to the ring for the heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocators" were in line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and wreath, as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who with a throwing net, a trident and a dagger attacked the "Secutor" and, after a short fight, knocked the boy to the ground.
Since the swords were metallic to each other, the shields formed and the sparrows flew rushing through the arena that could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye to it.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era a reality," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city for a day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of it were also to be admired during the Roman day, for example "aqueduct-marble" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time."
This is also confirmed by graduate measurement engineer Ralph Heiligen of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894, as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm-air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Impressive also are the footprints left by wolves and foxes two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before burning them.
In 2011, the Office for the Care of Landmarks at the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of a commercial building with a dart for drying grain and grinding have been found.
The building probably belonged to a villa rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also engaged in the Roman windmill play, similar to today’s windmill play, or they wrote their names on waxboards, as the Roman students used to do.
At the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the booth of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach they made glass mosaics and at the booth of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center they used a heavy stone wheat mill to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the original Roman touring car faithfully rebuilt by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive state of the City High School, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman Week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman Year 2014 proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, they will offer themed walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes, as well as a reminder of Wachtberg’s Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell about his work on the Moorish Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era and offer a funny lesson on peoples' understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and exiled Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be revived.
In the Wachtberg Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is affecting West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are obsolete – and international companies are going to distance themselves.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is giving West Africa’s economy a severe blow.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are wasted - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing at the second-largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people suffering from the fever alone.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands more became infected.
Foreign firms withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are shutting down their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are taking off their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: Only a few merchants still leave their hometowns to source supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia that are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay home.
The population is therefore getting to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, stocks of basic foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is at risk of imaging damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What matters is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression “that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the tightened state budgets of the states
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody’s fears that their budgets will be severely strained by high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
However, the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau Schützenverein celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, the Tannenwald Schützenverein is preparing for the 50th anniversary of the founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12th, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., there will be a big bullet shooting.
Then in the large party tent is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big feast at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the prize distribution of the federal and Gauss shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 party ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the Association for "Social Entertainment by Exercise in Room Stunt and Small Caliber Shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April in the inn Lukas lifted the "new" archer's club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult initial period, when it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting facility.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club’s record was set every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, so have the membership numbers.
After the clubhouse "Leininger" no longer met the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on 8 May 1988, Pastor Strasser granted the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new sniper flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
During many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association last year modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof, thus bringing the latest technology to life.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Shooting Club.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as goat stings, faschings and king ball, club trip and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the feasts in the parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart Suffers Accident When He Returns To The Racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended roughly halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst into round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart had driven into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I entered today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tow truck and the team had packed and was ready to go.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash track race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has been made as to whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start to 12th position, Stewart had already made his way into the top 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs got hit
Car with No. 18 out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Looking for a young dancer
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and lead Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to teammates.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn can also create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now young people are increasingly looking for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you are interested in dancing on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6:30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, you can join the training class without any obligation.
“The training regularly starts with a warm-up program,” the trainer says.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, socializing is also not too short.
"We also go out to dinner, watch dance movies and we've also spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motor development.
Anyone who does not like jazz dance can also sneak into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always take part in the classes on Wednesdays in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Mondays and Wednesdays.
If you like discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher wages are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are on the rise.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly also involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel high-rise Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter jet and two military helicopters, according to their own depiction.
Around 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sank two Ukrainian coast guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were shot down near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk today meets the Ukraine contact group.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all the actors used their appearances to make their claim public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a sharp breach" of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that "they regard us as opponents".
Strengthening NATO's presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A Readiness Action Plan to be finalized at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute, according to official sources.
Negotiations are set for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supplies to Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says toll will come "clearly"
The Chancellor is once again clear about this.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CDU’s obstinate concerns about the toll on cars have angered the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out after persistent resistance from her CDU a power order for the introduction of a car toll.
"To be clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel has not been able to find a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being worked on".
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to a toll equal on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report unanswered on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to reward highway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed that it would cover all county and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU head of state.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak once again on the subject.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU-Länderverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition allegiance from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is due to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners are not allowed to be charged additionally under the Coalition Agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, according to EU law, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe walk, and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will get worse over time, as well as the symptoms of the disease.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I kept falling, and it took me longer.
I was never able to ride skates or skateboards with the other children and was often infuriated at school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said she saw her medical records at the age of 13 after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I got a response, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my skills.
I made up all this with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities hadn’t diminished as much as she had imagined and interviewed her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "Honey, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, it was detected at her CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop training ground
For nearly ten years, no more gunfire has been fired at the former troop training ground in Münsingen.
Yet every month, deadly ammunition still appears in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang sounds in the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsinger Truppenübungsplatz, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6,500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District area, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company’s state and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining modesty in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose by 4.3 percent more than local taxes, according to a study conducted by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenues from companies with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in companies’ real estate values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of this profit came from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the run-up seems to also apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012, an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes account for just over a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of the property, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by nonprofit organizations that don’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise evenly in all three locations.
The growth rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
With 6%, Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rates in all three offices (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and relatively high 9.975 percent in the district.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia requires lower state and local corporate taxes and a better tax climate overall than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen – a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized – in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general excise tax revenues for the state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Still, the space could lag behind Washington if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city,” said Li Yiwei, deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, visiting a SPD delegation in his city this week.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolises in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would consult with a potential partner for the project in Germany.
"Beer doesn't need much: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party worker in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou attacked with a shepherd's turtle - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity commandment.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Deputy Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician said.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to increase".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the foreground of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Managed partnership
The deputy party chief from Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not yet in this function.
He only took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The move against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption that is being vigorously enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000-kilometer-long Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic strength as all of Hesse.
Next year, it aims to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li said.
Joan Rivers' family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter showed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're all squeezing our thumbs.
Her mother was reportedly admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that will be commercially available from now on.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1, on which the buyer can at a glance identify key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars in the pollutant class "Euro 6" stricter nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon Acquires Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer — and video producer, and a host of other things — is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it seemed like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion-dollar thing decided, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravura in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which knowledgeable people give the (mostly older) games a touch of science theater, is already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was a bit boring, a textbook example of an established technology company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t happen, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking control of the control console yourself.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watching a spinner shoot him in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all of these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the eye perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it’s not a game or humorous hobby, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
What do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube Twitch could have easily swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
The entrance had to be stopped temporarily.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt Weddle l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in Salzwedel Castle Garden is supposed to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was shown in the early Sunday evening, when the first visitors opened up for the open air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedelers, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They watched the first live performances, waved their foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were fashionable.
And that’s across generations.
While some were lumped on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others were drunk on a quarter of a wine in the winery, the youngster was lumped on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in children’s makeup, the volunteers, in the truest sense of the word, had all their hands full to become masters of the andrang and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salt Weddle.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m. he rushed down to the visitors, especially families were looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not disappoint.
“There were more people coming than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success on the whole line.”
Therefore, there is nothing against a repeat of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, in a first balance sheet on Sunday, Sem made it clear to the popular vote.
Annoying, he said, the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox interrupted their performance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salt Weddle because of a tyre pan.
"Next year, they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be forgiven the first time, but need to be eliminated in the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to include criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a bit," Ele Zimmermann says in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as close.
I think it’s very good that some people not only gossip stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!", Stephanie Jenß writes to the amulet.
Now the organizers have a year to postpone these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made component awaits to be used in the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
If the weather plays a role, the action should go over the stage earlier this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge slits her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so loudly when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went awry.
A woman was taken to the hospital after screaming so loudly at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she shrugged her jaw off.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stood still,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn’t work, the jaw was hooked, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it too and almost got in their pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to have her jaw curbed again after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereins soon be pulling back on a strand?
Lastly, there was always a quarrel between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereins.
Now the boards are thinking about a possible collaboration.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks on a joint approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the club board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," Sjöberg says.
In his view, all members of both clubs could in the future pull back on the same strand.
Thus, visible successes can be recorded more quickly.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until recently in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the Burgverein um Sjöberg the "enclosure and experience" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in front of the Castle Friends.
A new chairman is due to be found at a member's meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thought" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to talks with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also create an up-to-date mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to "but very much to continue working on the project".
In Piffl’s eyes, the different views on reconstruction will probably persist in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first, too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward. It could be a "all-in-one feature" for the Flösserstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may move a bit at this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story "is important and good".
After that you could see further.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, fast-paced second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever spar idea.
He invented a lending system for books from students of higher semester and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there would be various cost mitigation options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, said renting of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookshops were rented last spring semester, Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookshops, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price they are to have in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t care about other people’s notes or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if earlier editions were permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expense.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them, and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business at which you rent, including the penalties that may apply for writing notes, underscores or traces of use.
Pay attention: If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $ 61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics these days can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Anyway, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Didn't Become a Cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" recorded less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-tailored film "Sex Tape" only grossed $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon's Tale Easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Dragon's Tale Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, in the case of films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film launch that was shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming jungle book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as in the previous year, when revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic book filming and prophesied a Hollywood “melting-in.”
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted a few years ago in order to tighten the league classification, it was a step in the right direction.
The German Table Tennis Federation has now added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the drop, but will only play fifth class in the coming season.
Fourth-class Torpedoes remain ladies, despite their grandiose entry into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve join the new association league, in which the Göttingen clubs are no longer represented.
For the women, TTV Geismar plays in the association league, the torpedo second in the national league.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district Oberliga Süd.
Here TSV Seoulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete.
As regional representatives, Dransfeld and SC Weende play in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here from the match.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With each nine teams
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly formed regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisliga start with nine teams each.
In the western season are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Ost-Staffel play among others Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Women's Circle League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seouling II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no more women’s teams at the circle level.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd class circles reaches the target strength, here the innovative and perverted circle board will have to think.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in central Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us over the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teens flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bush hikers were brought to safety by rope after being trapped in the Blue Mountains in NSW overnight.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two did not return home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured herself on her knee and the man had fallen and slammed his head open.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were deployed on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The nearly 1,000 protesters were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The transmitter has resumed broadcasting after more than half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the stick-equipped protesters had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that there were again clashes of about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured on the weekend when protesters tried to break into Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday night, after a meeting at the army headquarters, for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using violence".
The statement said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has fueled concern about a military intervention that has been swept up more often in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning parliamentary elections in May last year through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The protesters had initially peacefully held out in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them over the weekend to break into Sharif’s residence.
Hütteldorfer ranked third on the table after his second season win.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week for Rapid took a reconciling ending on Sunday.
"The win is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the start in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
With the second win of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the country game break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defenceman Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth in the 14th minute set the stage for victory.
"I thought I was taking all the frustration from Thursday and shoving it under the latte," the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on November 13, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid breed," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvic injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror-shifted manner.
He deserved the goal, he has already made some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we were a little lucky today," said Schrammel, who pointed to the discrepancy between performance and result in the past few weeks: "The results did not vote, but the gameplay was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that they had been "better in many games before than they are today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
He added: “I’m glad we finally played at zero again.
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be complained, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," said Barisic, who lost in the past three days to Behrendt and Pavelic players "who have been very stable lately".
The country break must therefore be used to "licking wounds and adding a little bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 pickers in his ranks.
One who is particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks down for the team, goes over the pain.
It was in this difficult phase that he showed that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his substitution in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is good now" "We must have had a bit of luck, but at some point luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
Of course, he urged to concentrate on further work: "You can't always see this in black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can really help at the moment.
They are sticking to me at certain stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur and his team had little to blame.
He regretted the rapid counter-strike "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Utz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren’t concrete enough towards goal at some stages.
We had too few finals.
Domestic defender Maximilian Karner looked similar: "It started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
Under this whip there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle game of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the pictured specimen is the "Geissruheiche" above Unterweissenbrunn.
A hollow footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes by clusters, basaltic stone heaps and basaltic stone lakes.
A little below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stands out above the other trees of the surrounding area and resembles an American mammoth tree with a circumference of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the name’s origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweissenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the goat's resting place.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweissenbrunn to the hard-rooted and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers, exhausted by the ascent, are said to have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because goat herds are actually grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, when entering the stone collections one should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweissenbrunn to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are marked, ascending in the direction of Hochrhön and inviting to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought for in our next task, is rather rare to be found in the height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the structure, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building counterfeit could fit.

After weeks of dive, Italy’s Prime Minister and acting EU President Matteo Renzi has imposed the appointment of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit, and she will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-sponsored daily La Repubblica reports, the vocation of his Mogherini, also considered a favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the rebellious left-wing party base against him, because Mogherini is associated with it, albeit in a more moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council Donald Tusk, so the prevailing opinion in Rome, so that a political balance is made.
At the same time, the EU chief diplomat will be deputy to President Juncker.
The pending approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has proven to be successful in leading party offices for nearly two decades and is known for his ambition, will face “enormous challenges”.
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began with a doctorate in political science in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic center party Margherita in 2008 to become the current Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election to the Left Democratic Party in 2001, she joined the high-level party politics, working in the foreign policy department, of which she soon became the head.
She occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, cultivated contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better ratio to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The provisions in Brussels, the new EU foreign minister has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini are haunted by the crisis in Ukraine and defamed as a “Russian-friendly course”.
It supports the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy’s energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
The photos she showed with Putin at the shake-hand were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi, who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Zubis come from Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary and secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all ages and the trainers go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "his love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has come across disapproval by the vast majority of French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for an easing of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, sprinkled sand into the gearbox, appearing at a meeting of renegade socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for taking the French “belief in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the socialists’ constant digging struggles and said she couldn’t imagine the new Valls government lasting more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive autumn or winter either," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that she would emerge victorious in early elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and the record number of unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise just ahead of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruises, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruises.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry stands at a total of around $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers among the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruises was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise carrier owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise entered the stock market in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company, according to approval authorities.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly hold more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the listing of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-loyal group hoisted the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday, which allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with Beijing-loyal members.
This decision makes it nearly impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the polls, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial square with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business districts and organized a sit-in.
Li’s interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon in front of the office of the leadership in Hong Kong.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start "statement talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the abrogation region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to negotiate at eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents is in line with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the outbreaks five months ago: help for the separatists to seize territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Russia to maintain a de facto independence with the Novorossiya for the West.
In an interview with state-run TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossia" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glorious period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of campaigns by Ukrainian politicians for the Oct. 26 elections and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist-held areas, are hoping for soon-to-be peace talks "caged in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start in-depth discussions as soon as possible, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification of the correction of Putin’s “misinterpretation” of remarks underlined Russia’s leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are non-Russian and pre-conflict polls revealed a large majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea annexed five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural address on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the constitution, after new elections, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further incursion by rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russia-backed separatists took control of Nowoasovsk, which according to fears of Ukrainian security officials is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have taken place to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday, urging actions to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are at a point where there is no going back," Poroshenko said.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said in a statement.
The first allegedly 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photos scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noble did not hide his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who from the Hollywood A-Promis.
The film city is thrilled after a series of unique photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal about celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this probably has over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also made private photos public due to an iCloud loophole.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noble, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly said the hack was "shameful" and that those affected felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying up without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available to comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ: “It’s an abhorrent breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers participated yesterday in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-affected children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the others.
But they all agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
Yesterday, for the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus went on a bike to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily hide the little muscle caterpillar there, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for cancer-affected children" (Frankfurt) has also brought him personally a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
A little pause in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves in the early hours of yesterday and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11 km long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The very red green politician from the circle - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then turned out to be a half-professional on the mountain and passed through the goal after 45 minutes without any shortness of breath.
He also slid through the track, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set out with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have taken a trip today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to step back to the height immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
I had fun with Fritten-Toni.
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are just one of them.
He had scored 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must be too, because he was on the "fixie wheel", which is also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed over the white wall and the fox dance to the top prove that it was possible without a wheel, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, ensured safety, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself".
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the club "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes to be able to block the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
