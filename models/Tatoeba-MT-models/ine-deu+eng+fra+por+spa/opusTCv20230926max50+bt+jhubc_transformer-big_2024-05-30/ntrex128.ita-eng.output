Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of clowns"
There is consternation among some members of the Assembly over the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose as a result of the programs to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A Labour Assembly member said his party is concerned that "it may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means asshole and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative party member claimed to be "open" to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently in the process of drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of how members of the Assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received broad support for the possibility of convening the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option has received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a scratch for President Elin Jones, who is expected to come up with a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay to be able to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Silence While Harlem Churches Are In Trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"Today there's none of them."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the estate will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will close altogether because it is unlikely that the vast majority of people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against 125th Street retailers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild it, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated plot by architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the secular church officials, others by the diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was "trying to unload the costs" on the parish assembly, although the latter had not been involved in the assumption of architecture.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old in Shrimp Fishing in California
Official sources say on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of lobster in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy scream and swam up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was only excitement due to catching a lobster but then "he realized the boy was screaming 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire clavicle was torn," he said, noting Hammel had once reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a news release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's program a boost to the beauty products industry in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lanes dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the UK’s significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty product market push, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household sectors decline, the larger beauty product lanes will be tested in 11 UK stores and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use the shelf space once dedicated to TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most products are vegan – a quality increasingly sought after by younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will experience the authorizations at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit more to persuading people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and such a strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to give enamel back to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets into supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-point pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty products departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract with her trendy brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby no longer has time for his Truly housewives and accessories brand.
The couple's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning spokeswoman turned to Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, furious after retiring from their lucrative trending brand business at the last minute to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a meeting held at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to dedicate herself to their brand of home accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and it was calculated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his vacation homes.
According to a source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would engage her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow Headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in launching the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couple spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest on ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he “doesn’t want to comment on his business.”
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would judge “non-presidential” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice imitating the "newspaper conductor".
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first one in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying North Korea had not observed an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions to keep the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea, we are achieving great results,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded camp, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of deaths
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations had been informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is continually undergoing, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common facility on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunami in Palu, although the alarm was given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia’s twin infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has poured money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes due to clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 meters from Chelsea's gate, with his team down for 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and sacked into the net.
"I just tried to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I gave a touch and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centre-front of the Blue passed heel to Mateo Kovacic before sliding off close to half-field and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
So he made a beautiful pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left-hand goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League round at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped among the rubble of the collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and which generated waves up to 6 meters high, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been sprinkled with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the site of the discovery this morning.
Investigations are underway and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone with information about it is invited to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating the register 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal a “crazy” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was unavoidable in light of the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was not ordered or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe has yet to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether it is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of such a fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig killer kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery, covered in blood near a piglet at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the piglet with blood on his cheek.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-kg pig had slaughtered the farmer, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and shredded,” said the cousin identified by the surname “Wu,” as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people as police gather evidence on the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of the blood can act as a "catalyst."
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to hurt.
Just show them the right dose of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa Swirls Will Bring Heavy Extended Rains to Southwestern US
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. coast in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is forming a sack on the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity to the north, in the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Thus, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching sagging will create heavy and extensive precipitation in the southwestern area in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible breaks in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly much of Arizona.
It is possible that sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions occur due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make the river canyons full, and thunderstorms will blow winds and lift dust.
The approaching sacking will cause heavy local rains on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and the beginning of Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm start in October is expected for most of the central and eastern US, with 26°C from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for a last-minute Friday turnaround: a deal devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Commission that she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh touched her intoxicated and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operators Friday morning as he was insulted by demonstrators as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained low-eyed for several minutes while being reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think I'm telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to submit Kavanaugh's appointment to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the accusations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of 'Making Politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to let the European Union “politically” deal with Britain’s future and jeopardize national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective tariffs is “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest LSU Player Dyteon Simpson Death Suspect
Police have arrested a suspect in the death by firearm of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports the CBS-affiliated WAFB television station.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge forensic doctor's office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department has acknowledged the merit of the Louisiana State Police Escape Task Force, the Police Science Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles of ash Mexico City
The ash that emerges from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was checking the various rhombuses and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City’s Xochimilco neighborhood.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity in the volcano that is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by riot police targeted police officers with eggs and dust paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further clashes over the course of the day with police officers who resorted to handcuffs to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independentists who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted the unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remains high in the independentist region a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the government of Madrid but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had widely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt the referendum that was taking place at seats across the region with violent clashes.
The independentist groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he had no hopes of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory although of measure in the regional elections of last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders of the movement finding themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with his phone the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"To present myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Spawning a House with a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at around 7:30 p.m. BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a bullet at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal with Livingston was a win.
The already promoted Livingston left the Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second 18-game defeat as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is therefore left without a home win in the Premiership this season and will face the first in the Hearts rankings next Sunday, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his series of division wins by remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still facing a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston wastes opportunities against less incisive guests
Holt’s team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Ranger a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out of the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's header on the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put visitors in difficulty with kicks.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated in possession of the ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much.
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game schedule.
The crosses took place in the Livingston area and were continually neutralized, while two demands for rigor, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for fault of the hand, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their playing style and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to boost the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some times with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below these standards.
It missed the last pass - only once they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and it can be considered an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranks.
Erdogan received with conflicting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at extending relations between NATO allies.
They clashed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police motivated the operation for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, have voiced their condemnation of Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died instantly.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died, hit by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the men's high-security prison, the prison's office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin High Security Men's Prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized agents "Tornado" have been employed to manage the riot, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and may be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison.”
The Long Lartin prison is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October of last year, anti-mobbing agents were called to intervene in the prison to sedate a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the desert’s southwest, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations will likely be positive as the southwestern area is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will lead to the landlocked through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who was still maintaining hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds at a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will clash with the coldest waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening on Monday.
Rainfall on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, then head across Arizona and towards southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her creeks are intense rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern area of Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that such rains could generate potentially deadly sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as debris on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "Suffered for the Evil and Anger" of Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered for the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh pleaded before Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also pleaded guilty to the charges.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced law minds of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented record in public service,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really busy," he said.
"For this struggle strenuously for outstanding candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committed to “resisting and hindering.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many swept away by giant waves that crashed on beaches when a large-scale earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to 6 meters (18 feet) hit the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster control agency, told Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The siege continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications "were totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting agitated way to warn of the coming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall collapsed on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to authorities, the army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced people still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's awful.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff managed to reach the town of Palu, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they encountered scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's awful.
Even as the rescue groups began the difficult operations of starting the rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescuers with extensive knowledge have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations stipulate that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start arriving if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing still held the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding riders.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I'm carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu’s competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single grey check mark rather than two blue marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM supply in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "shouldered behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about the identities of the offenders is invited to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On announcing the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The person formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye – the reflection of our goodness, our evilness, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also changed his name with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the artificial intelligence industry, the U.S. should double its research funding in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several U.S. government groups regarding AI, although the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its program last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are much behind the U.S. and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big success in the AI industry will be achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Otello’s American player with the highest score and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would take place, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a special commission for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. ordinance aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on a possible change of the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbors is a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Slav-majority Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the attendance will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have declared that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had expressed their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union accession in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and setting the chairs in front of the curtains set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads high, not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favor because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV showed that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scores a goal avoiding the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of the defense of Brighton during the 2-0 win from Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his score in the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before surpassing several others at the boundary of the Brighton area.
He then made a left turn, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right shot in the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that point.”
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the field of Brighton.
He sent a nice filter ball along his left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker pulled the ball off the net shortly before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the as always competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who maintain an advantage over a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one rematch with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play without a goal, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level of all this year.
And why should I never want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, on Thursday performed a launch session and would be the first launcher on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"Everything we did was put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really doing my best for it, I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any means necessary, you can see evil, meanness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they must overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, and we won’t give them.”
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of “resisting and hindering.”
"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, bad, mean and liars."
She referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm expecting one -- that was a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Don't tolerate people who say what they think
When momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, they are the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated similarly because he is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a trend reversal from me and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow insinuations of insults on social media calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the centre’s policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my fellow Members because the comments made to me tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of insults against a sexist or racist background every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party narrows down.
In the last two years I have been given many advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have been fine".
But that’s not what I went into politics to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by thatcher government’s carelessness that had left my high school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way puzzled by my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage our family nuclei, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I consider to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr climbs the rankings
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent’s championship day.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” the coach said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said, “We have to recognize Ayr’s merit, they have taken better advantage of our opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, untied by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigour before, just halfway, scoring and then converting a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was stretched, and at restart, the Ayr jumped again to the lead thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's replacement captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
The home team is back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a clash with Climo without ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind Ayr's advancing mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost from the restart, after Rowe had picked up the football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the home team's fifth-half.
Still Game star seeks new career in catering
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays alongside longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems that Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, though a Scottish Sun source made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering business."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a sea outlet hopes a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters lined with tailoring in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia without an outlet to the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to once again traverse the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached their highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of intermittent dialogue – Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a sea of state competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - has a lot to do with Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final rulings indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has blown up any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain discussions after what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will enjoy “extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile” and will have the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political scam.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen Without Confidence in U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems intent on resuming stalled diplomatic talks after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that the continued U.S. sanctions and opposition to an end to the Korean War could never bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not hesitate to issue the declaration without Pyongyang taking important disarmament actions first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows feature the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of caps or completely block the rays of the sun, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized capes for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats raged on Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their captivating creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled anchovies, a witch hat, and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a dive suit with a mask and glasses, while another looked like a loose ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you are lucky.
The style observers predict that the huge hats could reach you in the high-fashioned streets.
Outsize hats arrive in the wake of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a wide stretch more than a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costumed model who wears it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I anticipate these big hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aspire to prepare students for a subsequent higher education, the career choice and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and in-demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach the heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest scores.
The data, collected from the 74 member schools of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students received the highest grade with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish received the highest grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees have indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically bring a multilingual person to the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of more languages, in particular of those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with teacher staff specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future may be.
It is not possible at this time, in a global trading system, to deny that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be determined for how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked what his plans for the six-game pre-championship schedule were.
"At this point in my career, I don't need friendly matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a raft of gatherings.
This is the first of five gatherings scheduled for Trump next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s rally be and how can you follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely speak about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual violence with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of rallyes is to help Republicans who have to face the November elections get some push.
So, President Trump’s campaign stated that these five gatherings over the course of next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busiest season of the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could draw back supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in line for polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday’s singles
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum motion is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
Where would the motorcycle be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I'd say we're keeping a bit of a bike," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their favor, as Spieth has said, and they have a lot to be hopeful for, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The festive guttural screams became louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to tie the bills in game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt who made them win the 15-hole game was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you he believes the American team is not out of the race yet.
“You really have to worry about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple in Europe is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the roaring crowd, consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Yet European glory speeches are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it early to reach Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even far go back.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a major lead in the final day but this foursome session showed that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing the fourball and foursome games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to preserve the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an uneven American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has resisted more in the foursomes, winning two games, but has failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a knocked down Woods and newcomer American Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who crawled for two games on Saturday, showed occasional sparks of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, at rest during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson’s side in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number one and three in the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the expected results in a pleasant and ventilated day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a grim 2&1 win over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point gap to singles, although as a goalkeeper, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament with no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was heightening the country's mistrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said on the occasion of the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea took "important measures of goodwill" during the past year, such as the halt to nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first."
Although Ri has reused notes of complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees to North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to loosen the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists on the need to 'have denuclearization first' and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive way and even opposes the 'end of war declaration,'" Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to programs of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader announced at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the counterpart to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point.”
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he stated that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after “the president of evil” Trump called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to embark on the path of disarmament, but said much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a deadline, stating that “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Compliance with the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously supported the control sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster requests."
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. had taken “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security assurances Trump had committed to in Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all of its students to sleep more in an attempt to counteract the growing male culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, developed the course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea to start the course after a conference he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this only being told to me now, when I’m in the last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride tied to the “white night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to a lack of sleep being an ever-growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with good quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid obesity as lack of sleep brings the brain into a sleepless mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student enrolled in the faculty of chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they need to go to bed, as well as for when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home depression attack with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking for the first out-of-home win from the February 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points away from the Ladbrokes Premiership's fugitive leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of the interval and a short-inspired Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
While the Ranger is now down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third, and only behind the Hibernian for goal difference.
And there could be additional problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence watchman was cured of a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual formation that ripped a point at the Hearts last week and would be pleased with the way his well-prepared team choked their opponents at each lap.
The Rangers may have dominated by possession of the ball but the Livingston has made better use of the balls at their disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filtering pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pull aside on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he needed to be given a penalty at the end of the fifteenth after a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to score only twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't let Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria both worry.
Although the opening goal of Livingston in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even just because of his commitment.
Again, the Rangers failed to manage a deep-seated football of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact as the wing shoved a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final request for severity after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and CONTEGIO continues... the day when the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the Geiger counter also became a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those uncredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Hey, he's just bursting right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then “see” a protein common to numerous types of cancer and are then re-injected.
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can “see” a protein common to numerous cancers, called HER2, and then those cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", including that in the breast, ovaries, lungs and colon-rectal, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to “teach” them how to hit cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whispered in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after an unfinished performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA cap, he began a fury against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so many times and they say to me, ‘As much as you like Trump, he’s a racist!’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against the sexual violence allegations filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West’s Philippine film was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
In addition, West complained with the audience that he had a bad time in the backstage because of his headscarf.
“They bullied me in the backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And so they told me I’m an outcast,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place submerged?" and said, "I'd wear the Superman cloak because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try the love."
His comments sparked whistles at least twice from the audience and the members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the magazine: "On the study there was a deadly silence."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HAVING HEADED THE MASS.”
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what it is and this is simply wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vomiting ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's friend, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion and of course the disappeared musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus to the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast Prefecture on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Sword Throne Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such screen floors often make kids believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Spade's Throne, admitted to worrying a lot about this issue.
"Personally I'm worried, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
“Something went wrong for the young people.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not perform any prequels or sequels to Throne of Swords once the series ends next summer, claiming to have "ended with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Sword Throne.
“I met my wife during this show, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an urgent issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The U.S. lawmaker denounced on Saturday the allegations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators in the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles said the statements were fomented by opinionists and “ultra-right wing” websites.
“Bugs, lies, and even more contemptible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol during a panel hearing on allegations of sexual violence against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts has been associated with the Waters office and have released information relating to a Waters staff member.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been jeopardized as a result of these false and tendentious allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of such information.
This unfounded accusation is utterly false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
He must not question the prosecution's reasons.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to dismiss Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office has alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement of these tendentious allegations.
“We will make sure that those responsible are exposed,” he continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English strikes again - the parody of the spy with a undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
The veiled self-irony on the topic of how dirty we do will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and eyes out of orbit has obtained his license to mess things up for the second time – and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for non-English-speaking film-goers.
Obviously it is the silly secret agent that despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme of Glory Moments of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It’s a character originally based on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s now-forgotten television commercials, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers swirl briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems pretty undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comicness as an ingredient.
The humor seems directed at children rather than adults and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as the gags of the silent films of Atkinson when he plays Mr Bean.
The immutable current premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A hacker infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the field, with dismay of the agent in charge, a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that makes the jar overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who’s already suffering a backlash of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this like-for-like character Theresa May but there’s not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call someone already retired.
And this means that the wretched Johnny English, who now works as a school manager in a chic factory, but who also teaches informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some cute gags, when English offers a spy course like School of Rock.
English is beaten up in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin of the Disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s cyber problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by clandestinely entering Volta's luxury yacht, and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to tame the inside of the house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the final sequence, but as ragged and exuberant as it is, there is a lot of children's TV throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to be drafting a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like the major companies to transfer the savings obtained with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to lean the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior Labour member told The Sunday Times: "By the end of the year it is expected to announce a revision of the policy line."
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy unanimous support from the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not part of the party’s political line and is not currently the subject of discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to highlight his vision of an economic socialist revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless leaders" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock, as the Labour government could implement “deductions” based on behavior deemed illegal.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of the net worth of private sector companies to employees, which end up putting in annual dividend pockets up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say to "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises doubts as to whether the government agency’s findings could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will air on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring something out that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said that while I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that the accusation had come out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
It was determined, determined, unmistakable.”
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could withstand a bomb-proof charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she nominated couldn't prove it.
36 years have passed.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the performance of a remarkable carnival of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Coming to the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that helped raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But, exactly, how successful was the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve the intended goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to ask for a call to action, or is it just another example of so-called “cliktivism”—people who feel like they’re really making a difference simply by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, working for a bunch of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, aimed at affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from their shares, of which they have already been repaid or used as funds for at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that up to now, hedge funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and performers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 Cities from Global.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live 2018 concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favor of nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we will fail and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke asserted that Russian involvement in Syria – in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are means and ways to cope with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the defendants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “unvery versatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that is by far the cheapest for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, a “inappropriate” pipeline project that, according to Trump, made Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly highlighted that the $11 billion gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, designed to double the capacity of the pre-existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. Secretary of State for Energy Rick Perry.
The US position triggered Germany's negative reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay out of the European Union’s energy policies and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take “serious consideration” to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up our misguided government, and that means having a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the city assembly Warren said his own on President Donald Trump, declaring that he was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
Warren tweeted: “It’s natural that we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for office in 2020.
58 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for a candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed on a potential 2020 candidacy include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with a case of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can relate it to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers come back with,” he told audiences at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, about his son and other war veterans, "they are coming back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have consecrated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a narcotic gun, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and District of Columbia Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a memoir amicus curiae to Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged such a policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang children" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed asylum seekers without documents fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of particular cases and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates that principle,” the document states.
In the memoir, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning immigrants from entering the U.S. is damaging the economy, saying there is a clear likelihood that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “provided the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been designed to mitigate every problem -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate recovery attempts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
“There’s a lot of tension,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while comforting her febrile little child in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"At every moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scouring among their frail personal belongings, in an attempt to recover whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to continued strong siege shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the sensation of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
“There was no time to save us.
"I've been crushed among the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Making Pretensions’ with ‘Advertising Propaganda’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper, advertising U.S.-China trade mortgages, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, peasants and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now increases those arrogances by publishing advertising in our free newspapers."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in the paper on the street here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese population might have on China’s problematic economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers circumvented the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which newspaper it is.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court and stand by him in facing various allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
“You can’t take these things away,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate room, when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats are going to the stars,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among indecisive peripheral electricians and young voters, between 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite displeasure with the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had hypothesized that a negative reaction could have occurred if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confused set,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about voting for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person they believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of drunkenness when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
It can include contact lists, things to do, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell “Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely shattered from day to day.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann commemorated the ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England ecclesiastical to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, received recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a commemorative plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificantly symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years from his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog, under the heavy fire of the field and war machines."
Then he rushed towards the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" made the line advance before he ran with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never be up to and something that makes me more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people."
MMA fans stood up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine for a while, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were left stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad taste joke.”
“The government regulation foresees that at 6:00 a.m. that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep the pig," "yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker has said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed a lot of messages arrived and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We’re going to limit it to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling ‘Inferior’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality — but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize, until he got to high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4’s first episode of Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she had made her voice heard about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the old-fashioned program, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off due to illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
She said: “Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and of feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful.”
He wanted to try to be “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they accidentally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said the fact of falling in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “took me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you spend so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said her "whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that I had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father had not accepted the fact that she was dying and that one of the last things she asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 — because she wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that it was not invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze medal.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come in the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The off-shape Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for a twelfth time on record, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often been for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what haunts him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unsettled course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the path itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces careful British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who collaborated with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and it’s added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably hadn’t imagined playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it would go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even remotely reflected the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, cunning, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the meeting room,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players have had a lot of fun cementing against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did a lot more than play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable chase.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point separation from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I keep repeating to myself that we had a good lead at Valderrama, we had it at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but by little," Bjorn said (in the photo) after watching the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
"So it will be history to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
You have to do your best tomorrow.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not finished until the points are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we have to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who is on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his people competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of the individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look for the best individual rather than team performance in his players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those great matches of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 led his players in the final day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start right away with the right foot as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain bend, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the kids in the way we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the route to the end,” Bjorn said of his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era military ships, but it won't be until at least next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the flagship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues haunted the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from the national ports.
However, the ongoing delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate Type F-125 made the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Hamburg shipyard Blohm & Voss.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship weighs significantly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in light of the recent alarms concerning the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy is actually “lacking ships that can be employed.”
The official said the issue has worsened significantly over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class was able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research in a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use their eyesight to get food.
We are confident that the findings can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists’ study will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton’s brown ears and bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of calls from bats and the way each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the findings can reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Butterflies are at risk due to construction and development work that involves wedges and destroys habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Butterflies aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grasping a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the trenches and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first bat-only reserve at Threave Farm, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here at Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It underlines the importance of checking bats before conducting maintenance inside the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trough could kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps sweeping away an entire local population.
Butterflies are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their pets.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are going through it.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise themselves” under his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker of Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced on Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep silence about the incident.
In a video on Instagram directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours following the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, scrapped the statements as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or facing the camera.
“They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I’m happy and all is well,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call “an inadmissible reporting of suspects on the private sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages to the extent corresponding to the severity of the privacy breach, considered probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years.”
The incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have gotten on his knees after the incident by saying he was for the "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga says she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement because she felt "terrified by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "may forever regret" the loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He also added that he was "concerned" by the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the consequent temporary production blockade at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Minister Clark said.
The Japanese automaker claims that delays at the borders, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
There is growing concern in other UK car manufacturers about leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will shut down its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be inconveniences at the borders that would cause delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely thought out to avoid these inconveniences at the borders.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long run, it warns that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the plant’s trade union delegates, says workers are deeply concerned: “In my experience, once jobs are cut, they are no longer reinstated.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for a week” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and it was rumored that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN at the time in New York, was announced on Wednesday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of investigation into the FBI's questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's final vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be postponed another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and keep updating the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Conductor Chris Wallace asked for the reason.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to television journalists "putting themselves on display", although he said, "I do not disagree with the fact that they put themselves on display."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, adding, without citing evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it, as we’ve done in recent weeks, and this will replace the press briefings and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have proved his point by giving a free-wheeling, and at the same time bizarre, speech in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister Writes to Scottish NHS Workers to Express Concerns About Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman has sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to addressing the costs of requests for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, irrespective of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves healthcare work, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31-27, according to Mike Organ of The Tennessean newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the campground and fainted," Reed said.
First responders and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on board the camp, before putting him in a stretcher and taking him away for further check-ups.
A Tennessee State executive reported to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no news about the type and extent of the damage" and that the Tennessee State are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
He had made a total of five platings before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 platings.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bill taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bribe taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to new Labour plans.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The bill tax increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bribe taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in the bribe tax will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will support the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homelessness.
The surcharge, which adds to the current bullying tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the maneuver to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a tax cut to help younger people buy the first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping high real estate prices by seizing land without using it, and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to settle Britain’s “real estate misfortune.”
MEP Corbyn announced a staggering set of proposals for housing market reform, including lease controls and the elimination of blameless evictions.
It also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said that I would commit myself to restoring the British dream, namely that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was just as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies as it is for UK resident workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland’s Technical Director Jack Ross says his “maximum aspiration” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scottish is attracted by the challenge of bringing up the Northeastern team that is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I’ve been in Serie B and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross's predecessors to lead Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he feels no anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I will only succeed if I can get the team back on track.”
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach for the Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa save themselves from relegation to the third level and led St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his career as a footballer in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really believed that the role of manager was made for me, more than that of a player.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and work pressure but the management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel much calmer than I’ve ever been in my life.”
You can hear the full interview on Sportssound on Saturday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
According to a study, the right time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has brought more revenue to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data show that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s business consulting firm, put the data together and commented: “The persistence of the sun and England’s long standing at the World Cup made July follow a path similar to that of June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent drop in catering in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where most people drink were the most solid, with a homogeneous increase higher than the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs where you eat have suffered the heat, although not as excessively as the caterers.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and managed bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent a month, while food consumption fell three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s Recreation and Reception Analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, though a 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly heavy in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for caterers and only weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce."
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.

One in five children own secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some just 11 years old, owns secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Instagram" pages
The news has reinforced the fear that sexually explicit content may be posted.
20 percent of students said they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates social network accounts that keeps them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake” Instagram accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content may be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they managed a clean “main” account to show their parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40 percent of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice for athletes' at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board during the National General Assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the nomination as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect from the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could take a huge advantage by bringing her to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland.”
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently an opinionist of the BBC, has found herself unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, he learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
Advertisement of a bullfighter compares mothers and cows and divides online opinion
A company that produces a sledgehammer has divided opinion online with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers and cows that are ridden.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “world’s first silent and wearable thumbnail,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad in the form of a funny music video to showcase the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new thumbnail.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, "Yes, I'm throwing my milk but I don't have a thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts but my tits."
The choir continues: “Put it out, put it out, feed the children, put it out, put it out, put the milk out to my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It's an unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth.”
The Elvie pullover wears discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: “Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the little one.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a mummy who will continue to keep their children?”
Someone else added: “It’s really pointless advertising.”
Others have defended her and a woman has even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd like to have one.
When I was using the drawer, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn’t go far from reality.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun ad dedicated to moms who use pulleys (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows’.”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet pullover inserted into the bra.
The concept that the campaign is inspired by is based on the idea that many women who use pulleys feel like cows.
However, the Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be inserted into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold the children in their arms and even get out as they pull the milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD commented: “The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the drawer to the cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new drawer is able to ensure."
This isn't the first time Elvie has made news.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to a Tendpole on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy line has made it harder for these children to entrust.
Most of those who relied on them were usually illegal immigrants who now fear to jeopardize the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we’re continuing to hunt down these people,” Albence said.
To try to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work at reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to file their legal case with an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit to receive help will be quickly expelled.
The longer children remain in care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent anger attacks or attempts to flee, according to those who work at reception points and the reports that emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure like Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children’s discomfort signals to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tendons without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home even though the war has now reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without imposing any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions have been forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "instilling unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return,” he said.
“What should be just a humanitarian problem is being politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be allocated to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “precise deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters of the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, which will “be eradicated”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a draft constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” without any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, his presidency should end prematurely due to an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency finale ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of a decline in spectators.
Since 2014, first night rates have more than doubled to $1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to $1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in the first evening, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” program surpassed the network’s percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
“It’s a fire people are drawn to because it’s not something explainable,” says Neal Baer, showrunner on the ABC television series “Designated Survivor,” which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, “Because it makes me laugh.”
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families can come together or not, and the state of health of the global economy.
Stopping to follow the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond its duty for informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of intricacies that Stortomy's disgusts implies").
I can’t watch Super Mario anymore without thinking about it.
“Part of why what he does seems like a reality show is that every night there’s new stuff,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Pawn Stars, about the interplay of actors and daily developments in the plot of the show.
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was indoors watching MSNBC and in the meantime was recording CNN.
He was unable to break away from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and facing the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: “I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External money influx in the race for the tightest midterm elections
It’s no surprise that in the 17th district there is an influx of money due to the realignment of a congressional district that has made two incumbent members now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh puts Democratic Representative Conor Lamb on the scene, who took his place in another district during a special election that took place last spring.
Lamb is racing against another incumbent member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in old districts electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then they changed their mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather friendly meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization’s leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the U.S. for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murdered.
After a series of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been appointed to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a demonstration of the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of reproach or punishment from Washington.
Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to remain anonymous anyway.
Study the history
In the report, Special Counsel Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of obstructing justice, a fact of which there seems to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller’s investigation aims to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not intend to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, as it is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight might last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion we failed by letting go of the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans have to deal with different things at the moment.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that last year it secretly suggested that Trump be subjected to interceptions, questioning his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein says the news in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare to face a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season just on the occasion of the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result could allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the thirty-one-year-old.
“We played the game confidently and made a point at home.
Perhaps we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents got a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
“Last year has certainly been difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level, but now the feeling is positive.
The team is in shape, the boys are having fun and preparation is going well.
So we can forget about last season’s problems and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of Nationwide respondents say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide, “People want it to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t address this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk about it with your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate in time what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide together with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determinant of costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he will be able to advise you on how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
Choosing long-term care funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a redeemable hybrid life insurance policy to cover these expenses or continue to pay for insurance as long as you are able to.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles to your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of an attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is being taken to the hospital in an emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finances, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”
Man shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed-air rifle while falling down on foot after spending the evening outside.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see his aggressor.
It is not in danger of death and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a very strong earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Communications have been disrupted and rescuers have been unable to get any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Donggala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299.200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western Donggala area in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called the Pacific Fire Belt and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a very strong earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, of whom more than half Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that swept over the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people remembering the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing the complaint and resisting the arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she ripped her phone off.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three counts of first-degree crimes, including up to one year in detention and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree offence punishable by a day’s detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the reporting of crime and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a punch in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome resulting from the period spent in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity grid and the communications grid are not working and the victims' balance sheet is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for Suspects of Terrorist Attacks in NYC
New York’s federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people: a rare sentence that has never been imposed since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to plunge onto a bike lane along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for demanding the death penalty in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and also "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued 22 charges against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with association to criminals, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of automobiles.
The attack called for “real planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
Ten years have passed since the southern district of New York prosecuted the latest case of capital punishment.
The man, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of espionage conspiracy and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of regret in the days and months following the attack.
Police say they were proud of what they did in front of investigators.
According to the accusation, Saipov told authorities that he had decided to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 defendants, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a conviction and sentence to life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s advocacy group had previously begged prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Must Conduct Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage has vowed to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May’s party MPs suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would “already be out of Europe” if Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underlined by the pro-European Torys who took part in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and the "chaos".
At the summit of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of negotiating with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
"At this time we would already be out of Europe," he said.
Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected views that public opinion would change by the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false."
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the rally and told reporters: “I’m just telling the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who run the streets for votes to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message to May, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meal in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Torys against Brexit flags after the group’s formation this weekend.
The Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the frictionless borders and for the borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit does not exist,” he said.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that Trump could challenge in 2020 has been in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town hall since Trump settled.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to settle the government and this implies that a woman will take the highest position.”
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime holding a gun and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in detention at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims last season played 32 games, 10 of which were held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately apparent that the orders of the Mercedes team would heavily condition the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel is the first to stop at the boxing, leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group’s queue, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the stop the next lap by returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpasses him after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent the passage inside risking to end out after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the boxes for the tire change and tries to finish quickly to surpass Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
In the end, however, he must make the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds he is unable to increase the pass and overcome Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and he was really nice to get me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of winning the first and second place," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting that he had not disclosed the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “small, bad, and liars.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and liars," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being released and those in charge say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Do you remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it...No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion has been leaked from his office.
"I have not concealed Professor Ford's accusations, but I have not revealed her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who during Saturday night's rally commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to pass over to regain power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants immediately passed in front of two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the draw for the Dundees before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who on Friday evening in Belfast had climbed back up and won the game with the Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assists, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assists.
In what was a rather lively first time, Sullivan brought the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the assist of the draw to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the lead for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard regained the draw after a strategic maneuver in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led the Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games at this point, will play their next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape from earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after his death to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing due to a strong earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong siege shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his seat in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which was oscillating terribly.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"For us it's really sad news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of casualties could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Countermeasures Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the men of the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the activities related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, according to CNN.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there is a missing person after the lagoon accident
The airline of the flight that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to escape, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, one passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash occurred while the plane was trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Airline and Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very low altitude.
“And it was really a fortune,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a deck provided relief using a hose to transport people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in PNG registered airline plane crashes but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
On Saturday, the filing of the indictment in the new trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several cell phones that show that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in the Sanford truck that night, the latter confirmed that he was “lies because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The mobile data indicates that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the jury to pass judgment later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages in their songs.
The band The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop drifted away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to the origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently resurfaced in the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York-based stepdaughter sues a couple for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York, a dad cited a couple in court for dismissing her in a discriminatory manner after she accidentally received a text in which the mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new stepmother, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" dismissed Ms. Maurice saying she was not happy with their previous stepmother, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Ms. Maurice a day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice has sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks a beauty compensation of $350 per day for the six months full-time work for which she was initially hired, even if without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegation of racism by stating that the firing of Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you’ve been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said the wife had given birth for just two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't hang out with a person this way.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has immediately denounced the spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It's not easy to get into the shoes of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s fun now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the toy bear-inspired children's book, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” he says.
But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your merit.
I think that's how he interpreted Paddington's success.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
At the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not do it,” says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then she called me to tell me she was going to die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a little earlier, and that was the end.
I had to sit down and wait knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"Nobody knew," he says.
“All I’ve done is cry with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Tickets of two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide commit suicide to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that it illuminated every room he entered.”
But before he died, he left his job because the depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's going to be a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, has lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
“You never said you felt down or depressed,” he says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
The Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to deal with: "He has torn the family apart.
He broke us up.
But we had to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain: the FBI has begun investigations
"I think if we could proceed as he asked, with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "losing calm" because of the blockade of rooted supporters.
Why do Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left in the midterm elections, on November 6. If the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
The Senate is currently comprised of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the delay and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, says there were 1,127 refugees last year versus 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs demanded from those who illegally expel these people.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This follows the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to collaborate to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he's not fit for Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not characterfully fit to hold such a position.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think if a woman behaved in the same way, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Visibly excited, Kavanaugh denied the accusation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in a state of excitement, almost screaming and with his throat tightened from crying as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats who called the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated defamation campaign” organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proven to be prevented against the Democrats.
“I think he’s self-excluded with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked whether she would try to indict Kavanaugh if confirmed and whether Democrats should reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is it not suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court that now presides,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: “You cannot send a hysterical person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And she went on, "A woman who was a manager somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so it continued.
I thought hers was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as a outpouring of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when I once started crying for an access of anger. A woman older than me, an ice manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified, took me to the counter and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let me see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they have you in their hands.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his run for president.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business Hart's extramarital affair was discovered that she had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't have tried herself to run for the presidency.
“It was actually not a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was definitely no need for another one.
Some called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late in raising funds and swore she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause at the start.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the male candidates $1,000 to her would only give 250.
“Do they think I can get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment toward the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger over the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she moved.
“It seemed like I was in a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled, thinking of the reaction from the press.
“Someone might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
"Maybe she's crying a lot."
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been frail and, while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth more than $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>175 billion). This means that taxes will be applied on half of goods from China.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same type by recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on US $60 billion in goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. at once and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon step back.
For Washington to give up, it would have to yield to its demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the U.S. can positively affect China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is indeed far more dangerous than has been recognized so far,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's condition is improving.
“Today, the situation on the territory is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid subject to conditions or from those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot in the water at the 16th hole of par 3 granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds by becoming one of four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen in the European team rankings.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight, has become the European player who has won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have regained the cup.
It’s a team victory and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the witness to his compatriot John Ram who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods by scoring 2&1 in Sunday's singles.
“If I think I grew up watching his matches, I’m really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now the count of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team sought to find the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We have thrown away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed very well.
We'll reorganize. I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all together.
