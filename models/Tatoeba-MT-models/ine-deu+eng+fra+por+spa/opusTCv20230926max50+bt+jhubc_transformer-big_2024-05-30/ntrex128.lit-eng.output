Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that it “looks like dolls”
Some members of the Assembly have decided on a proposal to change their name to MWP (literally, a Welsh Member of Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to laughter at the political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said his group was concerned, "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: The Welsh language "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "coke".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the whole faction was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his faction was "open" about changing the name, but noted that it was an abbreviation of the word from MWP to "doll".
In fact, the Welsh letter w is said to be similar to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the name, said: “The final decision on the names of all members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.”
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals that received strong support for naming the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to the members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly clearly offer alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement could become a headache for the presidency's Elin Jones, who is expected to submit legislative drafts on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also cover other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on disqualification of a member of the Assembly and the plan of the committee system.
When debating legislation, members of the Assembly will have a decisive voice on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A global vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the referendum on the change of name, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said that the vote would be ignored.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin and other churches were heard during Harlem’s difficulties.
“The old people I spoke to said that historically, at every corner, you could find a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“You won’t find one or the other today.”
He said that it is understandable why the bars disappeared.
“People are talking differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
Speaking of churches, he is concerned that the money received from the sale of the property will not last long, as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that the churches can be replaced by multi-apartments with cooperative apartments, where people will live who will not help the remaining shrines.
“Most of the people who buy cooperative apartments in these apartments will be white,” he said, “and therefore will rush the moment when the churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation was founded in the 1950s.
The nearby Black Congregation took the name of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation with the clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led a retail boycott on 125th Street, the main Harlem store, where blacks were refused employment or appointments.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but as the parishioners of spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of spiritual father Johnson and heir to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the charlion the bells of the poor.
Experts who coined the carillon in July have called it a "treasure of culture" and an "immutable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Linda. 18 years ago, he began playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church had not replaced him with another musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin’s Church has been a complex history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the laity of the Church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish’s governing body, made up of lay leaders, expressed concern to the diocese that the diocese would “try to pass on expenses” to the parish, although it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained that the diocese is lacking transparency.
Shark injures lobster at 13-year-old in California
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobster on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
He was attacked at 7:00 a.m. in Ensinitas, near the beach of Lighthouse.
Chad Hammel's San Diego KSWB-TV said he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then came in with the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but then realized that the boy was yelling, “He bit me!
I was bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keys had been plundered.
“I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: ‘A shark is floating in the water!’”
The boy was taken on a plane to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was admitted to being in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark the boy was.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a news release that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials shut down the beach from Casablado Ponto to Ensinitas Svam for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty departments of universal stores, where specialist consultants will work.
As the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market continues to grow and sales of fashion and household goods decline, larger beauty departments will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are on the rise, and shopping malls are looking for ways to use shelves once designed for televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also get more local brand areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The mall is also releasing its "Boutique" makeup range, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will try out discounts at two of Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open later this year in Sely Oake, Birmingham.
Because of online shopping and the desire to buy in small quantities every day from local essential stores, shopping malls need to do more to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said branded outlets are increasingly looking like universal stores as shopping malls try to fight off selling goods cheaper at Aldi and Lidl stores by offering no more groceries and groceries.
Sainsbury's added Argos sales to hundreds of stores and also set up a number of Habitat stores after buying both networks two years ago, which are said to have boosted food sales and made them more profitable.
The previous attempt by the mall to update its beauty and pharmacy department failed.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute over how to distribute income from pharmacy stores in the malls.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, Celesio, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was claimed that Lloyds’ contribution to this plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the exterior and atmosphere of the beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places, we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones says he's "shocked" at Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has "taken over" after TV host Holly Willoughby brokered a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their home turnover and accessories for the Truly brand.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning spokeswoman said on her Instagram account.
Holly Willoughby left a lucrative lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "infuriated" when a golden television girl at his business empire's headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, at a tense meeting on Tuesday, admitted that new deals aiming at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million would not give him "a lot of time" to sign up.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's trademark Goop, and it was predicted to double H. Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth of assets.
As 37-year-old H. Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his summer cottages.
The source said Truly had been one of Holly’s top priorities so far.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, lasting for the next couple of decades.
His decision to leave was surprising to everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the start was so close.
Marlou Headquarters is full of ready-to-sell warehousing."
Experts believe that the release of The Morning, one of Britain’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to large investments in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household items.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for more than a decade.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu founded Truly, and 52-year-old P. Jones joined the fight as president.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones holds 40 percent of Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin, the host of I'm A Celebrity.
A nearby Jones source said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business.”
We talked hard and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media's criticism of the comments he made, which some might call "non-presidential," as well as the way he responded positively to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a laughing voice, a “news leader” said:
"I didn't say no."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was backed by a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been underway.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving a "correct response" from the United States to the North's approach.
He noted that instead, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
He expressed a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We are now in a very good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of U.S. troops to their homes.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people wanting to get into this nailed arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroyed Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, this was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been very clear that international aid is not needed, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Rescue Children is preparing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether workers working abroad will be able to work on the spot.
A spokesman for the national disaster agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although tsunami rigs were built in Aceh, they are not common on other shores.
Due to the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens, Palu, despite the announced warning, is likely to have increased the number of lives lost.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters have made logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship deployed in Lombok, which treats victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Palu, but it will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo chose the reconstruction of Indonesia’s collapsed infrastructure as the center of his election campaign, he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give the Joko administration peace of mind, as he will again take part in the elections in the coming year.
Joko also faces pressure from the persistence of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other ordinary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a long-distance equalizer in a game with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League game after scoring a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
With their team behind 1–0, Xherdan Shaqiri handed the ball to former Sturridge about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He passed the ball on his left leg and hit the long-distance turn.
The ball raised high above the penalty area flies to the upper right corner of the net.
He eventually flew over the dancing Kepa’s Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get in a position to get the ball, and players like Shaqs are always playing as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to stay as long as possible for the kick,” Sturridge said.
“I saw Kante running back, I fixed the ball with one touch, and without thinking too much, I just snapped.”
After Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea scored a 25-minute goal from the first lift 1-0.
During the attack, the attacker of the "blue" in the middle of the square with the heel returned the ball to Mateo Kovacicius and rushed to the side of Liverpool.
In the middle of the square, the wall quickly collapsed.
Then they sent the ball between the opponents to Hazard, who was breaking into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and, through Liverpool player Alisson Becker, drew the ball into the net with a left-footed punch to a long-distance twist.
Liverpool team will play in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy) with Napoli.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
As the country's disaster agency reported earlier on Sunday, the death toll in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people had been trapped in buildings that had collapsed in the wake of a 7.5-point earthquake that caused a 6-metre wave on Friday.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, has been swept away by the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was fatally wounded
The murder investigation was launched after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhed (Mercedes) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. near Grayson Mouse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people who have seen or heard people speak in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "So far the investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhed and saw or heard someone suspicious of contacting us.
I would also like to reach out to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have captured something on the video recorder, and contact us as they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhed and she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who know the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still underway as police said they were informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Graison Mouse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the building.
He lost his promise when they found out what had happened.
Residents have now been informed that they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard as a police officer explained to one person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman at the scene of the crime appeared bespoke.
She kept saying, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the fence on the inside, and another van behind it from the outside.
Many officers stood on the inside of the fence and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, with the number of September 30, 247.
The statues of Parliament Cromwell are hit by the last blow of the "rewriting of history" dispute.
Its elimination would be poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, which was blamed on the fanatic followers of the Puritans of Cromwell.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate over the relocation of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s statue at Westminster Palace inevitably had to become a target.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Tom in the last century.
Created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, Cromwell’s stunning image is a reflection of the 19th-century approach and a part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of reverence.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more numerous than today, at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, and that, of course, was a monarchy.
Whether this is accurately depicted, historians have disputed so far.
One is clear that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord are also worth mentioning and honoring.”
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, in the southwest China market, a pig attacked and killed a farmer.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan had been found dead, having been engulfed in blood by a damaged artery and lying next to a piglet at Liupanshu Market in Guizhou Province, southern China.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Sining (Chinhai Province, China) was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm.
He said he and his cousin from neighboring Junana province planned to travel to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin spotted the deceased relative and found the door open to the neighboring pig.
He said there was a large pig in the pigsty, whose mouth was smeared with blood.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had crushed a farmer.
Guiyang Evening News quotes: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, citing his surname Wu.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that broke the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked away from attacking other people and kept until the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating death compensation.
Although few, human-infested pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, a 295-kilogram pig squeezed a Welsh farmer into a tractor and pressed it until the animal was taken away by his wife.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that aggressiveness can be driven by the taste of blood.
“They’re just playful.
They like to bite, very curious... not inclined to harm anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,” he said.
Hurricane Rose 'remains' will bring heavy rain to the US southwest
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
From 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Cap Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
At the same time, an extended low-pressure area on the Pacific side begins to form and moves eastward, toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to carry a large tropical moisture north, to the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching extended low-pressure area, will bring widespread rainfall to the southwest in the coming days.
Instead, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flow and possible debris in the desert.
High tropical humidity in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, will cause 5 to 8 centimeters of rainfall per hour.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in southwestern regions, especially large parts of Arizona.
Due to the nature of the tropical rainfall, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
In the face of tropical storms, a particularly bad idea would be to be dragged into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain canyons can be turned into raging rivers, and a storm would cause wind and dust sweeps.
The approaching extended low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to the southern coast of California.
More than 1 centimeter of precipitation is expected, which can cause a small flow of debris, and roads can become slippery.
This would be the first wet season in the region.
Some of the tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread across Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a great example of the huge differences in temperatures in the central United States.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) are nearly 20 degrees apart from St. Louis and Di Moino (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the summer heat is expected to rise again and cover more places.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., from the Great South Plains to the northeastern regions, it is expected to arrive in a warm October with a high temperature of 27 degrees.
The temperature in New York is expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that temperatures in the eastern United States will be higher than the average multi-year temperature in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bretto Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched six television broadcasts on Thursday to pay close attention to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's remarks and the accusations of sexual violence in the 1990s by woman Christine Blasey Ford.
But the political stalemate continued after broadcasters interrupted regular programming due to Friday's last-minute change: an Arizona senator drafted a deal to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was drinking at a high school party, had grabbed her and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh testified with indignation that he was absolutely certain that it was not.
Nielsen said on Friday that more than 20.4 million people had watched the show.
The company estimated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the number of people watching TV in the offices.
To make matters more understandable, it is an audience of the same size as would be formed during the replays of football matches or the Oscars.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose executives strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, ranked first of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest even after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning when protesters shouted at him as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN filmed him directly with his eyes down when he was flooded by people.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would have more to say at the court committee meeting.
Subsequently, cable television and broadcasting networks discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted in favor of Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the candidate's accusations over the next week, which were called for by a minority of Democrats.
Flake, speaking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partly convinced.
After speaking with Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake’s choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Accuses Critics of 'Playing Politics' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her plans to leave the European Union critics "playing politics" with Britain's future and to harm the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on the front page of the newspaper after her photo, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called “Brexit” plan of “stakeholders” that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs, saying it was “absolutely absurd.”
Wayde Sims shot dead, police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player’s death
Police have arrested a person suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the Sims and Simpson clash, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the clashes.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson’s DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the security deposit for his release is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Service of Experts released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a shot to the head, diverted to the neck.
The department awards the merits to the Louisiana State Police Escape Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police, and the residents of the district who assisted in the investigation that led to the suspect's arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the district’s law enforcement for “scrupulousness and enforcement of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the youngster scored an average of 5.6 points during the game and caught a 2.6 rebound.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "stunned" and "shocked".
“You think about it all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano explodes in ash in Mexico City
The ashes erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano that reached the surroundings of the southern Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when crater activity was detected and gas and ash emitted 183 times in 24 hours.
The centre has witnessed a number of earthquakes and quakes.
The social media photos show a thin layer of ash-covered car windshields in Mexico’s surroundings, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysicists have noted that volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital increased when a 7.1-point earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Donu Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Before the independence vote, the annual police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's opposition to the secession vote.
Masquerade separatists were stopped by riot police with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The police used sticks to stop the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, the independence group singing "Unforgettable, Unforgivable" clashed with unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but which is being chanted by Catalan separatists, tensions in the independence region remain high.
A majority of voters chose to become independent, but due to a large number of voters boycotting the vote, voter turnout was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police across the region tried to stop voting in the electoral districts.
Independence groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police force.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciso Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
“I watched my parents cheerfully shout that they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a vital and hard-to-reach victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s independence parties have had a hard time keeping pace this year, with many of their best-known leaders reluctantly retreating to voluntary exile and being held in exile.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Candidacy for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonder. Detained men entering the house by car
Three 33, 34 and 39-year-old men were arrested after being re-entered in a Londonder house by car.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been shot with an arbalète.
Mengo's strike secured Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Moved to the top, Livingston surprised the Rangers by forcing Ibrox club manager Steven Gerrard to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Meng's hit proved to be very important because in a moment, Gary Holt's team was compared to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains a loser in the Premier League this season and will meet with the leaders of the Hearts next Sunday, from which they are behind by eight points.
Before that on Thursday, the Rangers played a European League match at home with Vienna's Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its unrivalled unbeaten series in the division to six, and head coach Holt has not yet tasted defeat, as Kenny replaced Miller only last month.
Livingston misses out on chances in games with regulars
Even before scoring a goal, Holt’s team had long been ahead of the Rangers due to their persistence in raising a variety of issues.
At first, Scott Robinson burst and knocked across the goal, then Alan Lithgow slipped, unable to reach Craig Halkett's head, and the ball landed next to the goal.
The hosts, letting the Rangers play at the front, were not worried because they knew that they could cause problems for guests by creating standard positions.
That’s how a decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston began to push forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly handed the ball over to Meng, who stopped him and scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the Rangers have controlled the ball for a long time, but the defense of the hosts was insurmountable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had hardly any work to do.
Such a vague game continued in the second lift, although Kelly had to work in support of Alfredo Morelos's knock on the goal.
Scott Pittman's goalkeeper, Allan McGregor, kicked the leg off the Rangers, and after the next Livingston standard position, the Lithgow-sent ball flew past the goal.
The handed-over ball was permanently placed on the Livingston penalty area, but each time it was fired, and two requirements for the penalty – one due to Halkett’s collision with Glenn Middleton, who ran after the change of the pitch, and the other due to the ball’s touching of the hand – were not satisfied.
Analysis of the phenomenal "Livingston" performance
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from the Tony Macaroni arena
Fantastic Livingston game and result.
They were all great to one and continued to exceed expectations for the ever-improving game.
The style of the game and the staff have hardly changed since returning to the top league, but great merits should be dedicated to Holt, because when he arrived, he set the team on fire.
There were a lot of heroes for him.
Superbly played by Captain Halkett, who focused on a well-organized defense, and Menga valued Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose their vigilance.
However, the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
Although they played well under Gerrard, this time they lacked a lot to reach their level.
They made little decisive hits and only once broke through the defense of the hosts. Some anxious call to the team of the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne was met with a number of
On Saturday (September 29th) there were smiles and blue skies when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Leaders argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to accept him in their country.
Different protests indicate a split of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others stream and call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A cyclist died in a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision with a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, around 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, shocked by the culprit, who then fled. This accident occurred about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison: Six officers injured in clashes
The prison service reported that six prison officers were injured during a major riot in a special security men's prison.
The incident took place at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 09.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officers were summoned to control the demolition, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officers are treated for minor facial injuries at the site of the incident.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been called in to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are sure that those responsible will be handed over to the police and, possibly, spend more time outside the grid."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated at the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officers were summoned to prison to control a serious riot, during which some workers were thrown with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its sudden floods (it may be useful for harsh areas)
It's not common for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa with its remaining energy sweeps across the desert southwest and this will lead to a sudden risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already announced a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading toward southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that as the rain approaches late Monday, Rosa will head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status no further than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, and in some areas of Arizona’s Mogolon Rim, the precipitation will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 centimeters, and some can fall down to 10 centimeters.
For people who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the pink rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations can be beneficial as the southwest is currently suffering from droughts.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category,” weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels to the coast across the entire peninsula of California, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equating to a hurricane category with a huge 137 km/h wind, is 619 kilometers south of the cape of Eugenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific region and therefore rebounds.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of the tropical storm on Monday at noon or evening.
Falls falling in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 8 to 15 centimeters is expected, but, possibly, up to 25 centimeters of precipitation,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, then on Tuesday morning, she will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday late evening, through Arizona, she will move towards southern Utah.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very high rainfall on the California peninsula, northwestern Sonoran and southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is believed that these rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods, debris flows in deserts, and debris in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsamer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were detained on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found injured in Somerset.
The teen was found injured in Midsamer Northone’s Excelsior Terrace Zone at around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Eivon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old man, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock district.
Officials have contacted all the individuals who may have any mobile-phone footage of what happened.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “offended by the scorn, anger of the Democratic Party.”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote by which we would like to reject the relentless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a speech in Wilmington, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the scorn, the anger of the Democratic Party” during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday strongly and emotionally denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw that day as Kavanaugh was great, noble and courageous.
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a credible reputation in public service,” he told the West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also talking about the importance of Republican election activity in mid-term elections.
“The most important election in our lives has been five weeks.
“I’m not involved, but I’m really involved,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said Democrats are seeking to “resist and obstruct.”
A senior GOP aide to leaders told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths due to earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of them lighted by huge waves breaking into the beach when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu City Beach Festival on Friday, when waves of six meters high began to hit the coast at dusk, many of them fatally lighted up and destroyed everything that happened on the way.
After the tsunami, there was a 7.5-point earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, said in a news release in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen on its own, it took off cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami was running at 800 km/h.
He said some people climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Natural disaster agency photos from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges curved and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by repeated strikes.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that is home to 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said on Friday that the energy released by the earthquake was about 200 times that of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunami could have intensified due to the geographical location of the city, as it was located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, later added that 540 people were injured and 29 people disappeared without knowing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Nugroho said the communications networks "were completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are going to disaster-affected areas.
It was said that “this could already be considered a tragedy, but the situation could deteriorate even further.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that the tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves arrived after a warning was issued.
In the common social media amateur material, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of the building, who, stubbornly, shouts about the coming tsunami to the people standing down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted the electricity supply, cutting communications networks around Palu, and making it difficult for authorities to coordinate aid.
Authorities said the Jakarta-based army had begun sending cargo planes with relief supplies, but the evacuated people still needed food and other essential supplies.
The airport was reopened only for the purpose of providing assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba said that as World Vision personnel from Dongala travelled safely to Palu city, where workers were crammed into curtain tents built in the office yard, they were accompanied by ruined images along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when the relief teams began to take complex action to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were banned from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and staff recruited from abroad can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said.
“When the government says, ‘Yes, it’s a national disaster,’ we can call for international aid, but that status has not yet been announced.”
On the second night after Friday's quake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that will affect the dark history of natural disasters.
A small boy was taken out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble near her mother's body for two days.
Indonesia national paragliders coach Gendo Subandono has trained as a paraglider in two missing Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandalay, were his students.
“Because I’m older in paragliding, I’m carrying my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon detailed how within hours of announcing the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled through the paragliding sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to the rivals in Palu who participated in the festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue rattlesnakes.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he said.
Newport on the Levee ATM robber steals $26,750 from Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled in an ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center on Friday morning.
“The driver of the car was a cashier at the entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “flew off behind the back of a Brink’s worker” and stole a cash bag to replenish it.
According to the press release, witnesses noticed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the crime.
Any person with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
After announcing the changes to his Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: “A person formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old K. West has been known as Ye for some time now and named his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The show has to replace singer Arianna Granda, who canceled the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional name – West said earlier that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, referring to the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means one, and became simply Ye, which means our good, evil, confusion, reflection of everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Fraternal Love.
West's former colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a comma and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated AMLO) promises not to use soldiers against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military forces against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square "never to use military forces to subdue the population of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, at a time when left-wing student movements began throughout Latin America, representatives of the military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador has solemnly pledged to support young Mexicans every month by subsidizing students and opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities include young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various U.S. government bodies issued reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy at all.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan to lead the way in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are looking forward to another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Doubled funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of artificial intelligence will be the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, investing in one of China's most famous artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranked American player Othello, and later served as head of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said U.S. scientists often have to work hard to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the bright minds of universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. intensify efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced its plan for the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.
In addition, Lee said, China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research per year.
But in the coming months, nothing has been done about the U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor’s name means claims to Greek territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opponents of nationalists say changing the name would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gj<0xC3><0xB8>rge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts about whether voter activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
Referendum question posed on the voting card: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership if you agree to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is worth paying the price for joining institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for us all,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MEPs said they would stick to the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko vote in a referendum held in Macedonia on changing the name of the country to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents that were being built to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not enter through the servants’ door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonians, we can drill into others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that the “yes” result would be “assuring our future.”
According to a poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, 30-43 percent of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, less than the required voter turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma, 57 percent of respondents are preparing to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, 50 percent of voters plus one vote must participate.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious failure of the pro-war government's policy since it took power last May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defense and win goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton, and Manchester City on Saturday, playing at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, scored a 2–0 victory.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, seemingly unbelievably easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the square at the beginning of the attack.
Before breaking out into the open field, he escaped between three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four players wearing green shirts.
He passed through one of the defenders, before overtaking several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he passed the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball from the penalty area with one leg, and the right-footed striker dropped the ball to the right side of the goal net, beating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the head of City, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky to have him scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who helped Sky Blues break out first in these Premier League games.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball while in the depths of Brighton.
Along the left edge of the square between the two opponents, he handed the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane pushed the ball forward with a few levers, while Sterling turned towards the further leg.
The Sky Blues striker dropped the ball to the goal just before slipping out of the square.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group matches at the Zinsheim Arena in Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with the Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the rematch, there were no more compelling reasons to force again.
Competitive, Scherzer hopes to defeat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the rematch; in the West National League, they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, who defeated the Nationals 5:2 on Friday night, at least secured a chance to get a discounted trip, but will still have to make an effort to secure the right to play in the first division.
“While we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to run to the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where crowds and other teams will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you get ready?"
The starting line-up of Sunday's team Nationals has not yet announced, but they are clearly prone to dropping the ball in this case.
Scherzer, who will be 34 in the standings of the match, took a throw-in practice on Thursday and will take a meticulous position on his usual rest day, Sunday.
Washington’s right-hand stats this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 cars over 220 2/3 lift.
Short Speech in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voter activity in the midterm elections, the president indirectly mentions the situation regarding Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we’ve achieved will be put on the scales in November.
There are five weeks left until the most important election in our lives.
“It’s very important, I’m not running... but I’m running, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see how it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how evil.
They don’t care what they’ve hurt, what they’ve slipped through to get power and control; that’s what they really want—power and control—but we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “ugly, ugly, low-minded and wrong people.”
He cited the Senate Judiciary Committee as a reference to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused huge ovations.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Yeah, um, like.
No, um... no, I’m waiting for one – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour has lost its diversity of views.
They do not tolerate openly expressing their opinions.
When momentum activists in my local party voted for mistrust of me, I wondered if it was necessary to be surprised.
Finally, I am the latest of the Labour MPs to be told that I am undesirable, and this is for my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar threats because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was disbelieved when I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on European, ironic, on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that "we want many members to be involved in the meetings and that the meetings are productive."
For most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour MP, Friday night’s GC meetings have been exactly like that.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if it has ever been implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and each opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues, whose political views, as I had previously believed, are similar, began to expect me to turn around at a 180-degree angle and follow opinions I would never agree with, whether for national security or for the sake of the EU.
Whenever I speak in public – and no matter what – on social media, there is an investigation of insults that encourage my cancellation, condemn the policy of the centre and say that I do not have a place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I was much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I made are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things of this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with each “disbelief” procedure or change in the electoral system, this party becomes smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that encourages me to stay calm, not speak so loudly, and then with me, “everything will be fine.”
But I didn’t come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which in the real sense of the word led to the collapse of the whole class of my school, I have sought to win better public services for those who are most in need of their ministers, whether they are local or not.
I have never hid my policies, including the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East should have been in any way surprised by my political views and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country moves towards Brexit, which will affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, one message I have from Nottingham Momentum to my constituents, Labour Party members (whether or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of cancellation or political purpose will stop me from acting according to my beliefs and the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 Invincible Ayr conquers table tops
Two late trials slightly distorted the final results, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to have won this impressive moment in the promising Tennent’s Premiership game.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one unmatched.
Ultimately, the victory brought them impeccable defense and well-exploited opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've put up all the tests in all the matches that have taken place so far and we're still unmatched, so I'm really happy," he said.
"Robyn Christie of Melrose said, 'Ayr looked good, the players took their chances better than we did.'
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, successfully completed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but the yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, released to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to pick up the numbers, while Bagyvgot did not stop.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty when before, in the middle of the match, he scored points and successfully completed the personal test, helping Ayr to unlock before the break with a score of 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second round well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The game was suspended for a long time as Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was taken out of the clearing on a stretcher. After the prolonged match, Ayr continued to move forward when Stafford McDowall successfully completed Climo's attempt.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose attempted to take advantage of the players' excess, but Bruce Colvin's attempt was unsuccessful at the end of the fierce pressure.
The home team player returned, but after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pushed the ball off the penalty line for the remaining Ayr wrestling spots.
Climo successfully completed his trial, as he had done almost since the start of the rematch, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's leaning on the corner of the square and prevented the frontier striker Gregor Henry from arranging his fifth home team try to win.
Still Game star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems to be ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector after it turns out that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writing and starring alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craigslist.
Officially, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the fact, though Scottish Sun sources said Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business."
"We own the sea": Bolivia imprisoned on land expects court to reopen the way to the ocean
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Pase.
The blue flag of the ocean flies on public buildings.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is decorated with the motto: “We legally own the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
Across landlocked Bolivia, memories of access to the ocean, which had to be sacrificed to Chile in the bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, are still alive and longing to be revived in the Pacific.
The hopes that have been nurtured in recent decades have now been greatly strengthened, with Bolivia awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which will be announced on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia is focused on a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will watch the announcement of the ICC decision on big screen, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will make a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s state access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian Indian president awaiting a controversial election battle for re-election, is also keenly interested in what will end Monday's decision.
“We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will make a favorable decision for Bolivia, even if it did, little would change.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to override Chile’s territory and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will be announced only six months after the last arguments were heard hardly indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, an expert on international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to push back a little bit, the last four years could have pushed it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s goodwill have been destroyed by Morales’s vengeful rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will extend the talks at some point, but after all this, it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
“On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea issue as political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never renounce the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can be trusted by the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assured that his people would never give up nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises agreed by the leaders of the competing countries during the meeting in Singapore.
His remarks came at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be planning to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri says the "utopian dream" is that if the sanctions continue and the United States renounces the declaration on the end of the Korean War, North Korea could be crushed at some point.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration unless Pyongyang takes convincing disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is not serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country seems to see as the sole guarantor of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for Kim and Trump's second meeting.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headwear, and they will quickly conquer the nearest fashion stores
If you want to complement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is right for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large headwear in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and he simply stunned viewers at Paris Fashion Week in his style.
These particularly impractical hats conquered the social network Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching creations on the podium.
The highlight of Valentine's work was a huge hat of body color, decorated with a wide, feather-like edge, enveloping the head of the dummy.
Other non-standard-sized accessories were gem-studded watermelon, wizard’s hat, and even pineapple – but they weren’t designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – at the same time as Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn on lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of the pieces looked like a member suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other reminiscent of a melted ice cube.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, you won’t ask.
Style experts speculate that these huge covers can get into the stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two-footed edges were worn by everyone - from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand, having created extremely impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a sandy beach bag, almost the same size as a swimsuit-to-wear dummy.
The red brick raffia bag, decorated with raffia corners and white leather handle, became the exclusive accent of the Jacquemus collection "La Riviera SS19" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores next summer because the designer made such a big impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories.”
John Edwards: “Language is a very important skill for the citizens of the world”
Scottish independent schools have improved academic achievement records without dropping in 2018 and have once again demonstrated outstanding exam results, which have only been further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community-based achievements.
With a total of more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to be global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can design and implement the planned school curriculum, we see that contemporary languages continue to be popular and readily accepted in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you can speak to a man in a language he understands, he will understand you in his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, speak to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to knit relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we can say that languages are at the peak of popularity and have the best maintenance ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A-rating.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of learners received the highest A rating in German, as well as 63 percent of learners received the highest A rating in Spanish, and 69 percent of learners received the highest A rating in English.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign language proficiency to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered as important as core subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of all the reasons why employers found it difficult to fill jobs were insufficient language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
As employment opportunities will be highly language-dependent in the future, these skills are becoming essential in a globalizing world.
No matter what career a person chooses to learn a second language, in the future he will be far superior to others if he has these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person who learns several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of 15 percent of people, i.e.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages in which it is taught.
Many schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others are taught languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK, looking to the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to create an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, and therefore it is necessary to reflect this in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity of choice, diversity and results to Scottish youth.
This must be done.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans can’t wait to see LeBron James start the Los Angeles Lakers season.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James will play in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets at San Diego.
Exactly how many minutes you play is not yet clear.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Short speech in West Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign this evening in West Virginia, Illinois.
This is the first of five planned Trump speeches next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval of the suspension procedure for the nomination of his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Trump is seeking to focus support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans threatened to lose control of Congress in November.
Is there a Trump speech in West Virginia this evening and how to watch it online?
Short Speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the following broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to touch on Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week because she has sown a lot of tension over suspicions of sexual misconduct when the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for a week before the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength as the November election approaches.
President Trump’s campaign officials say the five meetings next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the very hot campaign season starts,” Trump said in a statement.
"Willing's planned Wesbank Arena speech this evening should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," the West Virginia Metro News said in a statement.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is polled to be at the bottom of the rankings.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to get him to the top of the rankings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: The U.S. team is ready for war and hopes to get into Sunday’s unit competition
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the four could be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation in success is completely fictitious, but the players really believe in it, especially in such competitions as this one.
So on whose side is success now?
"They came first with six points, and now with four points, so I guess we can count it on some sort of success," Spieth said in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe leads, has a four-point lead and is still waiting for twelve matches.
The enthusiasm of the Americans, Spieth says, has faded, and they do not lack it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from start to finish and flawlessly first.
As the round went on, the wild screams of victory became more and more famous. To finish the fourth match on an equal footing, Thomas scored two points out of two possible.
His blow, which earned them a win in the match at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar rumours, which seemed to say that the end of the American team was not yet in danger.
“You just have to concentrate and take care of your own games,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players is left to play separately.
By the end of the day, there are 18 holes.
The only players who have scored more points for Spieth and Thomas over the past few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couple from Europe collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple that didn’t need extra hits not only on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
This turn of events and the reaction of the cheering spectators only confirms that they will be the players who win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, after the last rays of the sunset, have secured the "Le Gal Golf National" field.
It would be good to have both at the same time in different pits.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern four-ball hero when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An extra punch and two double extra punches in the first nine holes pushed the Spaniards and the Swedes into trouble, from which they were never able to get out.
No one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four balls and four matches are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between pairs, because of the advice they give and don’t give, and because the strategy can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team, so it came to the final decisively, but this stage of the fourth also showed that the U.S. team has a fighter's back, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
The last day of the Ryder Cup Europe leads 10:6
Europe will face off against the United States on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after the fourth stage of Saturday's 10:6.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to warm the atmosphere by winning two victories against hard-fought Tiger Woods and leading Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European side, in order to save the trophies he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the unsuccessful American side in the morning quarters and finished the stage 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarterfinals when it won two matches but failed to overcome the points lead
Jim Fury’s side needs eight points from 12-unit matches on Sunday to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row when Mollinari and Molliwood doubled after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they smashed trust-losing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better score of 5:4.
Woods, who hasn't beaten two Saturday games so much, has shown a high level of professionalism at times, but has already lost 19 and 29 games in his four-match series, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose<0xCA><0xBC> rested in the morning quarters and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the quarters; they defeated 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranking first and third in the world rankings.
Despite a pleasant, gentle windy day in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not feel like butter.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raised the Americans' cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they defeated Spain's Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter 2-1, while in the fourth match, they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3, without scoring the ball in the first two pits.
Only twice in Ryder's history did the team manage to reclaim a four-point lead in single-match matches, even though Furyk's half had enough equals to keep the trophies.
While the two days were in second place, on Sunday, luck seemed to turn away from them.
North Korea says it will in no way arm itself unilaterally, unable to be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen their mistrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test base and committing not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not received a similar response from the United States,” he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally arm ourselves."
While Mr. Ri repeated North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea for taking steps, his statement drew on the fact that he did not completely reject the idea of a more bilateral disarmament.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump during the first meeting of the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump vowed to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is pursuing a formal end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also refusing to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States is demanding nuclear disarmament first and is increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by means of coercive means, even by waiving the declaration of an end to the war,” he said.
“To think that sanctions can hit us is the same thing as having utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump meeting, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If the other country on this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea, not the United States, the nuclear disarmament issue of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this conclusion."
However, the tone of Ri's speech has changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "the master of missiles" in preparation for a suicide mission, North Korea's missiles were not directed at all at the U.S.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea fulfilled its nuclear demand.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable, saying that "if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have said that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must be resolutely continued without any concessions until the full and definitive evidence-approved nuclear disarmament is accomplished.”
The Security Council has voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to clear the ground for the next meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying all the progress was just for North Korea to announce after a few hours that he had made "gangster demands."
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
Kim said the "appropriate measures" he was pursuing are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a shift towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest Enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more, aiming to combat the growing culture of cats in studies, caffeine consumption, and sleepless nights.
One academic found that at the best university in the world, students often don’t even have the basic knowledge to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham City, a specialist in women’s hospitals, has prepared a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in my final year of school?’
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important habits of quality sleep help to achieve academic and sporting results, improve general well-being.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University’s Department of Health Services, Paul Barreira, said the university decided to offer this course when it turned out that students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section features a photo of the dormitory room where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, exercisers, and books to learn about caffeine, the effects of light, how sleep deprivation affects sports results, and the importance of a walking sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Student campus map with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their day-to-day routine.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we think they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying awake overnight, he says, still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to the growing problem of sleep deprivation.
“Ensuring enough and high-quality sleep should be a student’s secret weapon in combating stress, exhaustion, and anxiety,” he said, “even avoiding weight gain because lack of sleep switches the brain to fasting mode, making students constantly feel hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare a course when last year, in his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the subjects he taught.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course accessible to the entire student campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to listen to this course before starting to attend this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock when it’s time to go to sleep, just like waking up, and to beware of the damaging effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light-emitting LEDs, as they can be beaten by your circadian rhythm halfway through.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to beat Steven Gerrard's weakened score of 1:0.
Ibrox had hoped to earn its first victory on the run-off after a 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt’s team defeated Gerrard for the second time in an 18-match lead, and now the latter team is already eight points behind the long-running Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration, the Rangers saw no way to equalize the score.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third and are behind Hibernian with only one goal.
And Rangers’ worries don’t end there, as the butter item probably hit the head of side judge Calum Spencer from the troughs and hurt him.
Gerrard made four moves that allowed Ayr to overtake and led to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same elf, who took a point from Hearts last week, and would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations would have reassured opponents at every turn.
The Rangers dominated controlling the ball, but having it at Livingston did more.
They could have scored in the second minute when Menga struck the ball close to Allan McGregor's goal-breaking Scott Pittman, but security destroyed his chance by pointing the ball away from the goal.
After a long free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his assistant defender, Alan Lithgowas, crossed the country.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was just a game of hope, not faith.
For the remaining fifteen minutes, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson handed in the Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to hit only twice in the first lift, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was scarcely frightened by Lassana Coulibaly’s head-stroke or the gentle pairing of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34-minute goal may not have matched the course of the game, no one will dispute that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers were once again unsuccessful in overcoming Jacobs's blind defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who retained the title and handed it over to Meng for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately yielded fruit when the country's security team played Morelos, but Kelly's impressive play after running back restrained the strike.
Livingston brought guests into a game they loved, with far-reaching passes from the Lithgowo and Halkett ball.
Holt's team was able to increase their preponderance in the end, but McGregor defended from Jacobs' strike after Lithgow's drop from the corner.
After switching to the pitch, Rangers player Glenn Middleton appealed for a penalty once again at the end of the game after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: on September 30, 1882, today it is already 136 years ago and MORE... That day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention, according to which a device was later developed, known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a hit in the scientific world, and later in popular culture, when the 1950 film Bells of Coronado starred non-cowboy-like scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can actually hear how the atoms work, touched by the radioactive effects in the minerals."
Evans: “Hey, now it’s really shooting!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that was named after him is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to See Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to See Bad Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognize bad cells – it’s part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then “see” the proteins characteristic of many cancers, and are re-injected back.
The trial vaccine has produced many promising results in the treatment of patients with various cancers.
One woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, had ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins characteristic of HER2 type cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells are extracted from patients and learned to adapt to cancer cells, has been successfully adapted to treat leukaemia.
Kanye<0xCA><0xBC>as West released a supportive tirade for Trump, wearing a MAGA cape, after his appearance on the SNL show.
I hope it doesn't end
After an indiscriminate performance on Saturday Night Live, spectators humiliated Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, by shouting, saying he was taking part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town" that night, which featured a hoodie that reads "Make America Great", he continued to condemn Democrats and voiced support for Trump.
“How many times have I had to talk to white people, they said, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if racism were a cause for concern, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, filmed footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make West laugh at this recording.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had inconveniences behind the scenes due to his head covering.
“They mocked me behind the scenes.
He said don't go there with a hat like that.
They made fun of me!
They said I had reached the bottom," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see what the bottom is?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I have my superman’s steak and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
“Begin to love.”
His remarks sparked at least twice disapproving voices in the audience, and members of SNL broadcasting seemed embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One man told the media: "The whole studio was dominated by deadly silence."
West was asked to urgently replace singer Ariane Grande after her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West impressed many with his performance, during which he performed the song "I Love It", wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from conservative group TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest men of spirit: THANK YOU FOR MY REMEMBERING.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just himself and that’s amazing.”
“But I choose not to kill a man (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his ‘art’) whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first creator to change his name, but he has followed the same path that Diddy has already taken, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lion; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after knife attack in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempting to kill a man who was stabbed in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Star of The Seventh Wars, Next Harrington Criticizes Distorted Approach to Manhood
Another Harrington became famous as the sword-chewing character John Snau in the HBO fantasy adventure series about the Middle Ages Wars.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the macho hero. He claims that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Another said that he believes “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to combat the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married 31-year-old Star Wars star Rose Leslie, admitted that the topic "strongly touches him."
“I feel like this topic is really touching me now. Where did we make the mistake of cultivating masculinity?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he asked.
“What do we teach growing men to face such problems?”
Another believes that part of this distorted masculinity wave could be caused by television, because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they have to be masculine?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time – how can we change this?
It is clear that we made a mistake with the young men somewhere.”
In an interview, he also confirmed that he would not be taking part in any prehistoric or sequel to the Sesto Wars when the series ends next summer, and said that "he's had enough of battlefields and horses."
From November, Next will be filming Sam Shepard's "True West" in a modern version. It is a film about a film director and his brother a robber.
The actor recently unveiled the best thing that happened to him in the making of the Star Wars, where he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so in this sense the show gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose portrayed Playing Another Character, John Snow, as the object of love.
The couple married in June 2018 on a property owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, the infection infected more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, and this is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Jun'an province.
However, over time, the number of people living in China with HIV infection and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men are ultimately married to women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protection measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as one way to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked Republican senator's data, denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied suspicions that one of her employees posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia’s lawmakers’ pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed the allegations were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and yet another despicable lie,” Waters said on Twitter.
According to the report, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrino Hatcho, both from Utah, were both home addresses and phone numbers.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at a time when allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh were being heard in the Senate.
The leaked information appeared a little later when these three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address from which the source of these records was identified relates to the Waters office and information was disclosed to a Waters employee," the Capitol said.
“These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been affected by these deceptive and false suspicions is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded suspicions are utterly false and absolute lies.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-esteem to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be defending himself.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is taking part in a midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"True, if not a lie," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters claimed that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the organizers are cleared up, that they are legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all, without exception to my employees.”
Review of the comedy "Johnny Inglesh hits again" - the exhausted spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit hints in any British film. The same can be said about the revival of the action-spy comedy franchise "Johnnis Ingli<0xC5><0xA1>as" - "Johnnis Ingli<0xC5><0xA1>as" was started to be shown in 2003, and in 2011 "Ingli<0xC5><0xA1>as" began to appear on the screen.
Will this sarcastic autosatisfaction about how obviously we got together become a new opportunity for national exports?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglesh has a second chance to bring unpleasant truths to the surface with his wide-eyed and rubbery face <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> for the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy work is intended for non-English-speaking regions of the cinema.
Of course, this silly secret agent, who, although he has claims to luxury, also acquired a bit of Inspector Clouseau's qualities, a bit of Mr. Byn's traits and a slug similarity to that guy, alluded to in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He is also a bit based on a character about a traveler and a mysterious man causing the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are a few beautiful moments in this latest Johnny Ingles movie.
I liked it when Johnny Inglesh approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the walnut rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exaggerated and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible boldly incorporate elements of comedy.
Humor is more for children than for adults, and the adventures of Johnny English, which I have never seen before, do not seem as ingenious and calm as Atkinson’s silent jokes of Mr. Byne.
At the moment, the most common issue is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cybercriminal has successfully hacked into Britain’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent’s outrage – an overly insignificant role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the cup of the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is already suffering from staggering political unpopularity: Emma Thompson, a character depicting Teresa May, squeezes out everything she can, but in the script there is not much good material for it.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to search for people among those who have retired.
This means that you have to turn to Johnny Inglesh himself, who is currently working as a school director at some fancy institution, but who gives illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when Inglesh offered a School of Rock type Academy.
Inglesh is sent back to Whithol to discuss the emergency and meets for a long time with his co-star Bough, who again plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a man associated with the captain of a submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-ranking girl, seems to be under-exploited.
So Batman and Robin, able to mess everything up in Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet Olga Kurylenko's fatal beauty Ophelia Buletova.
The prime minister is dangerously shaken by a charismatic billionaire who claims he can solve the problem of British computers, the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
Inglesh and Bough start their odyssey: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury Volta yacht, and Inglesh starts a total anarchy, trying to take advantage of virtual reality headphones to get acquainted with Volta's interior.
All the stops were clearly supported by this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it is, it all sounds a lot like children's television.
Pretty average.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t get rid of the thought: Isn’t the British film industry able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would certainly be worth his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to create a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
It is reported that the party wants corporate leaders to share the savings accumulated due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving its employees one day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home a salary of the same size.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to steer the country’s development in a positive direction for the workers.
The transition to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is consistent with the party’s approach to economic balance for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Greens also promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow government spokesman, John McDonnell, took the opportunity at last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “faceless dictators” and “for-profit hunters” in utilities.
Such shadow chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their full share, because the Labour government can deduct something if it sees the harm done.
It also approved plans to include employees on the company’s board of directors and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10 percent of private sector companies’ capital would be transferred to employees, and they could receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are answering the 60 Minutes question about whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
When the FBI investigated the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on whether to appoint him to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week, the question arises whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of some Republican senators in a way that they did not rely on this right.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent on 60 Minutes, asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FBI finds out something that will change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said at the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these accusations appeared, I called him and asked, “Did you do that?”
He responded decisively, firmly, unambiguously.”
So Mr Graham's views would seem to change nothing.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, there should be really shocking accusations," he said.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one can confirm what he says.
36 years have passed.
I don’t think there will be anything new.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it contributed to poverty alleviation?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and aiming to end poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of the Central Park Grand Prairie, the World Citizens’ Festival will host tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also spread the message about the real goal of the event – to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens’ Festival was launched in 2012. It is a continuation of the World Poverty Action Project – an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), concert attendees had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the world leader, calling the phone or in some other way aiming to raise their awareness meaningfully.
But do the citizens of the world achieve this goal successfully? There are 12 years left until the deadline.
Will the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Perhaps this is just another example of so-called clickivism, fictitious activism – people think it will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens’ Festival, since 2011, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its sponsors, which encourage the realization of a wide variety of goals.
They say that under the pressure of these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policy strategies that aim to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and statements prompted by the group’s actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
According to the group, almost 649 million people worldwide have already been directly affected by the funds secured.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, an investor-executor partnership in the UK that aims to “help children grow and unleash their full potential.” More than 4,700 U.S. citizens have been challenged by the U.S. on Twitter.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments of countries and like you, citizens of the world, we can achieve that social injustice such as nutritional insufficiency become a thing of the past,” said Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman, who attended the 2018 London Concert.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the “Nutrition Power” project, where nutrition interventions will reach 5 million women and children.
On your website, in response to one of the FAQs that asks “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The citizens of the world respond: “It is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Says U.S. May Use Navy Blockade to Stop Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary, Washington can use the navy to hamper Russian energy access to markets, as well as the Middle East markets,” said U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke says Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially when it operates at the behest of legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think Russia is intervening in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this through the Navy, it can ensure that the sea routes are open, and it can, if necessary, make a blockade, it can make sure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke told attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He then compared Washington’s methods to those used in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser counterweight to replace fuel,” he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements emerged as the Trump administration’s mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia on the market, offering Europe’s consumers a much cheaper option.
Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the seemingly inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is purely economic, an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position received a hostile reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow bilateral agreements.
"I certainly do not agree with a third country's interference in our energy supply affairs," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president in 2020.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in the Hall of Fame in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
“It’s a year for women to go to Washington to manage our fallen powers, they have to go to the top,” she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election."
During a meeting at the city hall, Warren nominated President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very frightened by the way Donald Trump treats our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that “an FBI investigation is undoubtedly needed before the vote.”
But a poll released on Thursday shows that the majority of Warren state voters themselves believe she should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not take part in the election.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick is getting more support: 38 percent support his possible candidacy, and 48 percent oppose it.
Others discussed the possible nomination of prominent Democrats in 2020 – former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make the official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at Donald Trump's meeting about Track Palin's post-traumatic disorder
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq while serving in the military in September.
He was arrested and charged in connection with an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“I see what my son is going through, what he is facing when he returns to everyday life, so I understand the other families who are feeling the consequences of the post-traumatic disorder, and some of the injuries our soldiers are experiencing when they return,” she told the crowd at Donald Trump’s rally in Tallahassee, Ohio.
Palin called his arrest an avoidable truth. She said that the son and other veterans of the war "come back with a little change, they come back with a harder heart, they come back with doubts about whether they will receive respect for what their comrades are their soldiers and all the soldiers at the
He was arrested on Monday in Washley, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as charges of obstructing reporting on domestic violence with a gun and indiscretion, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Washley police department.
18 States and District of Colombia Support Resistance to New Asylum Seekers Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing to provide asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the county made remarks to the amicus curiae (court adviser) to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policies, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" raped her, but U.S. officials on July 20 rejected her application for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace-supporting state lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the U.S. receives many asylum applications as states harassed by persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the Immigration Appeals Board’s 2014 decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “is inconsistent with decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be made taking into account the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in a statement.
In this note, lawyers also argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the country are damaging the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “provide the necessary employment services.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to those fleeing domestic violence and gang violence victims.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or certain political views," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
The granting of asylum has never been aimed at solving all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Two-fold increase in death toll in Palu, desperate search for survivors
The situation of the remaining survivors continues to deteriorate.
"The tension is very high," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, reassuring her baby's son, who was taken into custody by the city's evacuation centre.
“Fast cars are transporting more and more people.
Lack of clean water."
It has been observed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect water-soaked items, try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5-point earthquake hospitals have been damaged.
Some of the wounded, like Dwi Harry, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were placed outside the Palu Army hospital – patients in the hospital are treated outdoors for continued severe relapses.
His eyes are filled with tears as he relates how he felt a severe earthquake in the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save others.
It seems to me that I walked across the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to attend the weddings.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, and I kept quiet.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of terrifying propaganda
A week after the official Chinese newspaper spread a four-page ad in the US newspaper, citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited China Daily's paid appendix to Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of influencing the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
“Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China,” U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to stimulate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, and both countries are racking up tariffs on each other’s goods.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China’s counter-tariffs were applied to exporters in Iowa and similar states who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a longtime governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China was "further ridiculed by pressing propaganda ads in our free press."
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s respected freedom of speech and press and ordered a paid promotional post on the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
“In the meantime, you won’t find any conflicting voices in the local Beijing press kiosk, and you won’t create a real picture that reflects the differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, because the press is underneath the strong Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Branstad also added that "one of China's best-known newspapers turned away from the offer to print" his article, but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As midterm elections approach, Kavanaugh’s fiasco has deterred Republican voters
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with several charges of sexual harassment, an analyst has warned that this will get a negative response during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion of the situation is particularly strong, and many Republicans are already officially saying they want to carry out the vote.
Such things cannot be taken away later," said Grant Reeher, a professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute call for an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it both tomorrow and in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.
Protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate lobby, when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s appearances, kzip reported to Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will spread across the country,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst, told the news website.
“People say she’s already been strong, and they’re right.
But it could further strengthen the positions, especially between the indecisive women voters in the suburbs and the under-age 18-29 voters, who, while dislike the president, often simply don’t vote.”
Even before Ch.B. Ford made public statements when she detailed allegations of sexual harassment of a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans approved the candidacy, it could cause resentment.
“This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party,” former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote, it’s not just about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, it’s about how the Republicans handled the situation and how he handled Mr. Ford,” Guy Cecil, a member of Priority USA, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to believe after the statements of Mrs Kavanaugh and Mrs Ford, although she receives a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or probably believe in Ford’s statements, while 35 percent say they fully or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was a true or likely liar in giving evidence, and only 30 percent said the same about Mr Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and the allegations of at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford swore an oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, claiming that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University in the 9th grade.
The inventor of the web plans to establish a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook.
The inventor of the global network, Tim Berners-Lee, is creating a new startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor, Inrupt, is a company whose work is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to which information they have access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to take over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up.
It’s a historic moment.”
The app, based on Solid technology, allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
As if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and which information can be accessed.
The company calls this the empowerment of an individual through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team disagreed with Facebook or Google over changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a statement, Berners-Lee said, “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the durability and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel tremendous optimism about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
The Honourable Bernard Vannas – Priest awarded with the Victorian Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only Anglican church clergyman to be awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter was honored in his hometown.
Colonel Lieutenant Pastor Bernard Vann won the award during the attack on Belengliz and Lucerne on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastors were shot by a sniper, so he remained unaware that he was awarded the highest level of the British army award.
During the parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren unveiled the memorial stone.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone 100 years after the grandfather’s award-winning work was “surprisingly symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kent Canal "with a very dense fog, severely setting off conditions and machine fires."
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and "extremely galantly" led the line forward, and then he himself attacked the situation and killed three squad fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something he would never compare to, but at the same time humility was a very inspiring thing."
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann laid the crown.
Michael Vann said it was a great honor for him to attend the parade, adding: "A true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA enthusiasts didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to meet "Pig Pepa"
Imagine: you don’t go to sleep all night to see the Bellator 206 drought, but in the end you don’t get to see the main sight.
There were 13 fights on the San Jose poster, six of which were on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night through Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, British viewers were astounded by the film “The Pig Pepa” after the broadcast was interrupted.
Some spectators, to put it gently, were not impressed, because it was because of this fight that they did not sleep until dawn.
On Twitter, one of the victims called the replacement of the broadcast with a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
"According to the rules set by the authorities, such content is inappropriate at 6 a.m., so it was necessary to turn on the children's program," Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication Dave Schwartz said in a statement.
"Yes, "Pig Pepa."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust schedules to viewers in the UK.
“When I think of repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it,” Cocker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to fix it until Sunday in our time – Monday in their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast changed, a lot of messages were exchanged, which not all were friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it is a matter of authority.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the passionate, but we simply failed.
This is an unsuccessful situation.”
'Desert Island Discs': Tom Daley Feels Inadequate for His Sexual Orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him motivation to pursue success.
The 24th athlete claimed only in primary school that he realized that he was not the same as everyone else.
For the first time on Lauren Laverne’s radio show Desert Island Discs, he claimed to have taken public speaking on gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that being a father was not so important to win the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, quit her job for several months because of the illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine traveling to an uninhabited island, Daley claimed to have grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said, “Even to this day, that sense of insignificance and differentiation has given me the strength to succeed.”
He claimed that he wanted to prove that he was worth it so that he wouldn’t disappoint those around him when they finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The winner of two Olympic bronze medals has become a high-level LGBT activist and, taking part in this year's British Commonwealth Games, took the opportunity to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He claimed to have spoken about it publicly because he believes he was lucky enough to be able to live openly without any consequences, so he would like to give others such hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, Dustin Lance Black, a US filmmaker he met in 2013, was unexpected for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to Delay, when you have experienced so much at such a young age – he was only 14 in his first Olympics and his father died three years later from cancer – it’s hard to meet someone who’s the same age but has experienced the same heights and depths.
When the couple became parents to their son Robert Ray Blacko-Daley in June, Daley’s outlook, he said, had completely changed.
“If you had asked last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me is to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son’s name is the same as that of his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Antoine Daley, his father, did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he intended to watch while sitting in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” Daley said.
A year later, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that I’d dreamed of it all my life – jumping into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song on the show - Heather Small's work "Proud", which reflected his feelings in the preparations for the Olympics and still pleasantly rubs the skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Ph. Mickelson, who lost his form, spent Saturday's Ryder Cup tournament on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for 47 appearances at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will need to improve his form considerably to avoid an unsuccessful celebration.
Dr. Mickelson, who has been playing every two years for the 12th time, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday’s quarterfinals.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, the main winner spent five times the day on the support team, and the rest improved his technique on the pitch in order to correct play-interfering mistakes.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal player on the narrow pitches of Le Gold National, whose long stretch of rough grass is particularly unfavorable to inaccurate strikes.
Also, as if the pitch itself weren’t scary enough, in the ninth match to be played on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will play against the top goal British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the four-point-backed Americans manage to start the next 12-unit games well, the match by Ph. Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but probably could not speak otherwise.
“He understood his role well today, rolled over my back and hugged me by the hand and said he was ready to play even tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He does not lack self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t know he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Fald's record and become the most Ryder Cup-playing athlete.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which is unmatched by his personal record highs.
Dr. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk claims that his presence on the team has also brought intangible benefits.
“He’s fun, sarcastic, thoughtful, he likes to laugh at people and he’s a great guy to be in the team room with,” he said.
“I think it was fun for younger players to compete with him this week, it was good to watch it.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Björn knows that a major overweight could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a major overhaul in the approach of the last Ryder Cup units can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderamoor, where Captain Seve Ballester's team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line with just a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 lead.
“We keep reminding ourselves that we had a big lead in Valderamoa; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderamoa, where we won, but only barely,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 edition win in a 5:3 result.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
We will need all the strength tomorrow.
Go ahead and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, then the game is not finished.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to consistently pursue it.
I’ve always said I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players’ appearance on the challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would not want to run away from myself in any way.
Tomorrow will be a different kind of hair.
Tomorrow, the most important thing will be the individual game – it’s something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything goes well, but when you’re on the pitch alone, you’re testing the limits of your golfing abilities.
This idea needs to be introduced to the players – tomorrow we will have to push everything out of ourselves.
He’s going to have to break up with his partner, and he’s going to have to get everything out of him.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better individually than as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four each.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the last day’s surprises because Brooklyn was on the winning team until Europe performed the Medina miracle and made them losers.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but try to get a quick start – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle machas become very tense.
“We have formed our team accordingly and released the players in a way that we, you know... we’re trying to create some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas will face Rory McIlroy at the top of his game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading the Europeans.
"I chose these guys in this order because I think they will succeed in the whole game," Bjorn said of his choice for the unit games.
The delivery of a new German warship is postponed again
The newest German naval frigate was due to start working as early as 2014 and replace Cold War-era warships, but, according to the local press, they will not be seen until at least next year due to increasingly deteriorating systems and extremely high prices.
According to an army spokesman quoted by Die Zeit, the release of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new frigate ship of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was blurred by the problems that had already taken the ship into disarray.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to incorporate a powerful conditioner, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain secrecy technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance intervals that allow the latest frigates to fly away from home ports for up to two years.
However, due to unending delays in the latest technology, military ships, which are said to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will be obsolete before they can be used.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press cites a number of major software and hardware defects that would have caused the ship to be untrustworthy in a military mission.
Software shortcomings are crucial, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the strength of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that this ship is significantly too heavy – this reduces its efficiency and limits the capabilities of the navy to implement various improvements in the future.
Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be 7,000 tons twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – in addition to the deteriorating technical equipment including the training of the crew – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion).
The recent frigate-stricken problems have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was in fact "lacking suitable ships".
The official said that over a period of time the problems were compounded because the old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at a Scottish highland manor, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
Researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will observe dwarfs, soprano dwarfs, brown earplugs and aquatic bats in the gardens of Wester Ross Invereve.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be deployed, allowing to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and one or another type of activity.
A map and report of the residential areas will then be created, which will help to form a detailed picture of the behavior of the entire landscape.
National Trust for Scotland (NTS) Nature Affairs Advisor Rob Dewar expects the results to reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential area care work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as to find out how best to care for forested areas so that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined.
They are endangered by construction and real estate development works, which have an impact on relocations and the destruction of residential areas.
Wind turbines and lightning are also at risk, as are mustaches, some of the chemicals used to process building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, catching prey during a night hunt helps the ears more than the eyes.
Bats accurately identify the location of obstacles in the path of insects or flight by means of intelligent echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, looks after bats very responsibly.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, check-ups, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only specially designed bat reserve in Scotland in the Threave Manor in Damfries and Galway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Yard keeper David Thompson says the area of the manor is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats in the Threave Manor,” he said.
– We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we still don’t know much about bats, so work here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is crucial to check for bats before starting the area care work, since the accidental destruction of one prey can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Fleas are protected and prohibited from killing, irritating or disturbing them, as well as from destroying their perimeters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Flea Protection Foundation, urged the public to contribute to the rescue of the bat.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t even know how many local species are going.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “liars” and said people were “trying to make a name for themselves.”
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
An attacker of the Portuguese and Juventus clubs is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he then paid the alleged woman $375,000 to silence the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on a live Instagram feed hours after reports of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports and called them “liars.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today is a lie,” the Ballon d’Or laureate said five times, staring at the camera.
They want to use my name to make me famous.
That's normal.
They want to be famous, saying my name is part of my job.
I'm a happy man, it's okay," the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges they have called “an unacceptable publicity of suspicions of private space.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for “moral damages the amount of which corresponds to the significance of this violation – perhaps one of the most serious violations of a person’s rights in the last few years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at Palms Casino and Hotel Apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Nevada Clark County Court, after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal manner.
Mayorga says that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was a "99 percent good man" betrayed by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
The documents say Ronaldo admitted the couple had had sex, but claimed they were contracted.
Mayorga also claims that she contacted police and her injuries in the hospital were photographed, but later she agreed to a non-judicial settlement because of "fear of retaliation" and worried that she would be "humiliated in public."
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to revoke the deal because she still feels traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was crossing from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, having signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract, he joined the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: The UK would forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to Business Secretary Greg Clarke, the United Kingdom would "forever regret losing its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit."
He added that he was concerned about the BBC's statement by Toyota's UK subsidiary that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A Japanese carmaker said a death at the border would result in job losses if no deal was reached.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said Burnastone CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
According to automakers, the most worrisome is the threat posed to the supply chain in the event of a no-contract Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates when needed, with custom-built cars delivering parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a treaty on 29 March, there may be disruptions to the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays in delivering the details or a lack of them.
Toyota said it would not be able to store supplies for more than one day at the Derby plant, so production would stop.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such border checks.”
“We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, would not only allow us to enjoy success today, but also take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“Not only Toyota, but the data from other car manufacturers also shows that it is necessary to continue to use the highly successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say for what time production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is responsible for the union meetings at Unite, said his union members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, if they lose these jobs, they will never return.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed
“As the fight for the Supreme Court candidate continues, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, Trump’s relations with Russia, and the possible interference of the president with justice.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller’s independence, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, in the wake of reports of resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to coincide with the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, and again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox news show on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "His date is not set. It may happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it could be delayed another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report to the press."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: since September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders responded that press conferences rarely take place not because he dislikes TV journalists who are “effect-seeking” but because he added, “I have to agree with the fact that they are seeking effects for viewers.”
He then mentioned that Trump would more often communicate directly with the press.
“The president answers questions more often than any previous president,” she said, adding, without providing any evidence: “We have reviewed this statistic.”
According to Sanders, the press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that this has happened many times in the last few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States."
Short regularly answers questions when leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honorable guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes odd appearance of the president in front of journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Scotland's Health Minister Writes to EU Workers on 'Brexit' Concerns
Scottish health minister NST wrote a letter to EU workers expressing the country's gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued in the summer and are approaching the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has started to prepare faster and for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know that you are all very worried now.
That’s why I wanted to reiterate how I value the contribution of all employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system to the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie, who suffered a head injury, undergoes emergency surgery
The Vanderbilt Commodores lost the game to the Tennessee State Tigers defending champion Christion Abercrombie on Saturday at 31:27, according to Tennessean journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and doctors at the Abercrombie sideline breathed oxygen, then put it on a stretcher and sent it for further research.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris from Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and extent of the trauma," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie has moved from Illinois to Tennessee State and is playing for the first season.
Before leaving the game, he hit five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he hit during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers who buy real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher mark-up fee
Under the new tory plans, foreign buyers buying UK real estate will have to pay a higher signage fee, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risk posed by a successful Corbyn campaign aimed at attracting young voters
Higher marker tax will be taxed on UK tax-exempt persons
The Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers who buy real estate in the UK are going to be taxed at a higher rate, while the extra money received will be used to help the homeless.
The pledge to provide affordable housing and to target high-income people is expected to reduce the risk posed by Jeremy Corbyn’s successful campaign to attract young voters.
An increased marker tax will be imposed on UK tax-exempt individuals and businesses, and the additional money will be allocated to promote the Government’s campaign against homelessness.
The additional fee – paid in addition to the current signage fee, including the rent of higher rates for second homes or homes purchased two years ago – can reach up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it harder for first-time home buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, which is why many of the country’s wealthy and especially the capital’s districts have become ghost towns.
The new strategy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower marker tax to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused major construction companies of supporting high real estate prices by buying land quickly but not using it, and urged May to address Britain’s housing embarrassment by waiving affordable housing quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including lease controls and a no-fault landing ban.
In addition, he wants more power to build new houses to give municipal councils.
May said: “Last year, I said that as prime minister, I will try to bring back the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
This means that we need to deal with our disrupted housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it is not correct that non-residents and foreign-based businesses can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost unrealistic, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to ever be the head of the Scottish national team.
A 42-year-old Scotsman likes the challenge of reviving North-East, which is currently third in the Premier League and three points behind the first-place club.
After taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B team and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportssound.
“When I was a kid, I grew up at Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish squad competitions, and that always attracted me to come back.
This will only happen if I manage the club successfully.’
Before Ross, Sunderland was led by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce<0xCA><0xBC>, Martin O'Neillas, Roy<0xCA><0xBC>us Keane<0xCA><0xBC>, Gus Poyetas and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town bids, the former Alloa Athletic manager says he didn’t feel anxious to start working under such well-known managers at such a large club.
“Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Under the structure and conditions, this club definitely belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to take him there, but maybe it’s only after I’ve returned to the league that I think I’ve worked here successfully.”
Ross' leadership career lasted only three years. Prior to that, he worked as an assistant manager at Dumbarton Club and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He later helped to recover from the third-division Alloa, and the threatened St Mirren club turned the next season into championship winners.
Ross says he is now more satisfied than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical clubs.
“This change must have been radical,” he recalls of the leadership of Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that it was better for me to lead than to play.
That sounds strange, because I succeeded, I made a lot of money and enjoyed satisfactory achievements.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to overcome a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. When I was an adult, I always felt like I was in my horns, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."

Studies have shown that the best time for pints of beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has boosted the income of impoverished British beers, but has made the burden on restaurant chains even more burdensome.
The figures revealed that sales of breweries and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consulting firm, said: “Early sunshine and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championships meant that the trend continued in July as it did in June, when beer revenues would have risen by less than 2.8 percent.
In June, the retail trade in restaurants fell by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The main revenues from the sale of beers and bars were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them increased more strongly than decreased in restaurants.
Although not as badly as restaurant companies, the sunshine has also affected the basic income from the food trade beer.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-ordered beers and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent this month, and food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman of RSM, an analysis firm for the leisure and fitness sector, said: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
With regard to catering establishments, the main factors continue to be the weather and the impact of the most important social and sporting events.
So it’s no wonder that restaurant groups continue to suffer. True, a drop of 4.8 percent in sales over the course of a year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the constant cost-related pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for most of the businesses that receive income from the food trade. Time will show whether the milder temperature felt in August will give the necessary respite."
Total sales growth in beers and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brand-owned networks.

One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some just 11 years old, have social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is increasing.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a primary account
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts and hides them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake Insta pages is growing rapidly, a link to Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored primary account to show their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that the teenage girl insisted, “Rape me.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors’ Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11<0xE2><0x8E><0xAF>18-year-old students have two accounts, with half of those admitting to concealing accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of MDK, said: “The fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them is worrying.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as its director-advisor at the Scottish Sports Council’s annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and chairman. Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity that allows sports leaders to take advantage of the diverse experience she has gained at an international level over the last decade.
"Eilidha has earned a lot of respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global sports community and we have no doubt that her membership in the Scottish Council will bring a lot of benefits to Scottish sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”

He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
I had to work until exhausted, but completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast milk advertising, which compares mothers with cows, received different ratings online
The company that produces breast milk has received different opinions about its advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared to lactating cows.
To mark the launch of the product, described as the world's first silent portable breast enhancement, consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video, which aims to demonstrate the freedom that nursing mothers give us.
In a full carving of hay, four real mothers dance to a sound recording that says, for example, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, here's not the dough, here's my breasts."
The adage goes on to say, "Take it out, take it out, feed it to the babies, take it out, take it out, milk my beauties."
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked an online controversy.
The 77,000-viewed video, which received several hundred comments, received a variety of reactions from viewers, many claiming that it was a snapshot of the dairy industry’s horrors.
“Promoting this product with cows is a very bad decision.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, only after their newborns are taken from them after a few days," wrote one woman.
Elvie's Breast Milk Unnoticed in the Feeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is understood that it traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk for mothers whose babies are not being taken away?”
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the advertisement – one woman admitted that the song seemed to her “very fun”.
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I were still eating.
When I was out of milk, I felt like a cow.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant,” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun ad is for moms who quit milk (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they were all shocked by unnoticeable dairy products fitted with bra.
The campaign’s idea is based on the insight that many breastfeeding women claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s milk does not make any sound, has no wires or pipes, and unnoticedly holds space in the feeding bra – so women can freely move, hold babies, or even leave the house while taking off milk.
Mother’s partner and creative executive Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie’s milk is a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed boldly and provocatively.
When comparing breastfeeding women with dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the cessation of milk and all the challenges it poses, while at the same time having fun and as much as possible showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new dairy will give.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s milk has come to the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski’s collection was demonstrated by the mother of two children on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp near Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has not changed substantially over the past month, but the number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, partly because of the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it harder to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for childcare risks the possibility of staying in the country.
After the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and these data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Chief Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the institution had detained dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
“Almost 80 per cent of these people – guardians or their family members – live in the country illegally, and the majority of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to prosecute these people," said Albence<0xCA><0xBC>as.
According to shelter workers, in order to deal with cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, according to which some children must appear in court within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, as was customary before.
Many will try to defend a request for legal status against an immigration judge not by arriving in person, but by means of a video conference call.
Recognized persons who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can trigger breakthroughs or attempts to escape.
Advocates say this is even more worrying in large institutions such as the Tornil Shelter: due to their size, they are more likely to fail to notice signs that the child is struggling.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can deepen the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home after the war had been raging in the country for eight years.
Muammar al-Assad, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said, according to the Assembly.
In Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to flee their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said Damascus will not stop fighting this holy struggle until we eliminate both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said conditions for their return were good, while accusing some Western countries of spreading unreasonable fear that deters refugees from returning.
“We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive reconstruction aid only when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created the conditions for accelerated political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, he stressed that the agreement provided for clear terms and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meetings of a committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Mouallem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government will participate in the committee – the work of the group should be limited to the revision of the current articles of the constitution, and warned not to interfere.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
According to this logic, in 2020, Trump would be elected unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, his presidency ends sooner with an indictment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s Best Broadcasting Time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best-selling viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
“It’s the fire that attracts people because we don’t understand something,” said Neal Baer, who is the producer of the ABC series “Decedent” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the House of Congress collapsed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of “Only Fun Parts and a Few Unpleasant Truths, How to Secretly Enter a Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked me.
“He said, ‘He’s making me laugh,’” Scovell said.
Chaos is worth having fun.
Of course, unlike other shows on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the ability to unite immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Unwatching is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it’s more than necessary to be an informed citizen when you realize that you’ve been watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses classified data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000 ostrich-skinned jacket.
I’ll never look at Super Mario again.
"His actions are reminiscent of a reality show because every night he throws something at you," <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> about Trump's changing actors and daily plot twists (delay in conflict with N.F.L. or praise for Kim Jong-un) says Wheelhouse Entertainment's Paeonia Montgo, a senior executive.
You can't miss a single series, otherwise you'll be behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, there was 27 degrees of heat and sunlight outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he faded inside and was watching MSNBC on CNN.
He couldn’t open up – certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
“I remember when we once made those crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought this was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

In the tense mid-term elections to the House of Representatives, money is pouring from around
It is no wonder that the congressional district reform, which ended with two members of the House of Representatives attempting to win the same post, flooded Pennsylvania’s 17th district with money.
The recently redesignated suburban Pittsberg county brought Democrat Conor Lamb, a member of the House of Representatives, to the fight – he won his seat in a special election in another county last spring.
Lamb competes with another member of the House of Representatives, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania. A large part of it overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that, in violation of the constitution, the old counties had been forged in favor of the Republicans.
During the March election in the new 17th district, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Democratic Campaign Committee (DKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK) – were backed by campaign finances.
Lamba, Pennsylvania, became famous when a small majority of voters in the 18th congressional district won the widely watched March special elections.
Republicans took the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Politicians have given Democrats such an advantage.
U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then calms down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but had not received a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the Trump Organization’s leadership was overthrown.
“Due to the recent decisions no longer recognised, Taiwan State Department officials have decided to call off the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” U.S. Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million worth of U.S. aid in 2017, as well as drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions for specific individuals, would have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. It was to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending any deliberations on sanctions against El Salvador.
“To show how important the administration is to this meeting, Vice President Mike Pence is now included in the list of speakers at the conference scheduled to take place in mid-October,” the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without announcing any Washington ceremonies or penalties.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which were told by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity is maintained.
Their stories are confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, if his anonymity will be preserved.
Learn the history of
The report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice can still be awaited – his very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, Mueller is questioning whether Trump’s campaign was carried out in secret in cooperation with Russia, which is detrimental to our elections.
If Congress moves to other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution at the same time as he is preparing to stand again before the electorate, and perhaps finally before the commission of governors.
There’s a lot of “if” here, and I’m not saying that Trump’s end is inevitable – just like his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler – it was only necessary for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We were shocked and missed the opportunity to prevent subsequent years of massacres.
History revolves around such fundamental turning points – the unstoppable march of democracy is then accelerated or paused.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such crucial turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man of whom the fate of Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein's troubles began when the newspaper reported that last year an official offered to secretly record the president and discussed his ineptitude to take office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or inaccurate, or if, despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and false evidence, this candidate is assigned to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote in midterm elections for Congress, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy is at risk of a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once housed me as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Shabbat candles on a table with a swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look to our future in a non-optimistic way?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers clash with Rapid Vienna expects optimistic
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, knowing that if they win the impressive races against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they could find themselves in a strong position to leave Group G.
Due to the middle of the road injury, Graham Dorrance was able to appear for the first time this season in the 2-2 finals with Villarreal. But he hopes the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone towards more important goals.
“For us, this was a good result because Villarreal is a great team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended it with that.
Maybe we could have been more specific in the end, but in general the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first set, and we strained in the second and proved who we were the better team.
Thursday will be another important European League evening.
I hope that we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult because in the last race their score was great. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators, we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my injuries, and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that we can now get ahead, forget about last season and play well.”
Fear of pension savings makes women insomniac
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they would like to receive, few spoke about it with family members.
Approximately half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they’re not trying to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide’s life insurance company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not notify your wishes in advance, the family will not be ready to take care of you.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in predicting costs.
Call a financial advisor. The advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to cover these costs for long-term care with a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed-money-worth life insurance certificate, or by insuring your property as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by protecting documents that allow for protection.
appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and make sure that the specialists will respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become ineffective.
Don’t forget the details. Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and takes him or her to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To be prepared, write down these details in the plan.
“It’s not just financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan this as well.”
A man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle in Ilfracombe
After spending the night in the city, the man who went home was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The 40-year-old was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm in the Oxford County district of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Around 2:30 a.m., British officials described the shooting as an accidental act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
Injuries do not threaten his life, and the police ask witnesses for help.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday,” officials say. The death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the destruction of communications services, officials were unable to receive any data from the Dongala regency, a region north of Palu near the 7.5-point earthquake epicenter.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
With a population of about 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, established on the narrow west coast of Sulawesi Island at the end of the bay.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency stretching along the coast of Sulawesi Island to the northwest for more than 300 km (180 miles).
In the regency – beyond the province in a smaller administrative region – in 2017 lived about 299,200 inhabitants.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic pillars of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mainly concentrated in Moroval on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesian disaster relief agencies, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last century.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongguan killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami hit western Dongguan in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia’s ring of fire in the seismicly active Pacific Ocean is continually shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake in the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean - more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and the beginning of April 2005, several strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Niassa.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 quake shook the southern part of Indonesia's most densely populated island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 quake shook the area near the western province of Sumatra's capital, P<0xC4><0x81>d<0xC4><0x81>go.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, a magnitude 7.5 quake shook one of the Mentawayo islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami with waves reaching up to 10 meters that swept dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, due to the slight earthquake in Aceh, the Pidgia Jaya regency was devastated and panicked as people remembered how everything had been devastated after the horrific 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong earthquakes shook Indonesia’s much-visited island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
An Alaskan police report released on Saturday said 29-year-old Palin from Vasilas, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction to report domestic violence, and resistance to detention.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin was returned for custodial detention to the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and released for a $500 bail.
“He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked to apologize, he claimed to be completely innocent,” the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the suspected attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault at home, obstruction to report a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while being insensitive.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when she linked her son's brutal behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after a tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos showing the moment of the tsunami strike are shared.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rarely Applied Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953 for federal crimes.
On October 31, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly rented a truck from Home Depot and launched an attack on a bicycle lane along the western highway in Lower Manhattan – driving down the trail, dropping pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in the southern district of New York on intent to pursue the death penalty, prosecutors acquitted of the sentence will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court’s document, both of these charges can result in the death penalty.
After the attack, a few weeks later, the federal grand jury of jurors issued a 22-point indictment to Saipov, covering eight counts of murder involving rape of property (usually by federal prosecutors in organized crime and motor vehicle cases).
Prosecutors say the attack was very well-planned and premeditated, and that how Saipov executed it called it ugly, cruel, and immoral.
"The actions of Sayfull Habibullaevicius Saipov have caused injuries, injuries and loss of loved ones to members and friends of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake<0xCA><0xBC>o, Ariel Erlii, Hernano Ferruccio, Nursing Hernandez and Diego Mendanti."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The most recent case requiring the death penalty was in New York City’s South District a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009 for the murder of two drug dealers.
The last time the death penalty was executed was in the 1953 New York federal case of their spouses Julius and Ethela Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Mr Saipov, who came from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
Police said he had also requested the Islamic State flag to be hung in the hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders representing Saipov, said he was clearly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty rather than pleading guilty and imprisonment to life without the possibility of being released will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
Tory MP says Brexit negotiations should be handled by Nigel Farage
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Euroscepticism, and one of May's MPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the House of Commons, told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already resigned if Farage had been Brexit's secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unite her divided supporters have been revealed by pro-EU protesters who have joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the prime minister to implement her agreed compromise plan in Chekars, when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies have insisted that it strive to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihale that he wanted to ruin Chekers' plan.
He argued that Farage should be an equal partner and should be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left the EU,” he said.
Wellingborough said: “I am fighting for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to obey others.
We want to make our own laws.”
Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also took part in demonstrations and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Cheker plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular also among the members of our party and the activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the plan and start listening.”
In a critical message, May added: “Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they issue a decision in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust for us, the nation and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the nation’s army, which brought us the Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists mowed posters with "Tories Against Brexit".
Labour leader Lord Adonis fired the Conservatives over security concerns they had experienced with the party's app after the conference began.
“These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus plus, frictionless borders and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider taking part in presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, is taking part in November’s re-election, where he will meet with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it may face a short 2020.
Since Trump became president, Saturday afternoon’s event in Holloway has been her 36th meeting with voters using a public-to-public meeting format.
One participant asked if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and that it must be led by women.
Detained suspect in LSU Sims shooting case
Louisiana-based Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11:00 a.m., Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man they saw.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near the Southern University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist and was locked up in the custody of the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
198 cm tall, Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, of which 10 started in the fifth, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, earning 5.6 points and a rebound of 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world championship title when the team instructed him to give victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team's orders in the race would be of the utmost importance.
Starting from the first place, Bott made a great start and, defending his position in the first two corners, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to sneak into the two-door garage, leaving Hamilton and he returned to the race at the tail of the group, so it was destiny.
Mercedes turned into a two-stroke garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton erupted forward after almost contactless action when the Ferrari driver after a double maneuver, in order to maintain a position in the third corner of the track, did not want to.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the end of the race, but at the end of the first round he was already running seventh.
He was the fastest in most races because he drove without changing tyres to make it to the finish as fast as possible, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
At the end of the 44th round, he turned into a two-stroke garage, but in the remaining eight laps he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line by a fourth.
“Valttery was having a hard day because he was doing well all weekend and when he was asked to pass me on, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday summoned Senator Dianne Feinstein for insistently denying a leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not name Ford directly to the Senate Law Committee, but said what was going on in the Senate showed people to be rude, indecent and wrong.
“What could have happened and is actually happening in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, mean, indecent, and wrong,” he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? “Hey, hey, what?
I'm sure not.
I didn't leave."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn’t,” he added, posing as a senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh, which was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: "I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations and I did not dismiss her story."
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.”
But apparently, the president disagreed with her denial, saying during a meeting with people on Saturday night, “You know, it was really bad body language.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Further defending a Supreme Court judge candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats used the allegations to their advantage.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
“You see scorn, obscenity; they don’t care what they hurt or what they have to go through to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dandi's Giants
Dundee Stars backed up for Friday's loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League and won Saturday's rematch with Dandi 5:3.
The Giants jumped ahead early when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilliers scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had flattened the score before Dwyer brought the Giants forward again.
Francois Bouchard of the Dandi team tied the score, but later secured a victory for two goals from Lukas Lundvalds Nielsen.
Adam Keefe’s men suffered their third defeat this season in the Elite League, having beaten the Dandi club 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after handing Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Beauviller doubled the lead after handing David Rutherford.
In the hard-started games, Sullivan returned the hosts of the arena to the game with a goal of 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's hand over, Cownie<0xCA><0xBC>i tied the score of 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants went to the first lead break, and at the end of the first lift earned their second goal of the evening.
With a quantitative overtaking, the pitchers regrouped and Bouchard again leveled the score 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen advance the Dandi team for the first time in the game at the end of the second innings, and consolidated the victory by earning the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last innings.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
Flight attendant dies to help hundreds of plane passengers flee Earthquake
An Indonesian flight attendant was declared a hero when he died while helping a plane with several hundred passengers safely into the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are believed to have disappeared after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continued to be shaken by heavy repeated underground strikes and many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport in Palu, Turkey.
He remained in his workplace to help the 6321-flight Batik Air plane, which was already on the runway at the time, safely take off.
Then, thinking that the air traffic control tower was falling, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We took him by helicopter from Kalimantan, Balikpapan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is a very painful message for us,” he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands as the country's disaster relief agency reports that the cities of Dhaka, Sigismund and Boutongo are hard to reach.
"The number of casualties is expected to increase, as many victims are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated the city of Palu; there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supply supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances bring victims.
Lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could worsen.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and appealed to the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia: One man missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Micronesian Pacific lagoon, the airlines now say one person is missing, although they previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from a sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at Chuko Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
Air lines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing lane.
Some witnesses believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane had crashed from a very low altitude.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that in a sinking and inundated airplane, he and others managed to get down to the emergency exits.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he himself suffered an uncomplicated head injury.
The U.S. Navy said its sailors, who repaired the nearby dock, also helped rescue people who were being taken to shore by the inflated boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in aircraft crashes in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets out a sequence of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented the available facts in a re-trial case on Saturday against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told jurors how he used cell phone tapes to merge the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in his city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "lieing because his truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Telly claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Cell phone records show that they met each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Telly deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and address information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin teaching its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he believed the case would be handed over to the jurors later that day.
"The High Breed": what is a conscious hip-hop?
The Hiphop trio wants to change the negative attitude to this genre by spreading positive messages through their music.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has distanced itself from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to go back to the origins of hip-hop and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have recently resurfaced in the UK with such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple after being fired for ‘racist’ message
A New York babysitter has sued a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a message sent to the wrong address from a mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denied the allegations and called the lawsuit “rape.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was shocked to learn that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NOEEEEEEE, BUT ONE BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But she sent it twice, not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the perceived negligent act Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Maurice, claiming that the former nanny, who was an African-American, was doing her job poorly and was hoping to meet a Filipina instead.
Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice has now sued the couple for compensation for her dismissal and seeks to sue even at $350 a day for half a year of life and work at a client’s home, for which she was originally hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things can't be done," she told The Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rebuked the accusations of racism by denying it and saying that firing Maurice from the job was reasonable because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She is not racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plascas told The Post.
“Would you trust your children with someone you were unkind to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Plascas, who referred to the lawsuit as “rape,” said his wife had a baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not a very nice behavior,” added the investment banking specialist.
While the court case is under consideration, the media has rushed to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Won't Understand Speaking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel in another place reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked for a BBC operator before discovering the inspiration to write a book for children about a plush bear, would not have been overly disappointed if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was a year after his father's death and a year after the death of his father.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important family member,” she added that the father was silently proud of his success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“Because Paddington was so much like himself, he felt like he had a child who accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your job.
I think he felt the same way about Paddington's success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always devoted merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was unforgettable and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to the Nicos Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors failed to save her life.
“Nad has been calling and saying that the condition is really bad, it is not expected that she will survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad who called to say she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, “Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given by doctors that supported her heartbeat slowly ceased to work and were removed from the body.
She died a little earlier, and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn’t hide, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, not realizing what a hard test she had to face.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was lowered and there were tears all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards of grieving women aim to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women, who have lost their loved ones to suicide, try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge distribute postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want one parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidny, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates the room.”
But he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his own suicide brother.
Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur.”
Davis created postcards “to let people know that there are people around who can be contacted and talked to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mr. Humphreys, longtime friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Mark, who retired shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed and complained about anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his attitude changed.
During Christmas, the situation was absolutely bad: when the children rolled up their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye and didn’t react at all.”
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It left a void in the family.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to live on and fight.”

After the FBI started an investigation, Bretto Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for — a limited-term and scale study — maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “bureaucratic” in the strong grip of supporters.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their opposition is determined only by time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to show up poorly, their efforts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in Mr. Bushui’s White House and through him met his wife Ashley, Mr. Bush’s former personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh could get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
With Kim in power, the number of North Korean deserters has “decreased.”
South Korea’s lawmaker said North Korea’s deserts to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seugas, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that 1,127 deserts were identified last year, compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tightening border controls between North Korea and China and rising human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Many of North Korea’s deserts eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often force them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which were stranded in the center of talks on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons.
This took place after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when the two agreed to essentially aim for the Korean Peninsula to become a nuclear-free zone.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is inappropriate to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these remarks in an interview given on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I just can’t help but think that if a woman did so, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his introductory speech, speaking about family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes without a start to scream or immaculate.
He also completely condemned the committee's former Democrats, calling the accusations "grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that the evidence Kavanaugh gave proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his bias towards Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by his statements and by the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked whether he would seek to remove Mr Kavanaugh if his candidacy were confirmed and the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“If he’s lying to Congress or the FBI, he’s not eligible to take office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s working for right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Pelosi added that she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Accessible Healthcare Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the approval hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time to say hysterically, biasedly, to become a judge: ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
The Power that Women Should Use
This is a legitimate criticism, a bitterness that she cannot express without tears after months or even years.
“When we’re angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That doesn’t seem unusual to me, does it to you?”
She continued: “I was very much helped by a woman, the manager of a company, who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she invented a method: she was angry and started crying and she said to the man she was talking to at the time: ‘You may seem to be crying, because I’m sad.
I’m really angry.”
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from one of the first jobs in the office, which was mostly done by men and where I once began to cry for unspeakable anger. Then I was grabbed by an older woman behind the pendant, a harsh manager, who I always clung to a bit, and stretched to the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” he told me.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
Democratic congresswoman Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard the alien ship Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Somebody called me "The Snowman with Seven Dwarfs."
When the campaign started late, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore not to announce her candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an uneven fight.
She noted that some sponsors who donated $1,000 to men donated only $250 to her.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she thought.
In her speech announcing that she was launching a formal campaign, she was so engulfed in emotion – a system of gratitude for people, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters, not representatives, and anger over sexism – that she ruled.
“You would think I was nervous,” Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her speech.
– You would have thought that I was supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I remember thinking about what would be inscribed on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S. and China Trade Generations May Benefit Beijing
The first ointments of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say disagreements may eventually benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning earlier this year about taxing major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The strongest opposition came this week when new tariffs came into effect affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), i.e. essentially half of China's exports to the US will be taxed.
Beijing responded to all of the measures by imposing a five to ten percent tariff on US goods totaling $60 billion.
China has sworn to fight the U.S. tooth for tooth, and it looks like this world’s second-largest market is definitely not going down in the near future.
Washington would ease sanctions only if China obeyed the demands, but it would be too difficult for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly defeat the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its part properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would jeopardize both countries’ economies is actually far more dangerous than observers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia New America Security Center.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says He's Ready to Accept Returning Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Due to progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer,” he said.
The government continues to seek to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists and to restore the normal situation.
All conditions have already been made for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions aimed at everyday life and well-being.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he also stressed that the country will not accept conditional support or assistance from the countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team, which beat the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the Ryder Cup at Le Golf National in 2018 near Paris, France.
The United States has lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup in the continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish-born captain Thomas Björn scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had a tough run throughout the tournament, struck from the starting pitch straight into the water by slamming the 16th hole in the 3rd round match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari won all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament took its current form.
American Jordan Spieth 5:4 defeated the lowest-ranked European team player Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, Sergio Garcia of Spain has become the most successful European player of all time, with 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It was an easy year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
“I’m very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the relay to his homelander John Ram, who beat the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's game.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 of the biggest prizes and only landing Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the ground all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing appearance of the team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we started pressuring the Europeans.
We pessimized.
I'm wearing a hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
