What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor any bakery in Prague.
The new elected members of the CSSD at the City Hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their former and new colleagues at the ODS.
The newspaper Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the dough that was born during the last years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cream launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected did not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Prague's politics," Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elect, responded to the test of the vocabulary of the "father".
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
“It’s the only expression you offer me that I use.”
Otherwise, I don't use the argon.
From the vocabulary of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial team chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the City Hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry shop", "beef nerve", "capital betrayal" and "entoler".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to direct education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not get the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek squarely refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of civil democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I'm currently looking at how we're going to understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky apparently would not recognize in the above legend, that it is Janousek's influence on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to 'Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky said, adding immediately, “But I know from the newspapers.”
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he joked.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the sense of "going to the bakery".
"This is, I think, going into a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the headquarters of the companies of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexicon of argument in social democracy.
"I've consulted with colleagues and it turns out that we really don't have something like that."
“The names are sometimes called abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I used to be called Briza at school, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Brezina said.
The newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy to the members of the Party or the less friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
Nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to employ within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear much about Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Martial Arts Law" seems to recall that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who have been declared witches share common traits.
Rather, they are part of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this destiny."
“Young healthy women are not judged either because they are involved in labor and have children,” said a sister who works in the West African country’s capital, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a booklet that is supposed to help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” warned Die Standard newspaper about the drawback of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil that they sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals said it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings ignited at the touch of the woman.
The oil flared, it seems, when the team wanted to “hunt the evil spirit” of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human mind-eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
“The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that he appears to have participated in his death and would have been endeavored by black magic to kill the President as well.”
"Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to the rescue brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, randomly selected men and women in villages in Gambia," Amnesty International said in a statement.
At the farm, prisoners had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heated, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out of the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s who is pursuing a sentence.
The deregulation increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," the man who has the signing power pointed to his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he said in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be issued to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to it with a gesture of the hand.
"One says this, the other says something else" by frowning at the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price expect.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to illuminate on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems as everywhere - requests for repairs, events related to insurance and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special ticket office for new rentals has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," the employee answers, after a moment of hesitation, behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The derailment and old miners' apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats stated this quite strongly before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a putt of a board in the toilet, the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure they will receive a discount on the new rental price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent,” she said.
And yet RPG puts both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said in a statement.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives her right.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable with it.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she said.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 that should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Haverosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
The rental increase in 2011 is 15 percent and affects no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices comprised of the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can visit.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini kindergarten business since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially those of childbearing age, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
Along with reduced-time employment contracts, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the Arch. Design. company as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (in the amount of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years ensure qualified personnel as well as the launch.
After using the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to make the application for the endowment.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they have more than three years for most.
As this is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the program of the mini kindergarten is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children don't just play, but quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to preparation for school benches, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay to go to pick up the children in a school far from the parents' workplace.
Therefore, parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The house in bones still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi’s interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house has received from the locals the nickname of House in Bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, that is all that is ypic for Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation one can see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
Wood waves copy window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of doors, eyelets and slats.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of an entirely new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-apartment house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Park Güell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the hot house just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the House in Bone".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that barks".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of the construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time,with ventilation fans and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permission to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like the pillars of construction being embedded on the public sidewalk.
There was never any modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third one a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase that leads to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced with curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with the light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is decorated and with wells of lights.
The two-color set gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you need to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have different criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and sommier give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the selection several things are decisive:the weight, height, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and sommier will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels at the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also crucial in the choice.
One who spends the clear of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misappropriate the "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico for example have suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around at night like you did after a tough match.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also acts as a protection against squalls.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, which is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
"However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Materiel-Mathematicians and Decorators who has dedicated for several years to the problem of mobilizing and sleeping in the school.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own bunk and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the sofa at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the layer of form and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of sommer.
The bunk bed, when the mattress and the bunk bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses went very badly; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night sweats normally from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and stuffed) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists refuse to make a claim over a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything at home.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the covering of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make zippered coatings for the whole set, that is to say that after opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the large models (and for one person) becomes a problem when you remove the ring between them.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a sommier?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with aeration holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pocket springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of aeration.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position slatted mattresses with 14/18 slats, the latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled from the lower part of the back.
For multi-position mattresses do not take spring mattresses as it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special connection of the slats that allows the slat to be pressed or even tilted so that the shoulder of the sleeping person "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as their backs,” it’s really important.
This is already considered by the mattress manufacturers who for the "masculine" have begun to use a softening area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plate tops with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and decreases the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and puffy air) on good mattresses and soother, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the sommer or the area soaked in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in the organic mattress.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use precisely soybeans.
“The Bio label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” says Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress linings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While birch plant extract so that the mattress lining absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the linings "warm" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for weak sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and sommier is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses may be available for the price of one as part of special promotions by manufacturers or producers.
For example the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the lining for 11990 crowns.
The second one can be taken for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur matter at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing huge loading factors at the start.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes it an optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against poor sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases, such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a lighter box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka touched a lot of people and they started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the leading tracking devices suppliers in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing on him, he will get rid of it.
“Even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to deliberately getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child doesn’t have an electronic device that can locate him.”
“Actually, it’s the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices are going to develop, they (the criminals) are going to pick them up, too, because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
"In such cases, the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help during an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device may be configured in such a way that it is in regular transmission after a certain period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in a lying position without moving," Cech said.
According to him, so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologue.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those that are worn as a pendant of the size of a lighter box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km of them.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The military bought detonating cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords at MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it turns out that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could live on for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, no more than 2 m of detonating cords are enough, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the mentioned 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their firing weapons and that firing sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy so many detonating cords from us."
“And it’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
"For us the army is a good customer that we strive as merchants to satisfy," says STV Group Sales Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the defense ministry, argues that the military will have hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports that only four years of life of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and army are only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years," says one of two who does not want his name to be published given the criticism of the army.
The life span passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of corded detonators.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the buyers from the defense ministry.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralized the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their service life.
This was established for safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexibly more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes.
Today the defense ministry has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, towards the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today “cheaply”.
To this day, I am taking advantage of the contacts I have gained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the competition for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Libérec lacked a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 half- demolished apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another one of the same quality has happened to him.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates have manifested themselves,” the number 1 of the entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the commissioning of a large-scale hotel, the victory in the competition for the Entrepreneur of the Year has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very nice," he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relationships on a regular basis.
According to him, the fame related to the success has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I see in them above all the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized.”
"It's not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been swiftly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to collect the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but also my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight against the competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the property by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in the vicinity of his father's factory.
Not long after they began to specialize in plant oil presses.
After 18 years, it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who have started to realize that they are collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year did not pass at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company was assessed on the basis of 2008 and partly 2009 economic results.
And it was precisely in 2009 that it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to halt their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
“Obviously we have not escaped this situation.”
“Revenue fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even fire,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society needs to know that from time to time unpopular measures need to be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and retained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We have built a training and research center with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
It all suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of posters go up and with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes nonsensical regulations.
The absurdity of the year survey is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some ridiculous regulations have been removed.
The little glorious winner of this year's Inquiry into the Absurdity of the Year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register for insurance payments controls," said Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration (CSSZ).
To bring out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdity of the Year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If 3,000 voters came out last year, at least 4,000 voted this year.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the business, and,this, more and more.
"We may be among the number of documents to be filled out for tax returns in the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was established for the first time in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the most votes is declared victorious.
Until the last survey last year, there were about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by contractors but also by trade unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is the obligation that motorway and highway maintenance vehicles pay for tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees paint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always starts in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which regularly participate political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the climax of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts stones in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to declare a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee to the Labour Office, was removed with the Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year—the requirement to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that monitor their company’s environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business,” says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the rebel year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the contest of the company of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activities can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is not an example the Prague prologue company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which for 17 years has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities.
In addition to caring for employees with health problems, we can also mention The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of them and which, for this reason, obtained the title of firm Responsible for the region of central Bohemia and which ranked third in the region in the competition of the firm of the year organized by Voda.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreased to 35 hours per week on average and,this,without,proportionally, a decrease in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a local activity in the surroundings and is concerned about the environment.
“We are striving to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least environmental impact,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s chief executive.
The responsible company IT Enlogit from the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support The Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transportation, qualifications and recreation," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year contest were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company category, who had completed the enclosed questionnaire of the document for registration and had sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
Incomplete or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the competition "main" the firm of the year of Vodaphone".
“Independent registrations are not possible as this is a sub-category of the main Firm of the Year competition,” said Karel Goldman of Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public tender
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have carried out arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos. G.
It had sought precisely to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land would be obtained by a determined candidate.
This had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for an insider offence as part of a public tender and competition," Antonie Zelena, head of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Pilsen, told the newspaper Pravo, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
In order to know how it might have influenced a public competition, one can only speculate on the basis of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually arrested the police in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
“It was a client and in no case an employee,” she said.
According to Cerna, the public competition is called "Call to propose rights for transfer of land under the Land Act" and is set up when several beneficiary candidates appear.
"These people propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to returns that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the acquirers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund's spokesman said.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information regarding the persons who had registered to the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary person because having bought a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to the candidates on the ground not to participate in the contest.
And it was probably because he was withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at FdT (Funds des Terrains).
He appeared in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
It was Lubos G. who had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, concretely the place and place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a surcharge of a hundred crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January onwards not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rentals will also increase.
As of January, families will have to pull up to a hundred kronor a month more than they now have.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity for households in apartments is expected to be around 100 crowns a year more than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, especially photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the most consumption.
It is also possible to count an additional hundred crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating varies from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 more crowns per month for central heating as of January, and families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For residents of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change, the Pragoi will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
Rental prices will increase significantly in the 450,000 apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns nearly 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase it to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for relapse are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the children's departments of hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
"The trend is really strong alcohol," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a bottle of dad in the cupboard, it’s sometimes whiskey but it’s the fernet and vodka that prevail.”
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rum or Fernet."
"It's now fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home," Jurinova added.
According to the Pelikan Department Head, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he practiced pediatrics for ten years, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the vast surroundings who were completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times.
"She started her career at twelve when she was brought up with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood with an additional mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours," said the Department Director.
It is precisely the disinterest of the parents or their extraordinary tolerance to the fact that their rejections indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"The alcoholic vocabulary means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that are not found in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," Pelikan said.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home after emergency care by their parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, it excites, according to Pelikan, three seasonal waves with which one can count: Witch's Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink despite poor results or they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course, I lived on Witch's Day an admission of seven drunken children at once," Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "wooden cheek".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They're better off because they're having a great evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ mood at least with the grade to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“Occasionally, I applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer working seasonally to pay off a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, he said, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should recover care-related charges from parents, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two out of five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defense traded Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were until now in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining Lestrois units are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently parked at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
The L-159 single-seater aircraft scheduled for exchange were taken on long-stocked aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Department of Defense.
"The two-seater L-159 T1 has been exchanged in the state," he told Pravo Pejsek.
He assured that the army will not remain without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the L-159 is EADS and that it will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the business of the one who is considering how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defense did not call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defense management argued that the exchange ensures future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only used 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the annular are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before age 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, notably by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular one.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the annular the risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60 the risk reduction reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two cited fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
A less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was aware of the study but that it did not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, the deblazers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometre in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 highway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
On the 91st kilometer a truck was accidented, on the 93rd two heavyweights hit each other, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave right after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A queue of several kilometers of cars was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car queues are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff still has to meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 high-speed links because of the snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11am in the night until 5am in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but by doubling vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impracticable, on the Brno road there begins to be snowstorms in places and on the Blansko road chains are mandatory to pass some communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snowblowers and snowflakes.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is strict in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly breakable explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it explodes at the contact of the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel fragments falls on it, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press relaxation, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 Jobs Relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located in the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 more jobs so far scattered in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the building of the Marienbader Square.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville building, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "little vertical" building, as well as the rest of the buildings at Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall, which aroused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be partly parking spaces, but also because of the height of the parking spaces.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt group specializing in Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered the world’s third-largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were leased in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon Server Expulsion - Threats to Assange
WikiLeaks is experiencing more and more problems.
The Internet service provider Amazon has kicked out of its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal the political pressures suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to reports published in newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," the cyber-activists said on Wednesday (local time) behind the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Recently, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had removed WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the highest number of accesses to documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks continues its revelations: “Awesome, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers following the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s employees.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier given previous WikiLeaks publications of classified information,” the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, threatening our national security and endangering our lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the content of stolen documents.”
The founder of WikiLeaks, Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden’s prosecution of him as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats had been made against the site.
“Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly responded to statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee has demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief Government Adviser Stephen Harper told television, evidently in an ironic way, that Assange should “be killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy arose between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to look at the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely putting the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Center, has been appointed responsible for fighting leaks.
Travers is in charge of implementing "necessary structural reforms" made necessary after Wikileaks' disclosures of diplomatic cables.
The White House is also willing to check the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "University Gelato" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
The glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice cream confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated showcase using a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To know, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbet machine manufacturer founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream for several days, as well as practical sessions in the private glacier.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others risk simply realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, an artistic education professor from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the industrial ice country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years, she wants to draw something unique from this nerve-wracking profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency are decisive.
However, Luciano does not forget in the course of training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
He then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a pasteurized basic white cream comes out of it, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice creams.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
One who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, for example, from guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you need to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will bite nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to get you dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and forms, when added cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a well-balanced blend can properly enhance the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruits (winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to calculate.
Ice production no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it ointment and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automation, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo chews fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal bowl mixer escapes him.
Master Luciano believes that "a similar incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've been well informed," Testbiotech Director Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been a key contributor to the development of EFSA testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The regulations developed correspond, by paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities located in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without any condition or transitional period. In doing so, She changed camp.
Recently, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is exploited as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (Ilsi) based in the United States.
This body considers itself to be a neutral forum for experts in the fields of science, industry and politics, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feed trials and that the environmental impact of these plants has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what the impact of genetically modified corn is on the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we discover them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck says that "the industry controls safety research".
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell has procured a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube behind her back.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands of people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into a multi-billion-dollar underground station.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the halt of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it to the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken or disappeared in the dump," he said in his office in a hut, which used to be a guard post.
He says he was the subject of insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of Project S21.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Around 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently won one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 kilograms with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to do it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still piled up in the forest, the rest having been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Private.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These scandal stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of grass platforms.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"wasn't that political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, circumnavigates his vast 20-hectare empire.
He graduated from law school and later began studying biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career runner.
And a lover of stones.
It stocks 40,000 tons.
He accumulates treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's breaking up.
Sandstones sculpted with art are laid on the snow.
"Once upon a time, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a bunch of fingers: Red sandstone, previously part of Karlsruhe train station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with the help of simple palans and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put into pieces."
He did not become rich, much less rich.
In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycling company.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Struggle of talents to conquer the high potentials
The counter has a strong influx.
16 students struggle to buy salmon breads, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automobile manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they must talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the company Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in the competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities don’t publish statements about their students’ performance, we try to identify and retain outstanding talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group is softening the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares pens, candies and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know students, take a closer look at serious candidates, and appreciate those who sign up as collaborators."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we try to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In sector assets, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a kyriel of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineer positions remained unemployed in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the engineering vacancy will expand further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to tour the U.S. in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who has to participate in the selection process decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are becoming increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to address their requests to our company soon," he said.
Apart from the direct flattery performed on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a completely classic way by participating in professional fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the Solar Technology Fair,” says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are contested on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or to write his/her final project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced at solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group can't do that," says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
Money has long since ceased to play the leading role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotional opportunities are the other determinants.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual chart of honour for German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the employee framework conditions.
Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think the candidates are mostly relying on external assessments of a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own staff.
“Satisfied employees are the best messengers.”
When their employees are treated well and they identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and thus permanently canceled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains currently banned.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is at the root of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to authorize the conduct of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multi-billion-dollar claims, is at the center of the allegations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of the drilling decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security orders, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced he would remove the lucrative tax niches of oil and gas groups.
Actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: “No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it emits a smell similar to that existing in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmental activist tells reporters to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man immersed in muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy drag that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored water flash.
It cannot be noticed that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that once she collected shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled from an oil pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages jumps in the eye as you travel through mangrove swamps crossed by streams of water.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat cracks a craggy brown water, and anyone who plunges his hand in it removes any covering of oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the soil like liquorice sticks. The isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
In vain we search for the clouds of birds, as we usually find them in the wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this former paradise that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari in a sad air: "Our lives are characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a very besieged battlefield for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was executed later. the inter-group of Shell's activities were used for this purpose.
Even today, the return to the country Ogoni is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields of the country Ogoni are too unexploited for this situation.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel slabs like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are gnawed by corrosion to the point.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time into pieces because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion liters have been poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to what ran into the sea in the accident of the super-oil carrier “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the largest natural disasters in the history of the country.
Who is responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell Group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conducting failures is “much higher than usual.”
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of cambogia and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with cambogia up to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motif on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the droplets of kerosene fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
There is only one refinery in Nigeria.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they buy their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who drill the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, insignificant portion of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include senior politicians and military members, charge the lion’s share in tankers and smuggle it into the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether environmental disaster or rather subversive activities should be attributed to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries.”
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated so badly that it was no longer a question of withdrawing from the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
Then Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you degurpised," announces the rugged oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In every respect, this fucking thing has brought down our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
When examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction flaw that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had apparently been more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian authority in charge of air safety found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue creeks and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, according to a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
These include Rolls-Royce reactors and 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among these.
The Australian airline has now filed a lawsuit against the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney, which gave her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the oil inflammation that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that additional safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized its entire fleet of A380s on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
As a precautionary measure, Lufthansa has replaced the reactor of an A380.
The two-story plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany hot: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per spot.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to cope with the snow that kept accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that tidal waves will occur along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowstorms on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the bad weather alert station Meteomedia announced the level of purple alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In some places there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stranded at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
Snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, despite this only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on several roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hammered to a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barreled onto a sliding road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing good news: The snow will still be soft and dusty, but it will whirl in the event of light bursts.
But the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: The twin towers in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, according to the "Financial Times Deutschland" newspaper, citing a spokesman.
This spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said: "We are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and to put them back on lease at a later date."
Thus, Germany’s largest financial institution has already ceded its seat, shortly afterwards.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from equity holders and subsequently rehabilitated them.
Transformations towards energy optimisation have sunk, according to some indications, around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
Of course, a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the buried minors who were declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continued to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been inserted into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the minors had no chance of survival.
Until now, the bodies could not be lifted.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth, south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the commemoration that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that minors will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the trenches, said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
Miners of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have started extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles told reporters that when explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an Artificial Film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one dead eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero's waiting for them is awaiting them.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borgne does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, to the detour of one or two sentences some horrific screams of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and one celebrates in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that constitutes the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher", his fierce and stylish drug dealer trilogy, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and essay cinema.
Most fans of art cinema must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and into the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom when the borgne boards, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and fog before the crew continues to arrive in America.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who faithfully stands by the bog, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the Borg hero whose mobiles are never known, but who returns from hell at all times to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also only for those who are rotten anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at excitement, enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But the country refuses to take a stand on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, as it is about the reactor that Syria built, it appears with the help of North Korea in a stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been in use since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even inside it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have barely more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery has become more and more thickened.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about how he makes sure he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly rushed away the debris of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from a Member State showing the moment directly following the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it improbable.
Since then, damascus has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the inspectors to carry out a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and denies access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel is keeping a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this nuclear case has been going on since June 2008 without a result and is "transforming increasingly into a serious problem for the credibility of the Agency", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, in the end it is a violation of international law.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities they are dealing with, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also as the names of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access to all three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear that the inspection team is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat told Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve for fuel production.”
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nonetheless, there are plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been later separated.
It is unknown whether the gravels, which could hide traces of high value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of dirt trucks have disappeared, no one will have information about where the gravel is stored.
According to the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria undertook groundwork at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to dispel suspicions.
The IAEA has spent several months developing a plan on the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the invested time shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus has also disregarded this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not have been signaled for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who for a few months evoked what is known as the special inspections could put in place.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "It would be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
Angelina Jolie has been making her summer debut as a filmmaker.
She wrote the script herself: it’s a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
Persistent rumors indicate that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav War.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some footage scheduled in Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
In the meantime, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war addressed a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat; a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script tells a long story about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, after a few hesitations granted a filming authorization in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not come later despite this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she is not pursuing political goals with her film, that she has made a lot of effort to become aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Internet. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This still makes a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his killer".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on false information.”
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, all is well again with the Irish.
There is no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overdoes visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy against the background of loud music, they step on their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in South Ireland vibrates because players throw and successfully drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the opponent's team's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer pong". The winner will get 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to attend the world beer pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will conduct hiring interviews in New Zealand.
“I feel a strange feeling,” he said.
“My home country is so far away and I don’t have a job there.”
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed a great deal of ease, sadness now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, particularly affects well-educated young Irish people, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was too much money.
But in the meantime, three out of every ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times abounds with letters from readers written by young emigrants who complain: “In Ireland, everything is going awry.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity is leaving and our country for a generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the lights."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future ahead because the government is just throwing dust in the eyes and offering no prospects for the future to young people.
“They are cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her comrades cramping from one unpaid internship to another.
She states that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers comprehensive support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, so he can finish repaying the loan contracted to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he said, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don't live anymore."
It bursts out with an embarrassed laugh as it crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house jointly with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
“It was crazy moments, no doubt, the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, resets hot tea and declares: "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he has often heard lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
"Working for a while abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future behind and discovering how life happens elsewhere.
In his palmarès, he already has a few years of work in London. This is why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that has been worrying him in recent days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears she might turn into a farewell party.
“Just, not a lot of emotions,” he says as he drinks a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it still sounds worrying."
"Let's call it a goodbye evening, all relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific region of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shattered support for democracy.
While this has held up well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only suffered a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and dropped again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31 per cent say they or a loved one have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country devastated and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers scattered around the ballot boxes, looted polling stations and intimidation
The polling stations were open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have erupted across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti at the United Nations, considers the event to be “a pretty good election in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round will reach the second round.
With an outbreak of cholera raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards, required to vote, had not yet been issued shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's election could depend on Ms Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, to abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confusing.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend extra income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sank into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one MP hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit the salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices of Argentina’s agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the momentum of growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index; which resembles a prelude to INDEC’s clean-up.
It is unclear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which kirchnerism is highly promoted.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate, quietly, many of her husband’s policies.
A half hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, or 70 percent of eligible voters, ran for mayors and city councillors in five urban districts on November 27 as part of what is considered a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings about the continent, having tied innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My test passed, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayoral seats, it failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned toward complete independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including lorries in the countryside and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Link, purely through his face, wounding and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says PDP leader Tsai Ing-wen, the murder had consequences for the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates enjoyed the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from exacerbating anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Government of Beijing can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the cradle.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has been reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he was going badly: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything in its power to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that they too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presents a “trustworthy alternative” to Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were poor; despite staggering economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office and local antennas would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the "Best New Artist" category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a major nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the artist's public identity."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding in relation to the fulgurant success of Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent of the last years of Gramy's closest production.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historyity" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on a revival of a recording that was one of last year's prime favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of New Orleans' raucous voice and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved accolades in the category of big ensemble; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his band's main octet's live hand was a belcrast example.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
The top nominations include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also running for a prize.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project; and the "Synergy Vocals" met the sy sys.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Orchestra" by the Orchestra and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Sh'Orchry
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he was soon writing the 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received an appointment in the category of orchestral performances, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solist nominees; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixes category, soprano Jessye Norman received an nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics started the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahá'ís, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said in a statement Thursday morning.
“I’m proud of that as an American citizen.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very loud voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until nearly midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, the speaking time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmush denounced the violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families coexisted without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque would consist of two minarets and rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant of arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very special, even though it’s far from being a truly ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We wonder what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to trigger biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Scientific Research, Planetary, Kingdom Key, Open University, United States.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a coincidental discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow gums the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she says; so, researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to shape life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibit dogs on four thefts from outside a Bellflower motel have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We're following orders."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter located in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas — Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female — were healthy and safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the Long Beach AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, where they planned to introduce Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly a month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have a little open the windows, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van was stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear if a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially rented out the creditors' "pre-packed" plan that would wipe out about $5 billion of the debt; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there is no longer any legal hurdle before MGM to reboot under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which is running itself at $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial hardships and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be reworked as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreement and internal debate, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, who raised $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a “successful premium” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plans to relaunch the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and build an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio is to conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Budget Gifts in Balance
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed perhaps by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a major break in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that one Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are plush toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pushing, you can’t stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with quiz game cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with self-correction and a valve notebook.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don’t educate as efficiently as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), this is the first major review of the Leapster range, with a newer, brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 year olds) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and e-books and comes with an SD card input that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a lighter box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Penguin Club pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button stacked micro-robot.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone doughs in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin climbed a square of the city like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, lowering orders with military authority.
He wanted Chengguan’s female members – imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and propensity for violence – to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be drilled!"
Show them, he says, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, were watching you.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair attached by a knot striped in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said, with contempt.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city has demanded that all new recruits have a postgraduate degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged gray-green uniforms for a more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the low-eyed with the strong way: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by casting black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a major image operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, elbow and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulty drawing attention to this underground urban brigade from China
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province killed an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon carrier was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
“Chengguan has marked the government,” China Daily, a national publication, said last year, after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had any real jobs or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, ages 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a size greater than average, i.e. 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that matters,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the candidates' outward qualities will determine whether they are appropriate; it is about size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan’s women are like flower vases, he said, adding: “In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Disabled or disfigured persons are not required to apply.
"We can't let a boxing person or a boss come serve here," Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pommeled cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn’t consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?” she asked in a dismayed look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague in the pits, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing salespeople into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen strolling merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many bread rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers’ property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after spreading false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and officers of the Chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from Placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police officers, with their sinister faces, smashed a road to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Justice Department have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign in a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get a job lobbying for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case hits the national headlines last year and hurts his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Department of Justice had "informed Senator Ensign that he was no longer under investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice abstained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case with her husband.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called ban on lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the law of the swing gate," said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level backlashes filed by his department's public integrity senator, including last year's follow-up decisions.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the director-general of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he had received a phone call Monday from a prosecutor at the Justice Department and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, “had acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, alleging that the $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Department of the Interior on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as a fourth-rank Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to contest a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice's lead and end his investigation.
Senator Ensign is delighted to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
About half a dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of the horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and the children tied to their bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeals, likely to occupy the courts for years.
What’s provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial — as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists — has created a “circus atmosphere,” a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public’s passions.
The request could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I experienced it in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is undermining the human rights of a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, attorney for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, laconically dismissed the claims in the ruling last week, claiming that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
The Courts of Appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was a “carnival atmosphere at trial” because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts seized to review half a century later Mr. Hayes' conviction may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the media of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue claims that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for more fair trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered damage when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes when selecting the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical in front of prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure on a verdict by taking the unusual decision to bring a judge to trial.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to ignite the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily buzz of media, camera and journalist tweets in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “wasn’t anything like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the news snapshots were more incendiary than the releases delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would impoverish the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the trial's media coverage and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a forerunner of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the swift return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders has produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “lazy duck” session.
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the Committee on the President’s Deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interplay of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of mutual testing and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then they disappear.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "duck duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is envisaged on extending unemployment benefits, even though Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism floats over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lazy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will come back to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the electorate present at the tea which contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to be up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early responses to the recommendations of the Committee on the Deficit, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to them, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had a hard time reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group; this suggests that there are few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fights between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes, and health care; followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who is judged to be a loser will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Revealed U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy” and passes through to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out massive rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They are raising money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then there has been little sign of cleansing.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these allegations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV channel when questioned on a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's thrown, it's anything."
The Russians believe, in an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow City government and the crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and to claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government, according to the embassy note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscovo.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is bribing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
A source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by it."
“That’s why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is no longer as high.”
The note notes that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly referred to the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the cost of corruption would rise, across Russia, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the US embassy, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that the train is in trouble.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to what U.S. diplomats had revealed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Former Khmer Rouge fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with degraded, low-quality concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School referred to the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longstanding loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to publicly face the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed by the United Nations, delivered its first sentence against a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced to 35 years in prison the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this situation, anxiety has increased among the former Khmer Rouge fighters of Anlong Veng; complicates reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia’s Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
“The situation creates divisions within families.”
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla guerrillas from their base located in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for dropping their weapons, these are low-ranking, unskilled farmers.
"These people have benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we have to support our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to prosecute senior leaders and key perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether it was prosecuting beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a hectic evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overrun with weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of rusty sheet metal.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated at that place.
“But he has a great spirit, and many people go there to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stockpile
The Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component of nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to a grievor who cited the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and weakly enriched uranium,” said Lukashenko.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago, however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with weakly enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Meticulous coordination and organization have been put in place to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Study, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus aims to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has issued no objections to the CIA thefts
The government has issued no objection to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the government at the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising a vigilante on the plane".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, a meeting took place between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the out-of-game Zapatero government" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken away," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The head of the Foreign Ministry at the time, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators.
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations,” she said.
The parricide that passed to the confessional complained in the network of the "accablement" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; both originated from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they broke up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She cohabited with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, we hear that their idyll has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then, she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take him away when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up for a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if all went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July there is another post.
When she stabbed him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Majorca.
“He’ll be there at a few hours in the summer and that’s how I save some money from the babysitter.”
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30, another: "The child is fine, he goes in the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who has lived with her, watches, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He does not want to think that everything had happened so that she had not told him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday the Provincial Penitentiary of Palma, coming from the centre of judicial detainees of Menorca.
Attorney-at-law Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
Before, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these committees normally doubles the one that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections they received 316.222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while the PSC will now have less than 9 deputies, while the PU will also gain more than 10 deputies.
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy — he now has three — while ICV would keep a deputy or win one.
But if the electoral agenda persists, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal assemblies, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the 2011 budget for the highest - 661 million.
Both the nationalists and the populists agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the City Hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, of which the mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
People have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there have been three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the 2008 General Police Information Station of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among which "Tigers for the Liberation of the Land are the Tamil" (LTTE) and "Tai Lt.
The Ministry of the Interior gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" "was weakened" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged and then distributed to groups that included the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combatants” could cross the European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations involved, apart from Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days hits similar to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (we held the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Sadique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand we held the Butan Sihar At and Muharman At.
They were the ones who ran the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, a transfer agency from Catalonia sent a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized ample documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are simply to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of directing the country's philo-
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independentist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have a common bet to slim down the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiations on Mas's inauguration will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician claims that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people of whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to carry out the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat for La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatrician patients - which he suspected in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any person other than the accused".
The person already named "the Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the center staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of interns, used to kill them.
But lab tests will clarify if Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
La Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the manner of killing with success.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
the ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat that warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The differentials of the peripherals have closed to force and the shares of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend current liquidity measures “at least until March” and maintain the unlimited-access quarterly auction at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that there will even be a signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
The figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published in Ireland.
The estimated figures are 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to apply for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple compared to March, at very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "aside from being, appearing".
Courage, we can get out of it!
Eulen’s president will challenge Vega Sicilia’s advice requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers him "zero of law", the judicial council of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company for companies does not appear to be willing to cede in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the January 18 shareholders' meeting this year whose objection is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The Judicial Council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate No. 2 of Madrid, reopened the thunderbox within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse by the applicants to his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct them according to the official assembly."
This argument will be the basis on which, once the assembly takes place, it will be contested considering that it is "zero in full".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, requests the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the challenge request for which there is not yet a stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the champion's skill as a driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from manufacturers around the world, power stations, and high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in his Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time,” the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team currently employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s cars except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can go from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that every Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this duty includes 580 people, including two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero, without a doubt, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R&D progress in racing cars accounted for 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of the success, while the drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because “they are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to Install 20 Clean Stores with Local Distributors in Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of a network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the renovated store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openers were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, support, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves possible problems with HP’s computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
“This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical support services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on ‘stealing’ one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the Passive War.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in the interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years one million particular customers, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new Master Plan in 2011 with a three-year viability period.
The goal, apart from surviving without resorting to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can leave the bank - its great task to be accomplished, because so far this bank had ruined more the company than the SMEs and the private customers.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the wager on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with the reduction of costs as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, because the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year's Optima master plan, established four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Customers letting go of savings banks will be their main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental year.”
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking case, he insisted.
And even if he thinks the war of liabilities – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash registers pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the drop in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We haven't tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "there will be demands for larger dimensions."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He argues that capital needs “are increasing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but unlike what happened in June, one can obtain short-term funding through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the banks
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out in the time frames that have been set in the past, not now, in the plans of ban-
"The move from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serenity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind us that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed a "lack of knowledge" to people who question it.
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has recovered well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of help to unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, from the management of the airports of Lo de la Barajas and El Prat 30%.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not an error in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which collides with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems from science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigor, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, therefore now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany thought we should do (fiscal rigor and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then it has been subjected to fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been approved and in the coming months we should be witnessing the process of reforming the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in arrears and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany signals to us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be a pity not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked for is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquillity.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that was given to us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel’s criticism, the way has been paved for the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And one of the possibilities envisaged cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too overcrowded with unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has cast a lot of ink on the anti-sportive character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the game ended (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho and different economic sums to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather a common one in the world of football.
It is so prevalent that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that this was provoked by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays the nobility and honor and on past occasions has condemned to a fine to its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization of his orchestrated, seemingly un-spoiled, histories.
In any case, the debate asks whether this kind of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulations, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e., whether these actions constitute a fraud of the law, since they are actions that respect the regulations of sport but seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the correct gameplay is to prevent the team of offenders from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has precisely tried to avoid the possibility of avoiding it.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of benefit that offenders receive from the deliberate wrongdoings examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move to the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part of the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they rather chose the moment at which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without breaking the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the line between genius and fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the lottery and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive you adjusted prices to be able to catch the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros association dinners or interviews.
To finish complicate the accounting, this year’s calendar (as New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the circumstance, they are all demanding battle prizes, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The deal will go well “for those who give quality at a good price and with good service,” he adds, recalling that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so the slice around 25 euros became majority in demand.
In a survey of various center facilities, the collapse of requests for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
“We did the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they say.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 venues, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in turnover since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, hope for festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concern in U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked through the WikiLeaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "also" and that the unstable Asian country "produces no more than a world of nuclear weapons".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of short-noise nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said U.S. expert Yuri Korolev during a meeting with the U.S. Department of Defense.
The novelty of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan’s high degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy letter in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," said: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
In Search of the WikiLeaks Leader
Obama will nominate a senior anti-terrorist officer to prevent new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
Nonetheless, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
This is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20th.
And this has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks’ founding lawyer, Mark Stephens, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20th International Police Corps based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization of the authorities of that country.
The 188 Interpol countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue a warrant for the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice appeal a freeway for the arrest -- which the national police force must carry out --, especially if they find that the bilateral agreement is of mutual agreement, and is of particular interest to the authorities.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks was willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which compares to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and in Australia his mother is defending his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an indefinite interview to Time magazine’s director via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation as "ridden and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us at all," he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying Assange would have to be "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the government that leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eyewitnesses to Carod supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the yet another internal revolt inside ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he has had with others.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand from the president a little more than to make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council's vote on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a certain fact.
The ERC leader confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization able to wash its laundry in the family once and for all.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various goals" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he highlights two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from Carod's adept sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion mandated management to revise the assembly model in a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.

A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots as he left his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head shot each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, in the municipality of Ecatepec.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes banded.

In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Department of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza, two warning messages of death were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.

On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image were detected.
Around the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads rubbed and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message beside; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at COP16 assured that its country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and rebuild its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nonetheless, he made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and pilot program support.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets addressed in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-annual plans in progress or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps to economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than previously thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The NAP national leader detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is legal.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the Commission of National Order to claim what is legal.
In the interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he enlightened that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's revival in the July 4 election will be reflected in the next dispute, even though "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"At the moment, it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so we have made "a lot of hopes in terms of them, and I am sure Gabino will be up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years in government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He stated that the Federal Executive's holder can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no whistleblower, let alone censorship.
Obama Promotes Law for Students Without Papers on Twitter
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today with the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the passing of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope to have soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block voting on any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax issue is resolved we will be able to set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem needs to be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek a "debate-closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely is next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, stayed in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But the supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the help of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the pro-project organizations are lobbying intensely to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures de la langue was a walk in which the participants exhibited the narrative.
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and which this time used the sub-title of the question (referred to in the other part of the question).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderated table by Marisol Shultz and in which participated Valenzuela, Ramrio Montero and Sergio Garezuela.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined later as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a fascinating narrative that he titled "Eloge à l'invention", where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous witch who touched the clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to speak then America, the great news that had conillos from the beginning of his own chroniclers and quotes from Caste.
Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty.
Nonetheless, he stressed, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, one no longer knows what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the "Tradition of Cervantes".
“It’s because of your heritage that you are what you tell.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The Debt on the Wound.
The Cuban-Portorican has its say on the great plague of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - producing disputes about drug trafficking and sale.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "last chemical reaction."
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it owes on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting our finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established and nuanced ideas and also disturbing the powers that prefer white," he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find each other a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up comforting himself with the under-champion medal, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played in consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also arrived in the decisive duel and was lost against Ray globally with 3-1 again.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a setback, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two chances to get the title and finally succumbed to 4 of his goals.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with his rival Monterrey in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil one to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any stats, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to finish it".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not bother him sometimes, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular deadline, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the bad ones are the fate of us
Romano now has the opportunity to stop being an under-champion technician and taste the glory offered by the titles for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must go to Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to submit to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will present certain benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the visa processing and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not be required to present themselves for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken into the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery Thursday, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When citing the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Opposite 'block' Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be enslaved by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
"Until now, that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow Congress, after having been monopolistic, to be now “duopolistic”.
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more, the Convergence has abounded.
PT's Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that Congress has now turned into a 'butin' between the two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the MP, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave through cupular agreements outside 5 that will probably be 9 MEPs, now in the five that we see, separated into different factions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are out, we are out."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 thousand pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With it, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "account liquidation suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Supreme Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, consequently, how many more cheques will be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We haven't bought anything, we're just paying him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet published in the Official State Gazette, according to the Act, when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a revision of the checks that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval of March 2008 - July 2010, in the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality to pay Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42s.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a hole in the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the Mazatlán tourist sector asked authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities should replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune we lose, otherwise they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“They’ve only been given the attention they need and this kind of facts highlight something that is notorious for everyone, the interview is necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be aligned with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up-to-date, clean, tidy and attractive as it has a tourist vocation.
“Happy Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination.”
IP asks for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs should take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector of Mazatlán is calling for a decent and agreement-free Labour Legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs should take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
“We hope that MEPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to protect their own interests and they transform themselves into a carnival masquerade of governors and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to building the necessary bridges that are making progress for the current Governor.
“We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of the Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in pursuit of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job creation."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is inconsistent as a major economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it rivals directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures were unable to resolve.
We're looking for a magical king
Puppets, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old little brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothing sizes for a year.
“He told me [José Alfredo], ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I said to him, ‘We’ll see, my son,’ because he was very dear,” Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isaiah, 10, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estonia on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly at sites that were allegedly used to produce drugs.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that were used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec's Security.
Eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were expected to appear at the Sherbrooke Courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were the result of a long-running investigation, which lasted nearly a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Estrie de la Sécurité du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Régie took part in this police operation.
Illegal immigration can continue without problems
The Conservatives bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be defeated as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would detain for up to a year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is taking it to the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has turned down criticism that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that measures should be taken against smugglers, and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are telling MPs massively that they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a straw.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the wake of its rejection.
A Conservative, however, told QMI that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each MP who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity does not make unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec reportedly consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue as early as last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Standing Council on Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for Peking public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron to describe the announcement as "a rabbit coming out of a hat" and "a DIY solution at the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it," he said.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus forcing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to the matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit biker groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted the Gangster Act.
Highly monitored rivers
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another sliding occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has slipped.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, i.e. 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is a fear of overflow of several streams.
Flood warning warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North in Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentides, and of the Oak in Lotbinière were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten homes had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Centre de prévision des crues du Québec has issued warnings of strong crues for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (CBNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as its gross wavelength.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that is not suitable for broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Producers must present solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'After noon' have addressed a sensitive subject fairly and appropriately."
Therefore, no blame has been placed on him.
The last dispute involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a face-to-face media that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI facilitator said he had not made any donations to help Haitians because one could not know for sure that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My record has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will have to, among other things, announce these decisions once during the hours of high listening within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, explained.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security agent and as a commissioner for UPS has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've progressed in every competition."
"At this pace, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous fighter from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely answer his presence at the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the most prestigious and the most prestigious in China," said the friendly Gaillard.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who beat me was a real pro,” he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their category."
"The winners of each category face each other to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor got the most important, that of project management, for an amount of $295 million without bidding.
This consortium called Énergie gérance was established in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec chose to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium secured the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
"It's the new way to collude and knock down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly," Peking MP Sylvain Simard said in a news conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lack of rigor."
She said "this would be the least of the things" the PQ apologizes for.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is expected to be completed in 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortiums in the engineering consulting sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick override of the Quebec Business Register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
As for the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to particular labor dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded to them in a particular way since the 1970s".
The major Eastmain project manager, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract was granted voluntarily.
“If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price.'"
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's people's competence," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 engineering consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Énergie gestion.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before specifying that they were rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in fair labels and eco-certifications to guide his choices.
Pis, even though he swims in a media world where messages in favour of more responsible consumption thrive, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they don't believe in companies' environmental commitment as much as companies' green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, according to the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumer information, however, seems to be crucial in stimulating this segment of consumption that is currently being driven by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of information would calm the cravings of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they are trying to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habits and especially changed brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, the Barometer says.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year -, the Homo consumus du Québec likes to portray itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A State Loan for the Acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only on a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who were hoping for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him back his full cinematic vocation, do not get what they were demanding.
The government agrees to be involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be lower than initial expectations, which could provide a viable solution on favorable terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm’s counter-proposal arrived at the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the state must really be discarded.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinémaparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment from the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the sky, for ten years carried out the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after he himself financed its construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crispy in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to keep its customers loyal.
The Angus Corporation and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are conducting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by screening Xavier Beauvois’s beautiful film Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Duty and it is unknown what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks are lifting the veil on what the U.S. sees as the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they are also betraying the U.S.’s sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government get its budget adopted in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out on the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, describes how far the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives some explanations for this situation.
“An almost inherently Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than having this election run over the United States (as it did during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about.”
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa businessman, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, where Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-$40 billion recovery plan," Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed revival plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that dramatic series broadcast on CBC return from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O shows, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the abductions for muscle interrogations by the CIA.
Another cable reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
It echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations today proposed in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the UN hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, better yet, by fluorescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be emitted by humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to raise global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But another 5 Gt will have to be subtracted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade by 2020 in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all-new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have made reservations about fluorescent bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast awaits the announcement of election results with nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire to be published "without delay" after the deadlines expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the interim results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission let the deadline for Wednesday night pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the CIS president told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Appeals have increased around the world on Wednesday for the CIS to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign director, said the UN's voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are withheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the former rebels, deemed the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that bringing a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), according to the corrected data of the temporary seasonal variations (CVS) published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate was up 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, increased to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over a year), or 482,000 people aged 50 years and over, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini arrested and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the general council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and imprisoned at the Luynes detention centre, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, treason, active corruption, smuggling of influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible bosses, it's another thing to prove them," her lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, through his lawyers, had to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined Wednesday night and knocked down.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of them, said Ms Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was examined on Wednesday for divestiture of public funds and complicity, and released under judicial control with a prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are being blamed on him."
“The instructor magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty,” said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been examined and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "trafficking influence and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined, one for "subtracting and hijacking of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in hijacking public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "refusal of abuse of social goods".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently caught in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies served to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out as part of a series of judicial investigations opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous correspondence, for alleged fraud in public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
Close to the source of the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", held the opinion in France, put diplomacy on the alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to deal with their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been compensated for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a crude light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with cases of hostages".
The Elysée’s advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "murder constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
Because, after the attempts of discussions through discrete channels, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' release from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she took refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros in bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage attacks, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris on a decision by a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine networks for acquisition of nuclear-related material, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been vivid exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot revert to the judicial decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs it, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not spared its efforts, through statements and “leaves” organized in the media, to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role of “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles are repercutting on the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media blitz of French officials".
On what is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited".
In exaggerating the Syrian role, Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to “seed seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
No online games for young Koreans spent midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, officials from the ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make free software available to people who demand it, which will limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints organising countries
In the midst of suspicion of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday designated the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking the lead on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The one of 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its settlement in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC released a layer of it on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to disappoint FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-issue the successful blow by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained for London in 2005 the organization of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to redouble the coat of arms of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial outlook of both countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the shortcomings in its file (stadia, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced “unfair competition in the preparation of the vote,” in a barely veiled allusion to the English press’ accusations against EC members.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favorites.
As the world’s first economic powerhouse, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very nice project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the event in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World Cup 2026 to China, which is strongly desired by FIFA, which would in fact reduce Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar coming out of the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not fit well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
Speaking to UMP MPs on Tuesday night at the Elysee, the prospect of "two terms" has sown a bit of fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken of the presidential election, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of the day before do not make him more a candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they raise comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it’s not Ségolène Royal’s entry into the competition that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is on the contrary because his 2012 candidacy is obvious that many in the PS are demanding a battle order earlier than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on that," the prime minister's entourage immediately and cautiously responded.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of sovereign bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the terms of exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that are due to be completed by the end of the year.
Crisis of European sovereign debt obliges, the issuing institution of Frankfurt certainly will not be able to afford to be so peremptory under the penalty of aggravating a situation more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...) ".
On the eve of his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more dissent about his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for the purchase of sovereign bonds in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see" this meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main stewardship rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest ever since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have bought in for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Neither do economists expect a noticeable change of course.
While loan operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB is still making unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she is changing her schedule in a significant way."
"Otherwise, it would risk causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds in order to animate an atonement market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packing of returns paid by the most fragile states,” a major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday, with the rebound of bond rates at 10 years.
A return to the precarious calm.
After leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person then denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to some crowding in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the attenuation of tax revenues that comes with it, putting the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italy's International Monetary Fund administrator to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2 per cent of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up an unfavorable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans Reflect on Strengthening Anti-Crisis Devices
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “Europeans, I believe we have demonstrated it again on Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although relative, yesterday’s slowdown on rates of European government bonds brought water to governments and the ECB’s mill.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
Standard & Poor’s has announced it could degrade Portugal’s debt rating, the target most targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which affects banking systems in particular," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas said.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures of support to euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issue of EFSF securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are in the process of adopting structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
Both are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that are essential to sustainably restore confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of sovereign bond market standardization.
On November 24 in Paris, Axel Weber first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigil
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and is likely to disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigil due to the risk of snow and frost.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigil, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snowfall affects the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are noticeable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmentals have been banned with heavy weights of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking his vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the circulation of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to be as cautious as possible on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly."
The Civil Aviation Directorate-General (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on Thursday at Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly due to upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been on the rise, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is evoked for the Grand Paris metro that is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Now we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, which was reviewed by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, section 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is encoded: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to assign this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," reads the statement of reasons.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
“From the moment you create revenues (both taxes), you can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the $4 billion afterwards.”
"This will be included in the budget and drawn as time goes on."
The SGP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised $4 billion is still available to absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers Hackers and Spies in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what could be read in any newspaper for months (except those Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi’s sinisterly cartoon profile has long been for sketch-based cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor knows where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who reconfirm what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, as I know, editor at Libération), who retain as true only what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as Newsweek was publishing the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make such a lot of noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into a center.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims in crisis as much as the “crazy”.
But let’s get to the deeper nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, any power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had fully proved itself since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s power to reveal all secrets meant empty.
WikiLeaks has done nothing wrong to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - this would be to publish it on a sticker on the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction falls within science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, being carriers only of messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding such information in the rakes.
The information will be kept in single copies in locked drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in the crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph (telephones).
Video cassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow them to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that the policy and communication techniques are back to horse cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on inside the embassies.
Now it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: How France keeps its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the compliance with the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (so-called fast start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the great French bivouacs are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, major side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has committed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of ODA.
Concretely, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed equals 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> given.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given a loan... At most, the equivalent of interest should be counted only for the cost of commitment.
But France has to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the EU to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other countries) meet their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1 euro to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice turn of pass!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, she manages to make it appear that she is spending 420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy did the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting system for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister for the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of about ten years old, in Paris and in the supermarkets.
These types of meals, including official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – as well as treats, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The score is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, is expected to be an encas by the study, and has traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most “rich” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt from it.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
