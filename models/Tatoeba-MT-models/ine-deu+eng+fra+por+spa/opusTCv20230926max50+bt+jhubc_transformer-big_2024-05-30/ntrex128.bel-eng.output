Some of the other people are worried about what they look like as a puppet.
Some MPs do not understand why their deputy status should be changed to the status of "Member of the Parliament of Wales".
MEPs were outraged by plans to change the name of the local assembly to the "Wales Parliament".
Members of all political parties believe that this is a scam.
One Labour MP said that his colleagues are concerned that it rhymes with the words "stupid" and "unspeakable".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "unspeakable".
She said that her group was completely dissatisfied and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the convention, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a "puppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a bill to amend the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the members of the Assembly are called will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the East Wales the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the national consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for calling the meeting the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of additional MEP, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or the CNC, but the option of the CHUP received the most support during the public consultations.
Additional MEPs are obviously proposing alternative options, but the path to consensus could be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a bill on changes over the course of a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional MEPs will hold a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a long-standing issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim on their territory, which has prevented Macedonia's inclusion and friendship in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Georg Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a cost to pay for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The names of the St. Martin's Church are silent, the churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
“Once upon a time, as the old people with whom I spoke said, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People have different relationships and relationships nowadays,” he said.
"The bars are no longer cozy local lounges, where people walk all the time."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for such a long period as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by dwellings with condominiums filled with people who will not help the temples that remain in the area.
“The vast majority of the residents who buy candaminiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore it will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will move to these places will come.”
Both churches were built by a community of whites before Harlem became a black area – the Church of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The original White Methodist Commune departed in the 1930s.
The black community, which prayed nearby, was given the right to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by a black community led by the prominent John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders at the main Harlem trade fair on 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building heavily damaged, but believers under Father Johnson's leadership planned a renovation: they commissioned the carillon.
The iconic David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the karylls "the callings of the poor."
The expert, who played the krill in July, called it a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first krill to be played by black musician Diannisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to the larger krill in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Meryweser said that he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin over the past few months has been a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted to false leaders of the church, others to the diocese.
The congregation of the faithful – the governing body of the parish, which consists of the assistants of the chaplain, – wrote to the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese “trys to transfer expenses” to the congregation of the faithful, although the congregation did not participate in the recruitment of the priests, the architects and the architects.
Some have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy during a dive to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming, asking for help, and then navigating with others to help you.
At first, Hamel thought it was just an excitement from lobster hunting, but then he "understood that something bad had happened: 'I was bitten!
They bite me!”
"His whole key was torn," said Hammel, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: “In the water near the shark!”
The boy was airlifted to Reid's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Lara Giles told a news briefing that the shark had been spotted at the spot a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victims had suffered injuries in the upper part of the trunk.
Activists closed access to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablade to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening departments with beauty products in the department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of a significant promotion to the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashionable clothing and household goods is declining, the larger beauty homes will be represented in 11 countries.
Investments in the field of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the place on the shelves that were previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the volume of beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in corporate departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Large stores are also relaunching their Boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming more in demand among young buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London, and the second will open in Sally Oak (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of products every day in local stores around the home leads to the fact that supermarkets have to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coope, executive director of Sainsbury's, said the shopping malls will be more and more like department stores as the network of supermarkets tries to compete with Aldi's, Lidl's, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats points since acquiring both networks two years ago, which, he said, has contributed to the growth of food sales and made more profits.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to rebuild their beauty departments and pharmacy did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split revenues from pharmacy stores ended after a series of dismantlings in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 stores Celesio to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's pharmacy network for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was stated that Lloyds played its part in this regard by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive setting and convenient location make us a better home of beauty that counteracts the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby refused to accept a deal of <0xC2><0xA3>11million.
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones got angry after TV host Holly Willowby declined a deal of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Mark and Isner.
There's no time for a brand of home goods and accessories Truly.
The couple's business has become similar to the brand of Gwyneth Peltrow Goop.
This morning, a 37-year-old leader announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with his profitable business by creating branded clothing to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was upset when the "golden" TV girl admitted during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakinghemshir), that her new deals in the amount of up to 1.5 million rubles.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Peltrew Goop brand and was doubled to double Willowby's wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly, it was Holly's main priority.
It's the long-term future that she'll see in a couple of decades.
The decision to reject the decision left all the participants completely overwhelmed.
No one wanted to believe what was going on on Tuesday, so it was very soon to start lunch.
The Marlow Headquarters has a warehouse, full of goods, ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading This Morning, which is among the most significant British stars, can cost companies millions due to huge investments in various goods – from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, as well as from the
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin had been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willowbee founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
The couple are resting together, and Jones owns a 40-percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willowbee will represent the M&S brand and replace McPartlin as the leading ITV celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We're not going to comment on his case."
We're in love, we're in love."
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for his comments, which he considers "non-presidential" for what he says positively about the North Korean leader.
Why is there so much that President Trump refuses to do?
Trump has spoken out in his “dictatorial” voice.
“I don’t give up on anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not expect "appropriate measures" to be taken by the United States in response to the outbreak.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We are building a very successful relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“Everything could have ended the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
“We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of remnants of the U.S. military to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
“Being on the side of the president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we will already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lambock, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lambok have been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they did not seek international aid, so it was a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is gathering a team to travel to the Pole, it is not clear whether foreign employees can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for Combating Natural Disasters, said that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia has always been experiencing, the country is still well-prepared for the natural hazards.
Despite the fact that they were built in Acheha shelters, in other coastal villages there are hardly any.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of tsunamis in the Pole led to more casualties, although there was a warning.
Even at the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
Natural disasters have made it more difficult to move.
The hospital ship, which was placed on Lambock Street to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching Pole, but the road to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure and has spent money on motorways and railroads.
But the lack of funding haunts the Joe administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of prolonged interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority embrace a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs whitewashed the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starydge from Liverpool kicks the ball away against Chelsea
Daniel Olde saved Liverpool from Chelsea's loss in the Premier League, leveling the number at the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
The old man got a pass from Jordan Shakira when they were about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goal fold, which was 1-0.
He made a fine ball to the left of himself before making a shot at a distant pole.
The attempt ended by scoring high under the upper rod when the ball flew into the upper right corner of the grid.
As a result, the ball flew over Arisabala's head, which jumped straight into the grid.
“He was just trying to get in this position to push the ball, and players like Shack have always been trying to push as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible,” Starr said in an interview with Liverpool.com.
"I saw Kante running, made an easy pass, didn't think too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the start of the second half after Belgian star Eden Azar lost in the 25th minute.
Attacking the "blue" in this match made the pass of Mateo Kovacich, before returning to the midfield and running in half of the field "Liverpool".
The cockroach quickly reached the center of the field.
He then took a shot, handing over the ball to Azara at the goal.
Azar ran around the defender and pierced in the lower left corner at the far rod past Liverpool goalkeeper Elisan Becker.
Liverpool compete against the Attacks in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Agency for the Elimination of the Consequences of Natural Disasters said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, Sutopa Purvo Nugroha agency spokesman said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake with a power of 7.5 points, which was up to 7 meters on Friday and out.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed.
The investigation into the murder began after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Mercyside) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with stab wounds in the Grayson Museum district on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard of the incident.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything that was suspicious, suspicious, or unintended.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers, the video recorders of whom may have taken some video, to contact us, as they may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman who was found dead lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today, a woman's friends came to the scene of the incident to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Museum, has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
A policeman explained to one man that the entire area is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene of the incident.
She said, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the apartment building.
Anyone who has information should contact the police department at <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling record 247 of September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell was the last century-old blow to the “rewriting of history”.
His removal would have been poetic justice for his similarity to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artefacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Cry’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell memorial near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornickroff's brilliant presentation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the figure's historiography, which many believe should still be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "A lot of people have known Cromwell better since the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of prolonged historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually cognitive figure who represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be commemorated and honored.”
The killer swine was killed by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in the market in the southwestern part of China.
“A man known only by his nickname, Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and spilled blood, next to a lump in the Lupaneshui market in Guizhou province,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
Pig farming was preparing to introduce the swine vaccine in a pig farm in Sinina, China, on May 30, 2005.
He and his cousin reportedly arrived Wednesday from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pig house was open.
He said that there was a big cock in the porch with blood on the dog.
According to the report, a forensic medical examination confirmed that 550-kilograms of mucus depleted the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were uncovered and damaged,” said Wu’s cousin (according to a quote from Guiyang Evening News).
Video footage from the surveillance camera showed that the yuan entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases where pigs attack humans are rare, they have been the case before.
So, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, as a result of which the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had squeezed a Welsh farmer into his tractor and held it until his wife had released the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Arizona was fed his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a dropping hook.
“They’re just ugly.
They're very smart and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose will bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days "Rose" will bring floods in the north of Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The speed of Hurricane Rosa, category 1, was 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 mph southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form an area of low pressure, moving to the east, to the west coast of the United States. If on Monday "Rose" approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm
On Monday, "Rose" will bring to some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of rainfall.
Then, the tropical moisture, which interacts with the incoming low-pressure area, in the coming days will cause strong blizzards in the southwest.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of rainfall causes dangerous sudden floods, sedimentary floods and possible flooding in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause the number of precipitation in places to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona. . . .
In some areas of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of precipitation is expected.
Due to the decomposed areas of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding is possible if conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to walk into the desert due to the possibility of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into stormy rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by steaming winds and dust.
The coming low-pressure area will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the coastline of Southern California, according to the report.
Possible total precipitation more than halfway can lead to a small stream of garbage and make the roads slippery.
This will be the first rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread across the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature changes in the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to a sharp change in the temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of sharp temperature changes in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri), and Amahai (Nebraska), St. Louis and De Moin (Iowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the long-lasting summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
Many central and eastern U.S. states are expected to start a warm October with temperatures of 80 degrees – from the South Plains to part of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high likelihood of higher temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched eyewitness accounts on Thursday in the Supreme Court in the case between Brother Kavanaugh and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continues, the broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of the extraordinary news on Friday: a deal developed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it's made up of the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that drunk Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his earnest testimony, said that he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were probably looking at it.
The company estimated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen company, there are usually problems with the evaluation of people who watch TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing a play-off or an Oscar.
“Fox News, whose experts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, managed all networks on an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.”
Interest remained high even after the hearings.
Flake was the main character of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters were yelling at his address and when he was trying to rise to the top.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was loyal, and it was broadcast live on the CNN channel.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, “You have authority, but many women have been deprived of it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed, he still had something to say at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live for several hours, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on the issue of the selection of Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he will only do so if he understands that the FBI will consider the charges against the candidate next week, which Democrats in the minority are calling for.
Flake was persuaded in part by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Cohen and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics that she plans to leave the European Union, that they are “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, arrived at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the front page of the newspaper was her former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "shameful" Brexit plan, stating that the proposal was not to have Britain, the UK and the EC had each other.
Wade Sims murder: Police have arrested the suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting in Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
“20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder,” the Baton Rouge police department said in a statement.
Activists showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
“Police took the glasses from the scene and said they had detected Simpson’s DNA,” WAFB, a CBS affiliate, said in a statement.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to a fatal shooting in Wade.
“The cost of the facility is set at $350,000,” Advocate reports.
A preliminary report published on Friday by the East Batan Ruzh's office said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department of the Louisiana State Police Operations Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, and the Southern University Police are asking residents of the area for help in an investigation that would facilitate the arrest.
Louisiana University Sports Director Joe Aliev thanked the district’s law enforcement authorities for their “precautionaryness and drive for justice.”
Sam was only 20 years old.
Attacking a 6-foot tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
On average last season, he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 picks per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana University basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what I’m always worried about,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention on Saturday invited Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was revealed and within 24 hours, 183 cases of gas and pedophilia were recorded.
There was a loud noise in the center and there were rustles.
Images on social media showed that in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Sawmill, there are thin layers of ash coated on a car's windshield.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Clashes with the Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence supporters clashed with the police for the protection of public order, and thousands more joined the demonstration in honor of the first anniversary of the polarization vote.
A group of separatists in masks, held back by the police for the protection of public order, threw their eggs and bloomed with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the fighting erupted when the police used their oaks to deter demonstrators.
Over the course of several hours, a group of independence fighters who chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" clashed with the present trade unionists who shouted: "Live Spain".
According to local media reports, fourteen people underwent treatment for minor injuries sustained in the course of the protests.
Tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was noted by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred independence, although the turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry protesters.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police force.
The protests continued, but the protesters were forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is attending a separatist rally with his wife, said he no longer hopes for the prospect of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“We had one of the best moments of the year.
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we’re tired,” he said.
Despite the vital but insignificant victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties, with all their strengths, have tried to keep the momentum this year, with many of their own in the struggle for independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, who records the protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict had been dealt with by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting harder,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in the SISA since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Exclusion as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Men Arrested After Crashing Their House on a Car
Three men, ages 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car repeatedly slammed into a Londoner home.
The incident took place in the area of Belindagard-Creusent on Thursday at around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, a bullet was dropped in the car.
As a result of the strike, Manga Liveston wins the Rangers 1–0.
Manga's first goal in favor of "Livingstan" assured them a victory
Livingston's success hailed the Rangers, and this was enough to appoint Steven Gerard after he suffered several injuries in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The strike of Destiny Mangi was great, as Gary Holt climbed to one level with the Hibernians in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win at the Premier League this season and will meet the leaders of the Harts team next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers in the Europa League receives the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
"Livingstan", meanwhile, has continued its unbeaten series in the division to six games, and head coach Holt is still feeling paralyzed after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances due to rough visitors
Holt's team had to warn long before they killed, but the same direction caused the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to score in the goal, after which Alan Litgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet the blow of Craig Halkett.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guest at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
On the part of the Rangers, a penalty kick was allowed, and Livingston made a debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to defeat Meng, who made the pass and scored from the center of the field.
By this point, the "Rangers"s dominated, but it turned out that the defense of the team was inappropriate, and goalkeeper Liam Callie was practically not involved.
The same continued in the second half, although Alfredo Marelos really saved Cali.
Scott Pittman's ball was scored by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and the Lithgows moved away from the second set of Livington.
The balls were constantly hit at the Liverpool goal and were rebounded, while the two penalty demands, after Halkett was summoned to replace Glenn Middleton, and the demand for a hand penalty, were rejected.
“The Phenomenon” from “Livingstan” – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alesdair Lamant at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic performance and results for "Livingstan".
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since their return to the top tier, but it is worth giving back to Holt for the way he has stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grandiose in building a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worla on the field everywhere.
The Rangers weren’t inspired.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they didn't meet these standards.
In the last game they did not own the ball, only once scoring in the goal, which was something of an alarming call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the list.
Combined Attitude to Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and feelings of unfounded flying when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They fought over problems with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish residents outside of the country's borders.
The police resorted to security considerations to prevent the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but a lot of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Protests for and against reflect disagreements over a guest, one of whom was declared a hero by the German Turks, while the others were convicted as an autocrat.

The man was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, the medics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another rapist was killed as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The police said that their employees are working on identifying the person and informing his or her closest relative about the incident.
There are road fences and bus stops in the vicinity, and it was recommended that drivers avoid the area.
"Long-Lartin" Prison: Six employees injured during riots
“Six prison officers were wounded as a result of disorders in the prison of a strict regime for men”, – reports the Penitentiary.
The riots erupted in the Long Lartin prison in Woostershire at around 09:30 British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
In order to combat the disorders involving the eight prisoners in one wing, a special group "Tarnada" was attracted.
At the scene of the incident, the workers underwent treatment for minor injuries.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were directed to fight those who committed disorder in the Long Lartin prison.
Six of the staff members were treated after the injuries were reported.
We will not suffer violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin Royal Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the attack of the detainee.
And in October last year, police officers on the protection of public order were summoned to prison to deal with serious disorders, during which the employees were attacked with balls for water polo.
Hurricane "Rose" threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which may be beneficial for drought regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but this is exactly what can happen at the beginning of next week, because there are still traces of Hurricane "Rose" in the south-western part of the desert, which create a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service on Monday and Tuesday published data on sudden floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Yucatan, including in the towns of Feyx and Feyx.
It is expected that on Tuesday "Rose" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of the Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles off the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts precipitation from 2 to 4 inches, while in individual locations the level can reach 6 inches in the Magellan area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual result values reaching 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of a sudden flood, Hurricane Rose could be long-awaited because their regions are suffering from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be useful, as droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing extreme second-class drought,” weather.com said.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to the descents on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, the Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore will dry up.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm strikes, rivers will emerge from the shores in the daytime or in the evening on Mondays.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico can be severe, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of precipitation is expected from Lower California to northwestern Sanlra, where possible precipitation is up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching the borders of Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical drop in pressure that will then continue the movement across Arizona and the southern part of the state.
"The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remnants, it is very heavy rain in Lower California and in the north-western Sanora and south-western desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and floods and landslides in the mountain area.
Midsomer Norton attack: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old body with multiple knife wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Exceller area of Midsomer Northon about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a "steady" condition.
“The 17-year-old boy and the two others, 18 and 20, were arrested at night in the Redstock, Avon and Samerset districts,” police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have had any evidence on a mobile phone of what had happened to advance their searches further.
“Cavanaugh suffers from the indifference and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the repeal of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and disgusting tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “suffering from indulgence and anger” of the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh made a statement before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the accusations of Cristina Blaise Ford that he had sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also made statements during the hearings on her allegations.
On Saturday, the President said that "on this day, the Americans saw a shining, high-quality and courageous character" of Kavanaugh.
“The voice in support of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most advanced experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president skeptically referred to Kavanaugh's selection, discussing the importance of Republicans appearing in the interim elections.
“We have five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not going to be late, I’m going to be late,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for big candidates everywhere."
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to “resist and obstruct.”
“It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the selection of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday,” a senior assistant to the parliament’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
“At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Paw on Friday when waves of six meters (18 feet) high swept across the shore, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquakes, a magnitude of 7.5 tsunami occurred.
“When yesterday there was a threat of a tsunami, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they became victims,” said the press secretary of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency Sutopo Purvo Nug at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami drew cars, brownies, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed the trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in the country.
Aerial photographs, published by the disaster agency, showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges turned and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The next storm continued to sweep the city's coastline on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times the power of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in the Second World.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "wide" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
"Victims and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of the Pole, an area called the Dongla, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
The connection in Dongal "was completely damaged," Nugroh said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Pola, but officials say the waves came at the time of the warning.
In amateur photos posted on social media, you can hear the man on the top floor of the building desperately shouting out to people on the street warning of the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall fell to the shore, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage, which disrupted communications around the Pole, so it was difficult for the authorities to agree to rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to steer cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but still evacuated very much needed food and other essentials.
The city's airport has been opened only for assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joe Widow planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pola.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision staff from Danggala successfully reached the city of Palu, where workers hid in bridge shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of devastation along the way,” Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he reported.
It's very bad.
Even though aid groups have launched dark actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers who possess deep knowledge are prevented from traveling to Pola.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to take place if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Olivia Arriani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we can open up to international aid, but that status is not yet there.
On the second night in Pal, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing without news hoped that their near-miracles would be among those who would leave the unhappy storylines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days and next to her was the body of her child.
Gendo Subandona, the head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, were his disciples.
“As an elder in the field of paraplanarism, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon said that a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the paragliders' community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to a Palu participant who was on a beach party.
His messages, however, were marked with one gray tick, not two blue ticks.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Filling ATMs in Newport on Levi
“On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brynk employee who deposited banknotes at an ATM in Newport, Libya,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car dropped the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money,” Dent. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was busy, another man "escaped from Brynk's worker" and stole fur with money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their personalities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West, who is nicknamed Ye, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The changes take place ahead of his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new Yandhi album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that was cancelled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it’s “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
I'm you, I'm you, I'm you, I'm you
It went from “Kaney,” which means “one,” to simply “Ye” – a reflection of our good, our bad, our lost, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs was differently known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced that he was referring to the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West associate, Jay-Z, also dealt without a liaison and the main characters.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use the army against peaceful residents
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Abrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the day of bloody repressions.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Abrador vowed “never to use the troops to subdue the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying, thus opening up more free seats at state-run universities.
“Unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. has doubled its funding for machine intelligence.
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field,” said an investor and specialist in machine intelligence from Microsoft, Kai-Fu Lee, in a statement.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about ME, even if there is no official ME strategy in the U.S.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
“Finding the research budget in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S. and we expect the next breakthrough in the MI area,” Lee said.
“A doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next big achievement of MI will come in the US,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Hawton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive officer of the company’s SinoVation+ Ventures, which has invested in
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellane, he worked on a system of machine intelligence that defeated the highest-profile American player Atelier, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google from China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Competition for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked if there would be a next step to help identify the next windows.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get state grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired lanterns from universities in recent years to work on ME.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the area of machine intelligence (MI).
“In my opinion, green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of MI,” he said.
The State Council of China in July 2017 issued a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
“China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, similarly because the National Science Foundation and other state organizations are allocating money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is high.”
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Machine Intelligence Center, in which industry and science partners should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machines.
And this month, the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in the field of defense announced an investment of $2 billion under the name AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which has sought to establish a National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not monitored the actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on changing their name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will allow to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed accession to NATO and the EC.
In June, the two governments concluded a deal in light of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Georgiy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the turnout of voters would meet the minimum of 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question of voting in a referendum proposes: "You are for membership in NATO and the EC with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a cost worth paying for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgieva.
Although this is not a mandatory legal force, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires more than two-thirds of the vote.
The State Election Commission stated that there were no reports of violations by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarytsa and his son Dushka voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the name of the country, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kovardarkov prepared a small scene and laid out chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads raised, not through the service door," Kavadarkova said.
“We are a poor country, but we are honored.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that friendship in NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the predominant number will be in favor, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result would be “the confirmation of our future.”
The poll, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, says that 30 to 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required figure.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's television channel, showed 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-five percent said they voted yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguar from Manchester City passes to the gate through the entire defense of "Britan"
On Saturday, Sergey Aguar and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending against Brighton by defeating Manchester City 2–0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aquarius did it with ease.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the center of the field.
He struggled between the three defenders of Brighton before hitting the open field.
At that point, Aurora was among the four green shirts.
He's gotten to a point and he's gotten to a point on the British side of the field.
Then he pushed the pass on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking first touch in the penalty gave the ball to Aguare, who used his right kick to bypass the goalkeeper "British" Matthew Ryan by hitting the right part of the net.
“The water has some problems with the feet,” Pep Guardiola, the head of the city, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the same time.”
But it was Searling who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguara received this ball in the depths of the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sean made a few touchdowns before Sterling was able to reach the far rod.
Attacking "Sky Blues" pointed the ball into the grid before it jumped over the border.

Shercere wants to play the role of "choosing points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from play-off competitions, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But the constantly competitive Shercere hopes to take a punch on Sunday against "Colorado Rocky", but only if there are still the consequences of the play-offs for Rocky, which remain in the leaders after one game with "Los Angeles Dodgers".
The years have won at least a single spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still hoping to get their first division title.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and other team will be so that the game is likely to be at the highest level in the world.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give the Sheriff a ball in such a situation.
Sherzer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a session of the CPC on Thursday and will be on a regular holiday on Sunday.

Trump's speech in West Virginia.
The president skeptically referred to the situation surrounding his election of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using any necessary means, you see, – iniquity, mischief.
They don’t care who they blame, who they have to break up to get power and control, it’s what they want, it’s power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
According to him, the Democrats intend to "resist and obstruct".
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, vile, repulsive, and liar.”
He appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the earlier recognition of Senator Diana Feinstein's Democratic group, which received a loud rating from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
"Did you leave the document?
Uh, what.
No, I'm not expecting -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer the foundation of the Church.
It's the impatience of those who express their opinions.
If the momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it's hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of MPs from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome – everything to express my opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received a similar response because she is strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate, there are similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting, which was previewed on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, said that "we want these meetings to be both local and productive."
For the majority of my eight years as a local MP from the Labour Party, that's the kind of meeting I had on Friday.
Unfortunately, today in most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of "better, softer" politics has long been forgotten, if it really ever was.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that in the Labour Party different views are not allowed, and each opinion is assessed from that point of view as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared the same political views, began to expect that I would take a step backwards, and took positions with which I would not be able to do anything at all.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there are a bunch of images on social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the centre’s policies, saying that I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are, as a rule, political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist bullying, but never shy away from it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of "uncertainty" or change in the party's selection rules becomes narrower.
"Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice asking me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then everything will be okay with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, dealing with the burglary of the government of Thatcher, because of which my education in the school has failed militarily, I have been striving to stand up for the best public services – whether for the better or for the worse.
I've never hid my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if a country is heading for Brexit, which is damaging to the housewife, the enterprise and our state service, I do not understand the desire of the party to waste time and energy.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it is my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of elections being cancelled.

Air-Mellowes 38 - 17: The Invincible Air at the Top
Two late attempts, perhaps, several have declared the final result, but, without a doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Tennessee Premier League.
Now they're running the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances that made them masters, coach Peter Mercy Merch had a full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far and we’re still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Cristi of Melrose said, "Give it back to Air, he dared more than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Fraser Clima, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for Warriors, allowed Melrose to gamble with numbers, and Jason Buggott.
Climate stretched Air's lead with a penalty, before, right in the break, he killed, and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Air in the break.
But Melrows started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bogotham, reduced the delay to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Roarid Note, which was stretched, and after the restart, Air moved on through the attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by Climas.
Air, performing the duties of Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another person to pay with the help of Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt at the end of February.
However, the hosts returned, and when Stryan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking out Climax without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson landed behind Eyre.
Climave realized his attempt, which he did again almost after the restart, after Kyle Rowe was beaten by David Armstrong in a penalty shootout and sent flanger Gregory Henry for the fifth attempt of the field masters.
The Star Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of the game Ford Kieran is going to enter the hospitality industry after it turns out that it was appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the show's series, and it looks like Kernan plans to move on after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kernan hopes to participate in the "flowing trade in Glasgow".
"Our Sea": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marquis patrols the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civilian buildings under the blue flags.
In naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "The sea is our right".
Resurrection is our duty.
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached a peak in the last decade, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by an international court on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it is expecting a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzada.
Many Bolivians will be watching the decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of tense negotiations, will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to deliver the talks.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces a conflicting fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that will change little, even if it does.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to make a decision on the territory of Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered shows that the case “was not difficult,” said Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing the affairs of Bolivia, the last four years may have thrown it back.
“The issue of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, the martial rhetoric of Marales has lost the remaining Chilean kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that, it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velte, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadalia also denied that Marales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – had used the maritime problem as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come until it can be trusted by the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ry Yong Ho, said his country would never stop using its nuclear weapons until it was able to trust Washington.
He spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit between the leaders in Singapore.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restoring a nuclear deadlocked diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Ry says it’s an “unfailing dream” that the prolonged US sanctions and protests against a declaration ending the war in Korea would ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show, we saw the newest line in massive headwear on the way to the stores in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium a variety of unusual headwear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations from the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram gained popularity with impractical hats, the designers of which sent their creations to the podium.
Valentino's distinctive feature was a luxurious beige hat, decorated with wide poles, similar to feathers, which filled the heads of the models.
Other extraordinarily large accessories included gemstone-finished blackberry, wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but they weren't meant to keep your head warm.
Brown also showed a selection of wiselish masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-coloured masks were with sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of them resembled a scuba gear with a tube and protective glasses, and the other is similar to a molten cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to adhere strongly to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can penetrate into our day-to-day lives.
Huge hats go on their heels to La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that can be seen in everyone, from Ryan to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was released in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, washed
A dark-orange raft bag, decorated with a raft trim and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer as the designer has made a huge impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for negotiators".
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have maintained achievements in academic success, this continues since 2018 with yet another excellent exam result, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other disciplines.
More than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a better level of work for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world. -
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a clear reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages rank first in the league tables with the highest enrollment rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
The data collected in 74 participating schools of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in learning Chinese, while 72 percent were those who learn German, 63 percent were those who learn French, 69 percent were those who learn German, and 63 percent were those who learn French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a vital skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject are now chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that among the reasons that employers had for the difficulties in filling the vacancies, 17% were related to language deficiencies.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the more promising workplaces that require language proficiency, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of who chooses the profession, if you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a greater chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught in it.
A number of schools will focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching staff that are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to achieve success, no matter what happens in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and preference to Scotland's youth.
This has to be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The start of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at the pre-season opening Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes it will take is still to be determined.
“It will be more one and less 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel wrote that James is likely to play in a limited amount of minutes.
According to a practice that took place this week, James was asked about his plans for "six game pre-season schedules".
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a host of campaign shares.
This is the first of Trump's five planned speeches next week, including stops at friendly locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
In confirming the vote on the arrival of the election to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the election in the face of the opposition.
When will Trump's speech start tonight in West Virginia and how can we look at it on the Internet?
Trump's performance in Willing (West Virginia), scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia online below on the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider hearings this week for candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who has problems with allegations of sexual harassment with the Senate's expected confirmation of a vote over the course of a week during the investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans who are standing before the elections in November.
Thus, the campaign of President Trump announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at “energizing the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority, Reuters said.
“Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today’s action can attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” The West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia senator Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the polls.
“It’s not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Raiders Cup 2018: U.S. team moves to fight to save hope for life on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four Saturdays may have been exactly what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The pendulum of momentum that swings is a completely invented sports concept, in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say the momentum now?
“They had the advantage with six points, and now they have four points, so I think we’re going through it with a little impulse,” said Jordan Sleepe, walking through the day.
The advantage of Europe, of course, is four points ahead, and in the game there are twelve more.
The Americans, as Spitz says, feel like they've got a light breeze, and they have something to hope for, last but not least, because of the shape of Spitz and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and everyone can boast of three points.
Spit was deadly from t-shirts to greens and is an example.
These harpy shouts of celebration became louder as his round lengthened, and he succumbed to a decisive blow to play in a game on four pitches when he and Thomas came down two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win in the 15th match, was met by a similar scream, such as one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
“You just have to dig deeper and worry about your own match,” Spitty said.
All of these players have already gone.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, the only players who have scored more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesca Malinara and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
The Mollywoods were the only pair that did not make the gods on Saturday, at noon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, on Friday, and at noon on Friday.
It happens, and as their energy seems to flow to this tumultuous crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are the players who win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close the potential victory of the National in Europe.
Both are desired at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European fame is prematurely.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergey Garcia, the hero of the morning buffet, when he was in pairs with Alex Norren.
Boggi and the two twins on the front nine drew a Spaniard and a Swede to him, with whom they were never able to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your loophole.
After the matches of four balls and four so interesting to watch carefully because of the interaction between the composition of the pairs, the parades they give, the parades they do not perform, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has so far become the best team and has taken on a significant role in the last day, but this fourth session also shows that the U.S. team is striving to fight, which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the Saturday matches of four balls and four with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired by the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Malinary, the team decided to fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the results at Le Golf National to four points.
European side Thomas Börn, trying to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. dissatisfaction agency in the morning, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a game of four balls, winning two games, but they couldn't do more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Fury's side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molliwood, who got the name Molliwood after a sensational breakout, are just the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in history.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they made a great effort to defeat defeated Woods and U.S. newcomer Bryson Decumbe in another 5 and 4.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, showed a random flash of shine, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in matches of four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested on the x matches of four balls, returned to partner Henryk Stansen in the matches of four balls before defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – occupies both the second place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time top winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set up a two-point checkpoint for the Americans.
They earned a 2 and 1 win over John Ram and John Pulter from Spain in four-ball matches and later returned to defeat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team has returned from a four-point deficit that goes alone, although the owners of Furyk only need to draw to save the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks like they'll get it all done.
North Korea says that "no way" will not disarm in one-sided order without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations continued sanctions that strengthened its mistrust of the United States, and in such conditions the country could not renounce nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yun Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year, North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill", for example, the cessation of nuclear and missile test sites, the dismantling of the nuclear test zone and the dismantling of the nuclear test zone.
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way to first of all unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Despite the fact that Ri has republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, in the framework of which North Korea was rewarded, because it has taken steps, said
Ri referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first in history summit of the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the path to the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula".
North Korea has officially sought to end the Korean War from 1950 to 53 years ago, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions against North Korea, the report said.
“The United States of America first insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unfailing dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in for the last five months and added: "If the participants of this issue of denuclearization were not the South Koreans, but the South Koreans were not.
However, the tone of Ri's speech sharply differed from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly argued that targeting the U.S. continent with the help of North Korea's missiles was unavoidable after Mr. Trump's name.
This year in the UN Trump, which last year threatened to "total destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take measures on disarmament, but said that there will be much more to do, and the sanctions must remain in place.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are arguing in the UN. The Security Council said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "Implementation of Security Council sanctions should be actively and necessarily continued until we are fully, definitively and definitively assured."
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006, trying to halt the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the Security Council. The General Assembly then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, stating that the progress achieved with North Korea over the course of several hours of talks ended with a visa declaration that he was making demands "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to eliminate the missile facility and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said that according to Kim, the "appropriate measures" he is waiting for are a guarantee of security and an aspiration to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a course on the right rest.
The Harvard University's new course this year aims to teach students to sleep more, and aims to fight the culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly care for themselves and their health.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did they just tell me this now, in my last year of school?”
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, taught by students, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting achievement, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care service, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were often out of school.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the Internet where students click on cups of coffee, curtains and books that tell about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports indicators, as well as the importance of habits.
At the next stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive pictures, invites participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we think they need to know this just as much as everyone knows about the health consequences of smoking,” said Professor Chassler.
According to him, the culture of nightclubs still exists, adding that modern technology and the steadily increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be an increasing problem.
“Ensuring sufficient sleep of good quality should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid excess weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain sick.”
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop the course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request to all insurgents to complete a similar curriculum before enrolling in the university.
Professor Chassler recommended that students have the opportunity to set a clock to know when to go to bed and when to wake up, realizing the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of monitors and LED lights.
Liverpool 1:0 Rangers: Menga scores a goal for Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another parachute when Dolly Mangy's goal ensured that Steven Gerard would not get a 1:0 parachute at the Liverpool Stadium.
Aybrax wants to record his first victory on the way to the Hebron triumph with 4-1 in St. John's in February, but the team of Gary Holton already carries the second parade of Gerard as manager with 18 games to leave the ladder on his side of eight points.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the goal-inspired Rangers team didn't look like they were suffering from parasites.
At the same time, as the Rangers descended to sixth place, the Liverpool rose to third place, behind the Hibernians with a difference in the balls.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems after the forward Colum Spence has to heal from a head injury after he has been hit by an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, which is why Ira did not play in the semi-finals of the Batfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levy under number 11, which allowed him to take a point from the Hearts last week, and was thrilled at how well they were bypassing their opponents at every step.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Livgstan made more attempts to score the ball.
They should have scored in two minutes, when Mengi first directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took this opportunity.
Jacobs Keegan's successful penalty shot hit Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow was able to strike a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game more hoped to score than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marellas certainly should have been fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lowles met on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept Colombia's complaints.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal only in the first half of the game, but the former goalkeeper of the Ibrox Liam Kelly almost gave the goal to Lassan Kulibali and an effective attack on Ovi Ehiria.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute of Leeds may have been against the next active game, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to the fans a good game.
Again, the Rangers were not able to break through Jacobs' gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson a pass, blocking Meng's chance to score in the goal.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent at the break of Kulibali, and this had an effective effect when attacking broke into Marelos, but impressive Kelly ran away and blocked the strike.
But "Livingstan" continued to please the visitors, playing the game that they liked, and Litgov and Halket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side was able to outperform only in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to defeat Jacobs before Litva went to the reserve bench.
The replacement of Ranger Glenn Middleton happened once again after being fined when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson managed to escape.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger's counter.
Page from our almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and AFTER... the day of the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the emergence of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Caravan", which featured those seemingly understated scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on the earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
"When you put on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give off radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is this really nerdy now?"!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system to “see” cancer cells.
A new antiviral vaccine can help the immune system “see” bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is supposed to teach the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory.
The cells can then "see" proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and then re-introduce the auxiliary cells.
A trial vaccine demonstrates successful outcomes for patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells, saw that ovarian cancer disappears within 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 proteins, common to many cancer cells, and then being reintroduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer,” Berazofsky said.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "training" them to achieve cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the title of IAEA, after his appearance in the SNL.
What didn't turn out to be good.
In the studio during Saturday evening, Kanye West was disgraced after a speech he praised the US. President Donald Trump said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After the evening performance of his third song, titled City Ghost, when he was in the hat, Let’s Make America Great Again, he spoke out against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America long ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with the lead role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Cowan's statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the trial of Cristina Blaise Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words were shot and uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rok.
I'm not sure if Rock was trying to get away from the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a difficult time behind the scenes.
They were looking out for me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat.
They were wondering about me.
“And then they say that I’m in the right place,” he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Do you want to see a giblet place? "Saying that he" would put on my Skperman hat, which meant he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to LOVE.
Due to his statements, the hearings were cancelled at least twice, and representatives of the SNS were puzzled by the message from Veraita. "The whole studio was silent".
West was taken as a replacement for singer Arianna Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA party, Candes Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But the leading talk show, Karen Hunter, wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always great.
“But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his ‘art’ which I believe encompasses and unfolds an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, declaring that he was now "officially named Kanye West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name and went on to follow in the footsteps of Jedi, also known as Puff Jedi.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was called the Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend who changed his name to the character, and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder in the restaurant "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a second man was attacked in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Bollywood, according to police.
The defendants are expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Keith Harrington's "Game of Thrones" star captured the idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his swinging sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Games of Thrones" in the HBO medieval comic book series
But the 31-year-old actor has received the stereotype of the hero Macho, which means that young boys often feel tougher to respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said he believes “something has happened” and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
The cat, who recently married his neighbor in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, who is also 31, has admitted that he feels power in solving this problem.
"I feel personally strong guys - if we were wrong with the courage?" - he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view of the attitude we see now?”
The cat believes that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is the beginning, and why do they teach this?
Why do they teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think that’s one of the biggest questions of our time – how do we change that?
It's obvious that something is going on with young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series will end, and he will leave the series' battlefield and will not make any docs or sequels to Game of Thrones.
From November, Keith will begin recounting True Western Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor said that he considers a meeting with his wife Rose the best opportunity to complete "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this show, so I got my future family, and my life here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who is in love with Kite hero John Snow in this fantasy series, award-winning "Emi".
The couple were acquitted in June 2018 at Leslie's headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases of HIV/AIDS
According to China, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to data from health care workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is prevalent in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
“However, the number of such people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has been reduced to almost zero,” Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people still exists.
Due to conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread from inadequate knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the left-wing, unsafe and conspiracy theory by her parliamentary aides
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters dismissed the accusation on Saturday that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that there are claims to the participants of the upper-right wing and their sites.
“A lie, a lie, and a lot of disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Commission hearings on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The incident took place a few days after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and shared information with a Waters team member,” Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely untrue,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is utterly false and utterly untrue.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Arie Fleescher.
“This rejection causes anger,” Fleescher wrote.
This shows that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of doing something they didn't do, they shouldn't be caught.
They shouldn't behave inappropriately.
They don't have to question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and cozy.
Fleisher compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being overly disheartened during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarra, a Republican party candidate who runs for office and participates in midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's a resonance, if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will bear legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again strikes a blow to the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British twist, and this twist seems to be in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny English, which began as early as in 2003 with Johnny English.
Is it possible for a satirist to express well about how obviously stupid we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creations he made for non-English viewers.
It is known that he is a secret agent who, despite his clever claims to glamour, turned out to be a bit like Clouseau with the traits of Mr. Bean and a bit of a taco guy who brought the only note in the 2012 Chorus of Fire to the ceremony.
Originally, his character was based on the traveler and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are a few fun moments that haven't happened before.
I loved Johnny English, approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor slightly pounding on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but the humor is felt weak, and therefore surprisingly especially when serious films such as "Agent 007: Mission Impossible" are certainly offered comedy as a frequent feature.
Humor feels as if it's not just for adults, but for children, and even the senseless misfortunes of Johnny English aren't as inventive as the silent films of Atkinson in Bean's face.
For many years, the United Kingdom has been facing a number of serious problems in the past.
A cyber-hacker has penetrated the super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the scene, to the dismay of a janitor – this is, unfortunately, a minor role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is an honorable and mixed actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Terezay-May, but there is nothing like it in the script.
Her intelligence advisers say that since every real spy will be revealed, she will have to engage one of those who are already retired.
And this means that for Johnny English himself, everything is complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several chic institutions and gives lessons on how to be an uncovered operator: some good examples are here, because the English offer.
The Englishman returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Nowadays, my marriage is tied to a submarine commander whose role Vicky Pepperdine has performed somewhat in vain.
Thus, Batman and Robin get horribly wrong things in the Queen's secret agency, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurylenka.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire who claims he can solve problems with the hackers of the UK: with the infamous Jason Voltam, played by Jake.
English and Bow begin their action with immediate things: disguise themselves as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board a luxury yacht Voltaire; the English make a pure anarchy, because he's disgusted.
All the moments are drawn to the last event, but equally pleasant and noisy, in which there is quite a lot of children in the TV.
Pretty good material.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I couldn't think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British a four-day working week with a salary of as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan if the British only work four days a week, but are paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants the heads of enterprises to pass on to the workers the results of the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was clear that the employees would enjoy a three-day leave, but they would still get the same salary.
The source notes that the idea is in line with the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The trade union congress has approved a transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times magazine: "The planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but a four-day working week is an idea that matches the views of the party and the general industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's efforts are not supported at all.
The representative of the Labour Party said: Four-day working week is not the goal of party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John MacDonald used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to return power from the "ruthless directors" and "managers" to utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also provide that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire package of shares, because the Labour government can make a "count" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to contribute workers to the company's boards and create joint ownership funds to pass on 10 percent of the private company's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told for "60 Minutes" that the FBI, working with Cavanaugh, must change its mind
The FBI investigation into the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been postponed for a final vote on his selection to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises as to whether the findings of the bureaus of the Republican senates will be possible.
In an interview on Sunday's 60 Minutes, Scott Paley asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about "Sense": can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to a change?
Kanedi was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said, going to court: I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and asked about the reason for the accusation, asking, "Have you done this?"
He was a steadfast and steadfast man.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Brett Kavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Bret is denying it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls, couldn’t believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Citizens' Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival: an annual musical event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Festival of Citizenship will take place on the large shed of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Kardi B and Sean Mendes – the show of the band, as well as dove
The International Festival of Citizenship, which was launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against Poverty, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay VIP-ticket) visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "manage the action", be a volunteer, write to the e-mail of the leader of the country, call any
But how successful has the Citizens' Festival been over the course of 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of convincing people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called “cliticism” – people feel like they’re doing a good job online?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival say they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their fans, who are trying to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to fulfill commitments at the expense of more than $37 billion, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on the commitments and declared at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the provision of food, partnerships with investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, "helping children to develop in full", and the commitment to provide food to the children of the United Kingdom, which is to ensure that the children of the United Kingdom do not have to live in poverty.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eliminate the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5000 shares were held, which were called in the UK to improve food for mums and children, the government announced the financing of the "food aid" project, which reaches 5 million people.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can end poverty?”
The global festival responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will suffer parasites and failures.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Kardy B, and Janel Monae are among a number of people performing at this year's New York City event, which will be led by Deborah Lee Fernandes and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy for the "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
“Washington may, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent the exit of Russian energy to the EU and Middle East markets,” U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink said in a statement.
Zinc argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to ensure the openness of the seabed and, if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy is not likely to reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed members of an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as a “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less balancing and replacing fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “one-sided country” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much cheaper option.
For this purpose, employees of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “wrong” project of the gas pipeline “North Stream 2”, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “prisoner”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is taking root in the economy and is an example of unequal competition.
“I believe that we have a single view on the fact that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said the Minister of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak after a meeting with the Minister of Energy of the United States.
The U.S. was hit by a response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industry-representing organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and the German Foreign Minister.
Elizabeth Warren is going to be very serious about discussing her participation in the 2020 presidential election, according to a Massachusetts state senator.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech in Halioka City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her participation in the event.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and order our ineffective government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider very seriously the possibility of running for president."
During a speech in the town hall, Warren rushed to President Donald Trump, saying that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, before a vote, the FBI needs to conduct an investigation.”
However, the results of the poll, published on Thursday, showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Safalca/Bostan Globe’s Center for Political Research, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support the decision.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Daval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats who have been discussed in connection with the potential 2020 ballot include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont state senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially make the decision by January.
At a congress in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic Trace Palin syndrome.
Twenty-six-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called to the service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence in connection with the incident.
"What my son is going through after returning, I can compare with the results of post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers are returning with in other families," she said after meeting at the convention in support of Donald Trump's Trump staff.
Pauline called this arrest a "white question" and said that her son along with other veterans of the war "return a little different, hardened, come back with the question whether there is the respect for which the soldiers, pilots, other soldiers fought."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against women, preventing him from attempting to report domestic violence, carrying a gun in a drunken state, according to the report.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new policy on the provision of a haven.
Eighteen states and the county of Columbia have backed the challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies harbour victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington to support the dispute over the port's provisioning policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the source in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was opened in August by the U.S. Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hardcore gang" raped her, but U.S. authorities on July 20 refused at the resort.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries with the highest number of requests for asylum in the U.S. as having serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on the harbour changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for the harbour.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Carl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislative experience of states, countries and the world.”
"Federal law requires that port applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analytical note says.
Lawyers also said in a note that a policy that rejects immigrants is deteriorating the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and “create the necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Refugee is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Sessions said on June 11, announcing this policy.
The refuge has never meant a solution to the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue work in Palu. During attempts to find the survivors, the number of dead doubled
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"Everything is very tense," says 35-year-old Rice Kusum's mother, reassuring her young son with the temperature in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the car brings the bodies in a ‘fast’ way.
Clean water is very little.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes, dismantling wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Pawl Army Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street for repeated severe strokes.
There were tears in his eyes when he recalled the feeling of the strong underground thrusts in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to escape.
I was trapped under the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "threats" using "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page ad in the U.S. daily, commending the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Peking of "discrimination."
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the paid appendix China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the state’s best-selling newspaper Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election.October 6 Letter
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the U.S. election pointed to what U.S. officials called a new phase in Washington's campaign of pressure on China in talks with Reuters.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war, resulting in the mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, according to U.S. and Chinese experts, have been put in place to harm exporters like businessmen from Iowa state who support Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstead wrote in a Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the good American tradition of free speech and free press to print paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstead wrote.
"And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you will find not so many votes against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that can have the Chinese about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers refused to print the offer" of his article, although he did not name it.
Republicans are pushing women-electors ahead of midterm elections from Kavanaugh's Fiasco, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans are defending the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will be hit in the back, especially by women, who are under the influence of the law.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most Republicans have already shown that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," said Grant Ryhar, a professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University's School of Political Science, to the issue of "The Hill" for an article that was printed on Saturday.
Richard said he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)'s statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the progressive group MoveOn, to a newspaper from Washington.
On Friday morning, protesters scanned "November quickly!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite the statement of Dr. Bryce.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be extremely great," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a Supreme Court candidate in sexual violence, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on affirmations, there may be a strong blow in response.
“For the Republican Party, this has become a bit of a mess,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“The talk is not about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets the job. The talk is about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it,” commented the news channel Guy Cecil.
However, it is similar to the fact that the Americans were divided on the question of Ford's or Kavanaugh's rights, and the reason is a little more than the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are likely or not very sure they trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they are likely or not very sure they trust Cowano.
In addition, 38 percent said that in their opinion, Cavanaugh may have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The FBI is investigating the accusations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, when drunk, was pursuing her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party when they were studying at Eileen in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch the New Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is launching a startup that will rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that when he created Inrupt, he meant "domination of the world".
"You have to do it now," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of things, calendar, fanatics, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this “personal enhancement of potential with the help of data.”
In the opinion of the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers working on the contract project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs, using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brners-Lee said he and his team had not talked to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make full changes when all of their business models were instantly reviewed.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium's issue, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in promoting net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honoring a Priest Rewarded by the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War as a combat participant, was celebrated in his city after 100 years.
Commander-in-Chief Bernard Van was rewarded on 29 September 1918 for his involvement in the Belenghiz and Leacourt attacks.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, in the town of Rushden, County Northamptonshire, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone at the parade.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opens exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Wang led his battalion through the San Quentin Canal "through a thick mist and under the fierce rifle and bullet fire of the enemy."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, grasping the gun on his own and knocking out the three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and just over a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather's actions were "something I would never have been able to do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, also made the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many give."
Fans of MMA waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's lead.
Just imagine, you've been standing back all night to watch a packed broadcast from Bellator 206, and then you're denied a view of the main event.
The program from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they aired live all night on the British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerard Moussa and Rory McDonald were preparing for the clash, spectators in the UK were simply shocked when the program changed to Pep's lead.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, especially awaiting this fight.
One of the dancers on Twitter called the switch to a children's cartoon as "someone's stupid joke."
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: “According to a state decree at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and needed to be switched to a children’s program.”
“Yeah, Peppa Pig.”
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said that in the future they will be working on the program to take into account British viewers.
"I think we're discussing the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, we can solve this issue," Cocker said.
“But it’s now 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we won’t be able to fix it until Sunday on our time, and it’s Monday on their time.
But we're doing our best.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the issue, considering that it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a government decision.
I can assure you that this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to please the fans, but we tried too hard.
That’s a sad situation.”
"Discs of an Uninhabited Island": Tom Daley felt "minor" because of sexuality
Olympic water-jumping fan Tom Daley said he grew up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality — but that gave him motivation on his way to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discs of an Uninhabited Island" program in the lead role of Lauren Lawrence, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a break for a few months due to the illness.
In the role of a man who found himself on an uninhabited island, on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as a child he felt "less" than everyone else, because "civilization did not accept those who liked both boys and girls".
He said, “I still believe that this feeling that you are not like everything and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he did not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics has become a major activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year urged countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate to live openly, without persecution, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – an American screenwriter, director and producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daley married Oscar's owner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he says the age difference doesn't matter.
“If you go through this at such a young age” – at the first Olympiad he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer – he said that it was difficult to find an equalizer who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son's name was Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "prospects" had completely changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.”
His son is also named after his father, Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to sit in the first row, Dad,'" he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of my balloons at the Olympics, that’s the best feeling,” he said.
This also influenced the choice of the song – Proud from Heather Small – which found in it a review in preparation for the Olympics and from which ants are still running.
"Discs of the Uninhabited Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, who is not in shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to get back in shape so that the event doesn't turn out to be unhappy.
Michaelsen, who will play in this competition, which is held every two years, a record 12 times, team captain Jim Furyk sat on the bench for Saturday's forbols.
Instead of being at the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time winner of the Cup split his days between the work of the leader and the training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer isn't the perfect choice for a tricky Le Golf National field, where he is severely punished by inaccurate punches.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Michelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact champion of the British Open Francesco Malinara, who together with Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are behind by four points in the first 12 singles matches, start with success, the match of Michelson can be extremely important.
Fryk expressed confidence in this player, but couldn't say anything more.
“He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, slapped me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He’s very confident in himself.
He was admitted to the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan for two games.
I wanted to do more, but that's how we played.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Michelson will break Nick Fald's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never been the same as the achievements in individual games.
Michaelsen had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence had benefited the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to joke about people and just a very good person to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were delighted to parry his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see that.
It gives the team much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Byrne knows that a major breakthrough could soon go away.
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, from experience knows that a significant break before the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup, can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the European team led by Sev Balesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum advantage of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You’re constantly reminding yourself that at Golf we had a great advantage and won at Walder, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage at Brooklyn where we lost,” said Byrne after viewing it as a Class of 2018 team won 5-3 and 5-6 on Friday.
"The story shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end.
We're going to have to play 100 tomorrow.
Go out on the field and do it right.
Until the points appear in the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, which is what we will focus on.
I’m constantly saying this, I’m focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side there are the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players played on a tough golf course, Björn added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow's going to be a different game.
There's going to be an individual game tomorrow, and that's quite different.
It's just great when you're on the field with a partner and everything is going well, but if you play alone, then here are your true golfer's talents.
Here's what you need to tell the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, we have to go and also show everything better as an individual player.”
Unlike Börn, his rival Jim Furyk hopes for a better individual game for his athletes than the one they have demonstrated in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spita and Justine Thomas, who have taken three.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these matches on the last day, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering a question about how Ben Craneshaw, captain of 1999, had set his players up for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start that you have seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the speed increases, the greatest pressure is put on those who play the games in the middle.
We made the appropriate schedule and put the players in the way we liked. You know, tomorrow we're trying to get a little magic."
Thomas has been tasked to start playing and plays against Rory McIlroy in the lead match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rom, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter will play against top golfers.
"I've put my players in that order because I think that's how I'm going to close everything," Björn said of his choice for individual matches.
The arrival of a new German ship has been delayed.
The new frigate of the German Navy had to enter service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to malfunctioning systems and a steady increase in prices.
The descent of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to enter service in 2014, but the problems that emerged after construction hampered this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class warships, ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between the maintenance – more new frigates may not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships – which could allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad – will become obsolete as long as they finally get into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unhappy frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have written about the many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships had only 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of the ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the missing equipment, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – although initially it amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that are accumulating with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, said the Navy “has less and less ships capable of military missions.”
He said that the problem is increasing over time because the old ships are being scrapped and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Memorials listened to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of the unique flying milkweeds and help in future actions on the conservation of these animals.
A study by scientists of the National Society for the Protection of Monuments in Scotland deals with small bats and also the long-lived bats of Dubanton in the Invery Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this place to monitor the actions of bats throughout the season.
The company's employees and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings determines the frequency of bat calls, as well as what bats are doing.
A residence map and a report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dwyer, an adviser to the National Society for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to support forests for living bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work, which affects the place of residence and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also endangered by domestic cats.
They're not blind at all.
However, because of their nightlife, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check-ups of places of residence and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish bat reserve in the Trinity Monastery in Dumfries and Galway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The head of the monastery David Thompson says that this is the perfect territory for bats.
"Here, at Triv, we just have a great place for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don't know much about bats, so our work here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need for a better life."
It underlines the importance of checking for bats before carrying out property repairs, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy one saddle, killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are said to be under protection and are prohibited from killing, scaring, disturbing or destroying their saddles.
Elizabeth Farrell, an employee of the Bat Protection Organisation in Scotland, is calling on the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many of the species we don't even know how their populations live."
Ronaldo has been accused of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called his accusations of rape "fake news", saying that people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus were charged with raping American Katherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 for her silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed 142 million of his subscribers hours after publishing the allegations, calling the post “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to make an advertisement in my name.
That's ok.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
"I'm a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine over the charges, which they called “an unacceptable report of suspicions in a private case,” Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Herz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damage in the amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights."
It was as if the incident had taken place in June 2009 in the suite room of the Palms Hilton and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Major seem to have returned to a footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as written in the Clark County District Court documents in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after that Ronaldo kneeled and said that at "99 percent" he was "a good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but by agreement of the parties.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried about being "publicly brought down".
A 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the charge because she feels a moral trauma in the case.
At the time, as if this case had a place, Ronaldo was going to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing the deal in 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will "forever regret" the loss of car makers
Britain will "forever regret" losing its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said on Wednesday.
He added that he was “concerned” by Toyota UK’s statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at its Bernaston plant, near Derby, in half.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay in the border as a result of no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Barnaston, home to Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO in Barnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised the question of how the cross-border trade will take place if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to the fact that automakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "accurate timeline" basis when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be interruptions at the border, leading to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota it will be impossible to keep the plant in Derby more than a day's supply of parts, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clarke said that Theresa May’s “Checkers Plan” on future relations with the EU was “made precisely to avoid these border checks.”
“We need an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that will not only allow today’s success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said in the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, suggests that we should be able to continue to work on successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will not work, but has warned for the future that the added cost will reduce the factory's competitiveness and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Barnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the trade union, said that the union members are very concerned: "I ask you if jobs are cut, they will not be renewed.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a clear plan for our future relations with the EU that is credible.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week,” while the fight around the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Covano, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russia's interference in elections, the connections of Trump's aides to Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump dismisses the Assistant Attorney General and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence, he has been pouring oil into the fires of Washington's flares for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of 25 amendments.
Rosenstein denied it.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would take place on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes at a hearing in the Senate Legal Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the allegation against Kavanaugh, which further slowed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not yet scheduled, perhaps, this week, perhaps, the next. I think that, rather, a week later, taking into account all the other things that have a place in the matter.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the most up-to-date information.”
Some journalists are willing to challenge her claim: Sanders has not held press briefings in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the head of the program, asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarity of briefings was caused by not scorning television reporters who "work for the public", although she added: "I will agree with the fact that they work for the public."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more meetings with replies to press questions than any president who has been before him,” she said, adding without specific facts: “We’ve studied these numbers.”
Briefings are taking place, Sanders said, but “when the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it’s much better than doing it through me.
We try to do this often, you have seen how we have done this in the last few weeks. Such meetings, at which you can ask a question directly to the president, replace briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
The President's own press conferences are seldom held.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, if freely and sometimes extravagantly, he appeared before reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's system of health protection against Brexit.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's health care system to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them to remain after Brexit.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of residence applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal of our country continued over the summer. They lead to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for the scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a very stressful time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you how much I value the contribution of each worker, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health care service, also benefiting patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Cristiano Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a Sunday game his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He went over to the sidelines and suddenly fell,” Reed said.
Coaches and medics gave Oberkombi oxygen on the field before putting it on the force and moving it for diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no "detail of what the injury was" and Tennessee State was trying to identify when the player was injured.
Ambercombe, a second-year athlete, spends his first season outside of Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving only 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher tax rate.
According to the new plan of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher duty, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes taking the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters.
Increasing taxes will affect those who don't pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Today, Theresa May announces that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state tax, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative on attracting young voters, as well as providing affordable housing. It is aimed at high-income people.
The increase in the state duty is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's program of providing housing to the homeless.
Increasing the current state duty, including higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and housing for rent, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, this leads to price hikes and new buyers are finding it difficult to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “private cities”, because a large number of buyers from abroad do not live in the UK most of the time.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce state tolls for young buyers to make it easier to buy the first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding high real estate prices by seizing the land and not using it, and called on Ms. May to abolish the quotas on affordable housing to remedy the "disgraceful" situation from
Mr. Corbyn announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including controlling rents and stopping "unlawful" eviction.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in the area of housing construction.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
This is to improve our inadequate housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not reside in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as the working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.”
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his main ambition was to become the coach of the Scottish national team someday.
The 42-year-old Scottish performs the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, at three points from the first.
He moved on to the job in the summer after returning St. Mary's to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“I grew up often sick for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that's a chance I'll have when I'm a successful club coach."
Among Rosa's predecessors in the position of coach "Sunderland" Dick Attorney, David Moses, Sam Alardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poie and Paul Di Kanya.
Former coach Aloa Athletic says he did not feel afraid of such famous names in such a large club, previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Now, success for me will be the answer to the question, ‘Can I return this club to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is probably in the Premier League," he said.
"I'm not just going to get him back there, but I'm going to consider my work successful only if I can get the club back there."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at Harts Headquarters.
He then helped Aloe return from the third league and turned Saint-Marin into a loser who nearly made it to the Champions League in the next season's win.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academic.
Reminiscent of work at Aloe, he said, "It was a really important choice."
“I really believed that coaching work is what I need, even more than a game.
It sounds amazing, because I've worked well, made good money and achieved certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do each week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what you need.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, and for me it’s the best time of my adult life.”
The full interview can be listened to on Sportssound on Saturday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British summer time.
According to the study, the perfect time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer has increased the profits of British bars struggling for survival, but has put pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to statistics, the group of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants, sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA 2 business consultancy group, which compiled these statistics, said: "The long sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English team in the final of the World Championship, mean that in July, the odds are more than expected.
The decline in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell drinks, have so far shown the best result unlike restaurants.
Pubs that sell more food are also hot in the sun, although not as strong as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent, and food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM analyst on recreation and placement, said: “These results are becoming the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's no wonder that restaurants continue to struggle, as sales have fallen by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when prices are steadily rising.
A long and hot summer has come at the worst time for food-focused operators, and time will tell if lower temperatures in August will bring such an expected relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand rollout.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they're hiding from their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some of them only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that it hides from parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
This article is about the fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "basic" account that shows their parents
One in five children, some of them only 11 years old, creates accounts on social networks that are kept secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid rise in “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to an Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept "clean" "core" accounts to show their parents, and they also kept private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that she called others “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of directors of independent schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of teens between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very disturbing that so many teens want to create places on the internet where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eileed Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a supervisory member of the council at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle – Scotland’s most-titled lightweight athlete and President Ian Beatie described this event as a great opportunity for those who manage sports, to benefit a lot from her experience at a variety of levels, including international over the past year.
“Eileen enjoys great respect in Scotland, the UK and the world athletic community, and we are confident that light athletics in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the council,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to help manage sports in Scotland."

I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I am going to get better and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm doing agile exercises!

The ad of a milk pump, where mothers are compared to cows, shared opinions on the internet
The company for the production of milk pumps shared the opinion, releasing an advertisement that compares breastfeeding women with cows who are breastfeeding.
To mark the launch of what’s called the “world’s first pumped milk” consumer company Elvie has released an Iranian music ad based on a video to showcase the freedom this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers are dancing in a row with cows under a song, where there are such words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And he said, Give, give, I will feed the children, give, give, I will give my wives.
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a heated debate on the internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said it was a horror of dairy production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth to give birth to milk, but only their children are taken out in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump hides imperceptibly in breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Of course traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise a milk pump for a mother who doesn’t have children?”
He said, “It’s such an inconceivable advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman wrote that she considers the song "fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was breastfeeding.
The fact that I'm sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
“It’s a great product,” she wrote.
Another comment: “Very entertaining ads aimed at mothers who suck milk with a pump (often at work or in the toilet) and hear themselves as ‘cows’.
“This is not a bad thing, and it is not a bad thing.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in bra.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps, feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes and hides imperceptibly in a bra for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children and even leave the house during the day.
Ana Balaryn, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
In parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to suction of milk and its difficulties, while demonstrating in a fun and enjoyable way how the new dairy pump will bring extraordinary freedom to the cow.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been in the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium in the clothes of Martha Jakubovsky, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being transported to tent camps on the border with Texas
Although the number of border crossings per month has barely changed, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies carried out by the Trump administration, which have burdened the placement.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to jeopardize their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of households would need to file fingerprints and the data would be forwarded to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthias Albanes, a high-ranking immigration and customs official, spoke to Congress with a report on the arrests of dozens of people who have applied for the request to sponsor minors without consent.
It was later reported in the agency that 70% of those arrested previously had no trials.
“About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal history.
That’s why we continue to persecute such people,” Mr. Albens said.
To speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, with, according to shelter workers, the earlier standard term being 60 days.
A large number of people will have to use video communication to file a claim for their own legal status to the immigration judge, rather than attending the court in person.
Those who don't have a good reason to help are quickly dismissed.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have appeared in the last few months, the longer children remain in captivity, the higher the likelihood of developing depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to anxiety.
Lawyers argue that in larger institutions such as Tarnilla, these problems are much more pronounced, as the signs that the child is in good shape are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent towns without providing time for emotional training or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many have already encountered.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of "occupied forces" of the United States, France and Turkey
In an appeal to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhammad also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that has been going on in the country for eight years.
Mualem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil on the basis of combating terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
“They must leave immediately and without putting any conditions,” he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have had to abandon their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus intends to continue "to carry out this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mainly serving as instructors and advisers to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land-based contingent in this war-torn country consists of more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions for the return were favorable and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that detain refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he says.
"They're politicizing an exceptionally humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the recovery until a political agreement on an end to the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major backing of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by the Syrian forces backed by Russia against a province where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "accurate terms", and expressed the hope that the military actions will be directed against the jihadists, including militants from the "al-Qaeda"-related Nusra front.
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in the near future, to draft a subsequent constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited "by reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warning of interference.
Why Trump is Going to a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, when, as many liberal spectators hope, the impeachment and scandal will not end his presidency in a timely manner.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all of history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, the ratings in prime time have more than doubled – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers on live stream, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" of the channel MSNBC gathered at the screen 3.5 million viewers and exceeded the rating.
“This is the fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” says Neil Beer, director of the ABC drama Pereemnick, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scowell, the mastermind of the comedy writer and author of “A Couple of Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys Club,” there is another theory.
She mentions a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he's cheering me up," Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is also something that can be enjoyed.
Of course, unlike the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington can become as defining a future as the Row v. Wade case, depending on whether the immigrant families will be able to survive.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.

When I spoke to Mr. Flees this week, behind the windows of his house on the north shore of Cowai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't hurt himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging on his shoulders.
“I remember the days when we were releasing these crazy shows, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flees told me.

External cash flows are pouring into the tough pre-election race of the interim elections to the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Electoral District was covered by a bay of money due to the change in the boundaries of the counties introduced by Congress, which is why two candidates participate in the election for one seat.
The recently redesigned suburban area of Pittsburgh surrounds a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another county in the election last spring.
Lambo is opposed by another incumbent MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th county of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally taken into account in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the company's funding by the financial groups of the main parties, the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (CDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NCRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely enlightened election in the 18th District of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with a 20-point break.
The Democrats have a very small advantage over the Democrats.
The U.S. assessed the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing's position, despite the slight opposition from Washington, the statement said.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners displaced Mr. Trump's leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan," the press secretary said.
However, the sanctions were considered only in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts to financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and homicides.
At the conclusion of the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which would be a continuation of a similar meeting in the course of the meeting.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration continued to understand that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pension will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is advocating for the event.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or punishments from Washington, D.C.
The White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by another, close to the administration analyst, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the history
The next step could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice to Mr Trump, on examples of what is currently very hard evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in an attack on the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the electorate, and perhaps, in the end, to the jury of his colleagues.
There are many “whens” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, just as it is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
"We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next few years of bloodshed.
The story revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
Right now, Americans are facing a number of these turning points.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was written in the newspaper that last year he had secretly proposed to record the president's words and considered his impeccability.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the FBI's recent inquiry into the case of Brett Kavanaugh is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is approved in the Supreme Court, despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the congressional elections that will bring Mr. Trump to account?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prada.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz in the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial house.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on this table with a swastika.

Graham Dorans of the Rangers optimistically tuned ahead of the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are accepting the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to safely exit the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorans to play for the first time in the season 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard.
“It was an important game for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we earned a point.
Maybe we could have scored the ball in the end, but in general nothing was a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took our hands and we had the best half of the field.
There will be another important European football game on Thursday night.
I hope we can earn three points, but it will be a difficult game as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans on the stands, I'm sure we will be able to resist them and show them.
"Last year was definitely a tough year, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope that we can move forward, surpass the result of last season and achieve success.”
Women are losing their sleep because of fear of retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had an accurate idea of what they wanted to care for themselves, few of them spoke about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss it,” says Holly Snyder, Nationalwide’s vice president of life insurance.
That's where it's worth starting.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with the consultant and the family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get in touch with a financial adviser; he can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or you can self-insured that your life is in – you die.
Resolve matters with legal documents: foreseen court battles.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Regency, a district north of the Pole, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Dongala is a regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency is an administrative unit with a status below the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activity of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongguan.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morava, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Mitigation of Natural Disasters, Palu and the Dongal have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck the western part of the Dongkal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic-active Pacific Rim of Fire and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the deaths along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean and over 2,000 people.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: In Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 occurred on one of the islands of Mentha outside Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Pyja Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the devastation resulting from the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lambok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-candidate to President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin from Wassily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted reports of domestic violence and opposition to the arrest, published on Saturday by the state police.
According to a police report, when one acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the channel "KTUU", Palin is located in the insulator Matanuska-Susitna under a $ 500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "precisely innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which threaten him with imprisonment for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a case has been filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is currently under review by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for her son's harsh behavior with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and grid connections are not working, and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake took place near central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
On social media, video clips have been circulated that show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor's office is demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York terror attack.
The New York Federal Prosecutor’s Office is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of the New York terror attack, which killed eight people – a rare punishment that was not used in the state for 19 federal crimes.
Saipav, 30, in October allegedly used the hired truck of the company "Home Depot" to climb a bicycle lane along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and riding.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the announcement of the intention to achieve the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipav "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally"
According to the court's findings, both offences may be punishable by the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury investigated Ashlomila Siipova's submission of a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder in support of a racket; this point is usually exonerated.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "delayed and deliberate planning", and in describing the crimes committed by Saip, they used phrases such as "disgusting, harsh and demeaning".
"Saifula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and caused losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nikolas Kleves, Anna Laura Decodt, Dorena Drake, Ariel Hernández
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last criminal case with the death penalty was opened in the Southern District of New York, according to the New York Times.
Prosecutor Haleed Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York was applied in a federal case was in 1953 before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple punished after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy on the purpose of pornography.
The Rosenberg couple were sentenced to life imprisonment on June 19, 1953.
Saipav, a native of Uzbekistan, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of conscience in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said he was delighted with what he had done.
According to the accused's detention, Saipov told authorities that the attack was inspired by a video of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to display the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room, police said.
He does not plead guilty to the indictment, which consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were "absolutely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” Patan said.
In the meantime, the San Diego Police Department has urged prosecutors not to resort to the death penalty.
A member of parliament from the Torah says Nigel Farage should appoint a Brexit negotiation.
Today, during a protest at a Torah party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel discomfort" from eurosceptics - as a member of parliament, Theresa May, proposed her candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of parliament from the Conservative Party, Peter Boone, said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would already "go out" if Lord Farage held the post of Secretary for Brexit.
But the problem that May faced trying to reconcile her dissenting supporters was further exacerbated when the Tories, who advocated EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister tries to keep the Cheker Agreement under constant pressure from the supporters and opponents of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between a package and a "no deal".
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Salihalla "Leave Means Leave" that he wanted "to throw the Checker off the board".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made equal and assume responsibilities for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit, but we need to move away from the Cheker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone dismissed assumptions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue."
A supporter of Brexit and member of the Torah, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march, and in an interview with journalists, she said: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Cheker’s plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out and voting for us.
“Please stop and start listening to me.”
In a sharp appeal to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain in office when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that politicians need to be made to "feel discomfort" when they are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘This won’t go away from you.’”
Speaking to the crowd, he added: “I want you to make our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-made, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists waved the banners of the Tories Against Brexit (Tories vs. Brexit) after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's peer Lord Adanis fought over the Conservatives over the security concerns they had encountered over the program for the opening of the conference party.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT system and all the technology ready for Canada plus, for the border without exercise, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a farce.
“There’s no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to pay full attention to the process of running for President of the United States.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “pay full attention to the process of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from the state of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a general meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to run for re-election, opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Dil, who was Trump's senior campaigner in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it was the 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general meeting that took place on Saturday in Haliok.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for the post of president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to repair a broken government, and for this a woman must be at the forefront."
The arrest took place after the death of basketball player Simse from the University of Louisiana team.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of USL basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditan Simpson during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking them to help identify the person who appeared on it.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot dead on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head as a result of which he died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters at 247sports on Saturday.
Wade pleaded for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the interrogation, Simpson confessed that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist detention and was taken into custody at the East Button Row County Police Department.
A 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) adult junior athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on the pitch from the beginning, on average, he spent on the pitch, 2 hours, 6 minutes, 5 minutes.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton has come close to the title of world champion after having won the victory over Sebastian Fethelm by an intra-team deal
From the moment Walter Bottas anticipated the qualifying race of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders within the Mercedes team play a significant role in the race.
Bottas pulled out a good spot on the rookie and nearly left Hamilton at the mercy of fate until he defended his spot on the first two of the wires and invited Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton to wrestle at the end of the overall mass of riders, it was this maneuver that had to become decisive.
The pilot of the "Marsedes" went on a pit-stop for a lap later and came out behind the fetish, but Hamilton came out ahead after several round-to-round maneuvers, which forced the driver of the "Ferrari" to leave the interior space.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led the majority of the race while holding the tyres, as he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Raikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed on the remaining eight rounds, so Raikanen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Walter performed fantastically all weekend and proved himself to be a real gentleman, if I'm allowed to say so.
"The team has done a great job of taking first and second place," Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Finstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leak of Christina Blaise Ford's letter, in which she accused Bhutto of accusing the candidate in Vyasa.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly the statements made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate showed how people can be "unworthy, unworthy".
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diana Finstein, is that your escape?
Remember her answer ... you lost the document – “Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Wait a minute, then.
We let go... No, we did not let go,” he added, admonishing the senator.
Finstein was sent a letter in July detailing the accusations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and he fled in early September – but Finstein denied that the escape had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t let her story escape,” Finstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the story confidential, and I satisfied her request.”
But her refusal probably displeased the president, who so commented on it during the Saturday rally: “This is what I’m going to tell you, it was really bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of a candidate in the Supreme Court accused of sexual assault by three women, the president made the assumption that Democrats are using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by any means.
You see the vileness, the uglyness, and they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to pass through to get power and control,” he said.

Air traffic controller dies after rescuing hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia heroically died, ensuring the successful take-off of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared without a trace after a massive earthquake on Sulawesi island on Friday triggered a tsunami.
Strong underground rushes are still going on, and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were being rescued by the fugitives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was swinging wildly at the Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained in place until the Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway at the time, landed on the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided that it was going to be destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program "ABC News", according to the representative of "Air Navigation Indonesia" Johanes Sirait, the decision of the shipper, possibly saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which had to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached the Pole.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach several thousand, and the agency to reduce the risk of natural disasters claims that access to the city of Dongla, Sigismund and Bouton is limited.
The representative of the agency Sutop Purva Nugroh reported: "Perhaps the number of victims will continue to increase, as many bodies have still not been able to dig from the debris."
The blasts, which reached up to six meters, devastated the Pole, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes are carrying humanitarian aid to the country.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a car ‘fast’ brings bodies.
There is no clean water.
There are shops all over the place.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who have survived, but we don’t know what awaits them here.
It's a tragedy, but everything can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jok Vidoda arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the troops: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia had already suffered from earthquakes in Lambok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: according to "Air Niugini" one person disappeared without news after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that made the emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the crew were happy to evacuate from the plane, which crashed, and now is missing.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday, it could not give a report on the location of one of the passengers, a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuvk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unclear.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon, not reaching the fateful lane.
According to some reports, the plane has jumped over the runway.
According to U.S. passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It's very successful," Janes said.
According to him, he and others were able to break through the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which had already sunk.
He said that the guards panicked and started screaming, and that he had a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the marshals who had rammed near the docks also helped with the rescue, using an inflated boat to carry people to shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the crash of Papua New Guinea-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
Analyst recovers the course of events in the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment concluded the submission of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlet has for a number of hours given indications as an attracted expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used tapes from mobile phones to learn about the movements of 29-year-old respondent Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Roulette, he received information about the location from several mobile phones that showed that Talis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous statement.
When the information that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone at the time, when he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, was confirmed, police headed for Sanford.
Sanford gave the demonstration on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telis was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that night, he said that he was "lies since my van was in Nashville."
Another controversy was Tellis's claim that he was acquainted with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Records from mobile phones showed that they had known each other for a week.
According to Roulette, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He's driven her out of her life," Haley said.
The defense side should start the disputes between the sides on Sunday.
According to the judges, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later that day.

There's another black one?!
Babysitter from New York sues a couple for a "Russian" message after being fired
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a randomly sent message from a mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the gaps to "extortion".
In 2016, Lensy Plasca-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
“NO, THAT’S A SHARKSKURA,” Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As the New York Post reports, after understanding the error, Plasca-Flaxman "feeled incompetence" and fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, was doing poorly at work, and that she was waiting for her job.
Ms. Morris paid a day's work and was sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing a couple and wants to receive compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months of residence.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday. “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied the allegations of racism, arguing that releasing Maurice was a reasonable decision, given that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent me something I shouldn’t have told her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said Post’s husband, Joel Plasca.
“Would you trust your children because you’ve dealt with them rudely, even by chance?
"Your baby?
Is it?”
Plaska equates the gap to "extortion" and reports that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to start chasing a man like that?
It’s pretty tough,” – added the specialist on investment-banking activity.
Although the judicial review is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social networks, exposing them to harsh criticism of their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not overlive the bear who is talking, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's so interesting to read it, already knowing about Paddington's great success."
She told that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not accepted and added that the 60-year-old was the publisher of the book.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
“He was a fairly quiet man, and not at all praiseworthy,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a fatherly honor for a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not really your merit.
I think that's the key to Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave what belonged to Paddington himself.”
My daughter died, and I had to talk to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
“I called over regularly to tell her that everything was really bad, that she couldn’t stand it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tasha, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to frighten her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was unfolding.
I couldn't cry, cry, or cry, because there were families and people around me.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednán-Laperuz, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with the other passengers – and they did not know at all what she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and there were tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a sense of compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are saddened put out cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, are doing everything they can to ensure that other people do not take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a bridge in Wales with warm words and phone numbers on which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he became depressed, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I feel,” she said.
The 45-year-old Lady Davis, who lives in Lydda, said her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him smiling.
People said that his smile would illuminate any room.”
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly concerned that this could have unpleasant consequences."
Mrs. Davis created the cards, “so that people know that there are such people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Hasfrys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday, he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
She said that his death was a big trauma for them, but had to live with it: "There was a big hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But you have to live and fight.”

The future of Brad Kavanaugh is uncertain, because the FBI is beginning an investigation
“I thought we could have what he wants – a time-limited and scoped investigation – we could get some reconciliation,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was “dismantling” because of the fact that the committee had failed.
"Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their unwillingness is sometimes explained.
Interim elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to suffer parasites, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the Supreme Court candidate they need.
George W. Bush called a senator to discuss the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then a personal secretary of the Bush administration.
What's going to happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equality of votes and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea has declined under Kim's leadership.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo-sung, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said there were 1,127 survivors last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main reasons are the strengthened border controls between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers have set for the reform.
Pyongyang has not commented on this.
Most of the refugees from the North have the right to obtain the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily protected.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This took place after a historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed in a joint deadline to work on the goal of fully freeing the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Yang Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm," Mr. Rhea said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh 'hysterical', she says he shouldn't work in Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that by his temperament he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called a hysterectomy,” Pelosi told the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment to Dr. Cristina Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when his family and senior grades were discussed.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a “grateful and organized killing of a person” organized by liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's speech showed that he can't work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he has a preference against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try the impeachment of Kavanaugh, if he was elected and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he should not only not work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavanaugh is a judge at the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Medicine Act or the Row v. Wade case because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for hysterical, unobjective individuals to work in court and expect us to say ‘how wonderful it is,’” Pelosi said.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified accusation speech, months and years of anger just overflowing, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Staine told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued: “I was very much helped by a woman who worked somewhere as a director, and who said that when she got angry, she cried, but developed a behavioral technique. When she got angry and began to cry, I said to the interviewer, “You cry.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept on talking.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as an output of the amount, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of my first job, on which I once cried with unspeakable anger, then I was grabbed by an elderly woman behind the canvas – a restrained boss who always scared me a little – and dragged me.
“Never let them see you in tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad to have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman-democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was caught on a wedding betrayal on a yacht called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, very angry Mrs. Schroeder felt that she herself could participate in the presidential campaign.
“It wasn’t a very well thought out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates already, and they didn’t need me at all.
Someone called this situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the company has been going for quite a long time, it did not have enough funds, so she said she would not take part in the election unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who donated $1000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so strongly captured by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system, which has made it so difficult to receive money and directed it to the electorate – I did not.
"You might think I have a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her condition.
“You might have thought that my corporate sponsor is the paper towel manufacturer Kleenex.
I've always wondered what they're going to write on the top of my head.
“She was crying?”
Why the trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first waves of a trade war between China and the U.S. were overwhelming, and since the war is far from over, far-reaching misunderstandings between countries could be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs hit goods totalling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised a symmetrical response to the United States, and the second-largest economy will hardly lead.
In order to force Washington to withdraw, it is necessary to dig deeper into the demand, but the public leaning towards the United States is virtually unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the long run could support China, reducing the interdependence of the two countries.
“The fact that a swift political solution in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than the observers previously thought,” said Abigail Grace, an assistant professor at the University of Washington.
Syria "ready" for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhammad said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to return to normal life.
We now have all the conditions for the return of refugees to the country, which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and directed economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and means of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muhammad said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country will not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or aid from countries that have sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who most competed in the tournament, drove his ball into the water for 3 pairs of the 16th hole, defeating this match of Francesca Malinara.
Italian golfer Molinari played well in all rounds, becoming one of four players to pass this field with a 5-0-0 since the start of the tuner in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with 5th and 4th lowest-rated player in the European team, Thornburn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter from England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the player who has the most wins in the tournament with a career number of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get my cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said Garcia, shocked by the European team’s victory.
He handed the relay over to his compatriot John Rama, who lost to American golfer Tiger Woods in a solo 2&1 match on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I've been following since I was a kid," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record number of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The amazing stats of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and is lagging behind only Jack Nicholas on this indicator.
The American team competed with each other except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tina Finn, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning, we showed Europe what we are capable of.
We were wrestling.
We take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We have been strayed.”
