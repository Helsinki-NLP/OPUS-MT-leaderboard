Members of the National Assembly of Wales worried that they will be "compared to Muppets"
Members of the National Assembly of Wales are in turmoil over a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will be ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said MWP “rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Plaid Party’s National Assembly of Wales said the group as a whole is “dissatisfied” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who are taking the final decision on their new title.”
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country’s name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an impending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
Proponents of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's are silent, those of Harlem are having a hard time
“The older people I spoke to said that here used to be a cafe and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is no café or church to be seen here.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly pass by.”
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the church’s assets will last less as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back to the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people who would live would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will cause these churches to close even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the beaver "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the beard in July referred to the instrument in a different way: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beaver in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beaver of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would "want to pass on the costs" to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Who Dive to Shrimps in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the shrimp season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who appeared to shrimp in California. The boy suffered injuries, it says.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with a few others, he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was shouting because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘that the boy was shouting: ‘I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!"
His keybone was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beachwatch captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species living in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow while sales of fashion and household items continue to fall. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced into even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s aims to double its beauty offerings and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gains more space, with exhibition space per brand, as in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also bringing its Boutique makeup back to market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores of Sainsbury's. The former is opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury’s, says the stores will look more and more like grocery stores, now that the supermarket chain is picking up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, food sales have increased as a result and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmacy a makeover, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested out a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in stores three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the layout of our beauty department to make it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'furious' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is sometimes compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby, because she has withdrawn at the last minute from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when Willoughby announced on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she was not spending enough time on Truly, their homewear and accessories brand, due to her new contracts (valued at as much as <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million).
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones moved to one of his vacation homes abroad.
One source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would secure her future in the long run, and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now suffer further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became Chairman of the company in March.
The couple often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the program I'm A Celebrity on the UK broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones's entourage said last night: "We have no comment on his business affairs."
Hard language ‘and then there was love between us’
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “unfit for a president,” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
Negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told U.N. General Assembly leaders that North Korea sees no “consequential response” by the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
The United States, meanwhile, continues to impose sanctions to keep pressure on the boiler, he said.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We’re doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: rocket tests have ended, hostages have been freed, and the physical surpluses of U.S. military personnel have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had housing, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for launching international aid.
“In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they are not asking for international aid, which is difficult for us,” Sumbung said.
Save the Children is working on setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the relief workers from abroad will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was in effect, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s unprecedented infrastructure was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent ample money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is facing a shortage of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority now follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting in the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool secures impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his squad was behind 1-0.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked towards the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He evaded the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he hurried through the midfield to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet on the midfield.
Then he gave a nice pass, which allowed Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli, at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake of last Friday, which also caused waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, the body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they may have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying at the scene.
She keeps repeating, “What a shame!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the depot and a third was just outside.
Within the deposition, a number of officers were watching the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, mentioning log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue at the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' relay
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate about removing statues would lead to targeting the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs recognition today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and commemorated.”
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, whose only surname is known is ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stall at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, his artery was punctured and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, on May 30, 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He and his nephew traveled from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pig stable open.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pig’s mouth.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleed and mutilated,” said the nephew with the surname ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Images from surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived at the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they're not ready to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens now that it has reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will result in precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised not to walk into the desert when tropical rainfall is imminent.
Heavy rainfall can turn ravines into wild rivers, and storms will produce local windflags and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rains will spread further on Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the U.S. can fluctuate sharply as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the U.S., October is expected to warm, with temperatures swinging everywhere around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the odds are high for above-average temperatures in the eastern United States until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of six television networks on Thursday for the gripping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh stabbed her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking at an office.
For comparison, it’s like a football play-off or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which gives Kavanaugh’s appointment all support, had the most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters were yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He kept his eyes shut for a few minutes while he was being humiliated, live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judiciary committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” about Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s taxes was “absurd”.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed to having shot Wayde with the result of death.
His bail is set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The city's forensic examiner in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to the arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "captured" and "in shock" by Waydes' death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
The ash that is being spit out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times buzzing and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 hit the Richter scale in central Mexico.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists beat up riot police while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by the riot police baked the officers with eggs and powder dyes, causing dark dust clouds to form in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled their baton upstairs to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang, “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independent region, a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who are against separation boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt the vote in the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was that nipt, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. After all, many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in imprisonment the role of exile and in prison in awaiting their unity.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been heightened by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, declared that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to accuse the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was framed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
It is possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came on equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's squad failed to win a run-out during the Premiership this season, and they have to take on leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead of them, on Sunday.
But first, the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston has already won six games in a row in his division, and coach Holt hasn’t suffered a single defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt’s team could have made a head start long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it off with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team made the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston secured an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was insurmountable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a push by his colleagues from Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was constantly reached, but they were fired each time. Twice a penalty kick was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has floated up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Major Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to displace the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan to be received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police relied on security reasons when they stopped the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a car crash.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a flight-crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were engaged in identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed at various places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six prisoners injured in order disruption
Six prisoners have been injured in a disorderly manner in a heavily guarded men's prison, according to the prison office.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9.30 local time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized Tornado squads have been deployed to solve a situation in which eight prisoners are involved in one department.
The prisoners were treated there for light injuries in the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a recent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and at least those responsible are referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were summoned to prison for a serious disruption of order in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive consequences for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which carries risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be hanging over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will be raining on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be favorable, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map describing current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
The trajectory of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall can occur in parts of Mexico, with significant flood risk.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The biggest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded at about 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything about what happened to report.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Has Suffered Among the Community, the Anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has consistently "suffered under the community, the rage" of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people” saw Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and incredible character, quality and courage” that day.
“A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent standing,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he talked about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
“I’m not taking part, but I’m taking part,” he said.
“That’s why I come up with great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “provide resistance and hinder us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, a top GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and tolls are rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, sweeping many from the ground when giant waves hit the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high hit the land at the moment it began to dusk. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach, they didn’t immediately walk away and became the victim of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has further magnified the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatalities were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement. Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although staff said the waves had reached the land within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building in panic yelling at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently dispatching cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their offices are seeking shelter in tents of canopy, they passed scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency relief, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be admitted if the location of a disaster is declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people so delight to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours afterwards he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, in his messages only one gray tick appeared instead of two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver had just emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
If you have information about the identity of the perpetrators, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Changes His Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye for some time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Not only is Ye an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, we are it.
I’ve switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He’s not the only rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the emblem and capital letters.
Mexican President Promises Not to Use Armed Forces Against Civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people, during which leftist student movements erupted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
The U.S. Should Double A.I. Financing
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on AI research, says investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number one in AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat the best player of American Othello, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese division of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology contests organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China doesn’t pick up our best academics, companies do,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited the best forces from universities to work on AI.
Lee said U.S. AI efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Whoever is a doctor in the field of AI should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences is providing financial support to staff from academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are funding American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the U.S. legislation that should lead to the creation of a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been in turmoil for months.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Possible Name Change of Country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country in ‘Republic of North Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been dragged on for decades and would no longer allow Greece to apply for membership of the UN and the European Union.
Greece has a province that is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor implies that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed Macedonia's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
“Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at the time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs for tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a backdoor,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a “yes” as a result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short runs with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It seemed like a whistle of a penny, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian top scorer first got the ball played on the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from problems with his feet," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball with him for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just tipped the ball in, just before he was too far away.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and it doesn’t make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-offs
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated before the playoffs, there wasn’t much reason to force a new start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoffs. They currently face one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one wildcard for the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but are now looking to do everything they can to secure their first division title.
“While there’s nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play with it?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the pitching field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part. That's why I come up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “We’re seeing a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we’re seeing it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control, but we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “provide resistance and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and false and lying.”
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Committee on Justice, leading to loud bells from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, eh no, I'm waiting for one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a large church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MEPs who get to say that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically similar issues like these where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And so it was during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I was already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a “more earthly, softer” politics has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political outlook to me, suddenly expected me to make a change and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of a public, whatever I say, there are slanderous parties on social media calling for me to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election, exposing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's all I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing every day with a torrent of sexist or racist reactions, but do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that bad scams are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules the party becomes less mindful.
Over the past two years, I’ve often been advised to keep me cheerful, not just to proclaim my opinion loudly, and then I wouldn’t ‘get into trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics before that.
Since joining Labour as a schoolchild 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country drags on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a member of parliament for the next election or your political opportunities will not stop me from trading.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on his way to the top
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphing in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
Ultimately, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a tough time in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: “All the honors to Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors match), Melrose was able to speak out the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break off a try.
With a penalty, Climo secured an extra lead for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo try just before the rest. Thus, it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long overdue for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was discharged on a stretcher, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue through a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed on a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson caused a touchdown at the penalty line-out behind the upset Ayr maul.
Climo made the conversion, and did it again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the hospitality industry. Apparently, he's been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts himself along with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “blooming restaurant business” in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol in a hull-clad naval office in La Paz.
At public buildings waving an ocean blue flag.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Across Bolivia’s countryside, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give up to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the court’s ruling on the big screen, hoping that the court in The Hague will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of spicy talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year, much is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation has perhaps even worsened in the last four years.
“The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Zárate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has all the goodwill that Chile might have completely undermined, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other’s country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of differences, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the maritime issue as a political stool.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can be trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot be trusted.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it’s a “utopia” that the enduring sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will one day get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious when it says it would renounce an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headwear, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes completely, don’t look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were inconceivable from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a plump wide border, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gems, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were sewn close to the lips, resembling Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this daring fashion, you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-meter-wide rim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a striped beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that the bag featured.
The red-orange raffia bag, set with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather hinge, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other initiatives from across the community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, the careers they choose and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects by excellence within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can deduce that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest passing rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the French students and 63 percent of the Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as subject matter as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, in the future he will have a real advantage with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that stood out above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for children today.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
There is currently no denying that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the pre-season opening game.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and fewer than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of election rallyes
It’s the first of five planned Trump rallyes in the coming week, including stops in places that are close to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the nomination of the candidate he elects for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will likely be talking about the hearings for candidate supreme judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra charged now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November election get more energetic.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies in the coming week were meant to “stimulate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season is beginning,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of opportunities is a fully invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who has the best chance right now?
“They first had a six-point lead, and now that’s only four more, so we think it’s so little that luck is on our side right now,” Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a feared opponent from tee to green and he sets the example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well grew louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well that made match four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His pit with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but wonderful European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that didn’t play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari win, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short saturations with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede they could no longer overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you to catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at a glance.
The European team has played the best so far and has had a nice lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown Team USA is ready to start the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes on Saturday, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who was struggling, making them four points ahead of Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine back, was stronger than the misleading Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points during Sunday’s 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, are the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening games after a sensational weekend.
After scoring Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a brilliant move from time to time, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, outfitted for the morning’s four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world’s number one and three, with 2&1.
Still, it didn’t come off a clay roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans by three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult 2&1 match by the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It’s only happened twice before in Ryder Cup history that a team was able to catch a four-point lag at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk’s team has enough of a tie as they currently hold the trophy.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will “in no case” unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N.’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took further steps, it was noted that he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is urging 'denuclearization first' and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.”
Ri did not report plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the U.S. leader said earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party on this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a step.
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the U.S. mainland so after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there is still much to do and that sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and decisively continued until we have achieved the full, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Course on the Importance of Sufficient Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will ensure that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night while drinking plenty of caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s largest university often have no idea the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course, which, as far as he knows, is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I hearing this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which will be organized for the first time this year, will explain to students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we find that they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know what consequences the choice for cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of one-night stand pride still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deficiency causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, because he had taken classes with the professor last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to wake up. They also need to be aware of the damaging effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, causing you to struggle to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their run-out again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and defeated Steven Gerrard's weak squad 1-0 at Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first win during an out-match since defeating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team managed the defeat, barely Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, who continue to the top of the Premier Ladbro.ship
Menga scored seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is rising to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as frontier judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visitor squad.
Gerrard made eight changes in his squad, passing Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who was able to score a point for the Hearts last week. He would have been excited about the way his well-trained squad managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder could not finish it.
Keaghan Jacobs' captain Craig Halkett reached a deep free staircase, but his teammate Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it if they could get closer to the goal.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of a game, but referee Steven Thomson swept away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at the goal twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was previously a goalkeeper at the Ibrox, was able to easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's domestic shot.
The opening of Livingston in the 34th minute may or may not be in the prolongation of the general course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not up to Jacobs's deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball into the goal.
Gerrard caused a break with Coulibaly/Ryan Kent, which had almost immediate consequences when wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased his lead in the final phase of the match, but McGregor held up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Rangers striker Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty kick at the end of the game after an encounter with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom well can tell... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger Counter.
The geiger counter has since become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film featuring the at first glance unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘That’s a geyser counter. It’s used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: ‘It’s really pounding right now!’
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ and Kill Malignant Cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them in a lab
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
With the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can “see” the protein HER2, which is often present in all types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and “learn” these cells to address cancer cells has previously been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.

Kanye West was cast during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head that reads “Make America Great Again,” he fired a tyranny against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you sympathize with Trump now?
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the alleged assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tyranny of West was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stab West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been shot in the backstage for his hat.
“They kicked me backstage.
They said, "Don't get on stage with that hat."
They kicked me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, ‘Do you want to see how apathetic he looks?’ He said he would dress her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice bow calls and the castle members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by one attendee: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.'
West was also a guest as the last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU THANK YOU THOUGH THE MASSA.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just himself, and that’s wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports and expels an ideology that harms my community (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’).
He is free to do whatever he wants.
We too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, he says, “the creature that is formally known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name; he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the late music teacher Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then into The artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast police judge on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington pulls out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor draws out to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys when seeing such roles on the screen often think they need to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who is recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me personally at the moment: where has our masculinity gone wrong?" he said.
“What have we taught men when they grew up, which is how we are now confronted with this problem?”
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is born and what is taught?”
What is being taught on TV and on the street that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
That, I think, is one of the big questions of today: how do we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels to Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit plays in a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful consequence of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I've taken care of my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China says the number of Chinese people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the same period last year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
The Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medicine since 2003 as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member leaked data from Republican senators and draws out “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters opposes allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the allegations are spread by “extreme-right” whistleblowers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more nasty lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The data published would include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate judge.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained information from a Waters employee, de Hill said.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and a blatant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly came under criticism online, including by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“You can tell from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s response to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“Heavy, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are known,” she said, “and that they are held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - A Weak Spy Paradox with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that indeed applies to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films starring a slappy spy, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was revived with Johnny English in 2011.
Is this airy self-satiry about how badly we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with puffy eyes and flexible facial stretches manages at least to send everything in the hundred, even with his second comeback. You can already deduce from his name that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinema walkers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a hint of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) which always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter in his medieval armor and tapping the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson may well show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humour is rather faint and crazy enough, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do it well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s silly misfortune comes to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Great Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Britain known, to the great dismay of the agent in office, a sadly small role of Kevin Eldon.
That’s the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds her of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she needs to hire a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the staggering Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a chic setting, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are some fun jokes in the story, because the English spy lessons remind us of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic helper Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a tempestuous and jovial role that is below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of clumsy doll fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to an opulent French restaurant, they kick noise aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and tumultuous the scene, it reminds me of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British workers work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party would reportedly want corporate bosses to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
This allows employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea “fits” in the party’s economic agenda and plans to make the country’s balance tilt toward the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Union of Trade Unions, which finds a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment to the next, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's effort to make the balance in the economy more to the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy intention and is not considered by the party either."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "faceless drivers" and the "profitors" at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their shares, as a Labour government could apply ‘discounts’ based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds that give 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' Whether FBI Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast on 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they could discover something that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about this than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to stand firm.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival is being organized in New York, an annual music event that will feature a very impressive line-up of stars and has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concert attendees who wanted to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise generating meaningful awareness for the purpose.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of “clitivism,” making people feel like they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million “actions” of supporters have been registered, targeting a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to global leaders’ commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that need to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected through sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the UK with the aim of “helping children realize their full potential”. This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice that is malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent out asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey, in which we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will ultimately be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the navy for a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can resort to the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counteract this.
"The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that posts itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went further and compared Washington’s approach to Russia to Iran’s approach and noted that these do not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a 'craft', with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw sight of the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Berlin’s Trum, has made Moscow a “prisoner”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to take part in 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she was "seriously considering" taking part in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering taking part in the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren was running against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said he was “sending this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m up to the bone concerned about what Donald Trump brings to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this.”
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters feel she should not stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll by the Suffolk University’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of her being elected.
The survey showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Speaks About Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
“Through what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I understand for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience attending a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interfering in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support protest against new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a statement as a “friend of the court” last Friday in Washington’s court in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was then detained in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the U.S., as countries experiencing major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores state, federal and international law for decades.”
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an impediment is contrary to that principle," the court said in a statement.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. harms the U.S. economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and “provide the country with the necessary workforce.”
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those fleeing their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched in their wet possessions for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the possibility of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remnants of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' with 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, an allegation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever-higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” Branstad wrote in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is exercising freedom of expression and a free press, a long-held tradition in America by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in the center of Beijing, you will find in vain divergent voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article," if he did not say which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
Now that many prominent Republicans are rallying around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this topic have risen enormously and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue with the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he is wondering whether Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)’s attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute will be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow and they are not going to forget November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is Coming!” during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further clarified her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there could be a setback if the Republicans pushed through the nomination.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former Republican Party chairman, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh taking place in court, but it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats be elected, said in a statement.
However, the Americans appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing off on the side of the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony for sure or likely and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied for sure or probably during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s advance, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford swore to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid gives users the ability to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that ‘world domination’ is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can store contact lists, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not hold talks with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will completely overturn all of their business models at once."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and wearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only Church of England clergyman to have won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, so he never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918, across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field shots and machine guns".
He later stormed on to the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone to a field shooter and shutting down three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch a crowded Bellator 206 and you don’t get to see the most important moment.
The postcard from San Jose listed 13 fights, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake all night for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
“According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children can be displayed after 6:00 a.m., so we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Daddy's the pig," yessssss.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will adapt their programming to ensure viewers in the UK will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the rematch, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can’t discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all that friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did already, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel 'Inferior' to His Sexual Orientation
Olympic clean jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to further education that ‘not everyone is as I am.’
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that parenting had contributed to less value being given to winning during the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a shift on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than others during his youth because it was "socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone” so that he wouldn’t disappoint people if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a striking campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "completely surprised me."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much so young," he took part in his first Olympics at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already gotten the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the front row anymore, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I was finally able to recognize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly taken him on his way to the games and from which he still got chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is to be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must find his way back to make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is attending the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the five-majors winner divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it’s all about.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs roaming balls routinely punishes.
And if the run itself is not deterrent enough, Mickelson will face the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has proven to have confidence in this man, although honestly he could hardly have done otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back, slapped his arm around me and said he's ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more of it, but it's the way it is and it's the way we felt we had to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 tie games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain untouchable impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to make jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he said.
"I think the younger players liked to have him fooled occasionally last week, which was fun to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big advantages can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a less comfortable situation.
De Deen made his debut in the match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'll keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, calling off here after seeing the 2018 aerial win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well on a National Lepro.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to work hard tomorrow.
Go ahead and implement the plan in the right way.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s winning this trophy, and that’s what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players that we can have, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never precede things in this area.
Tomorrow there will be another challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements will come to the fore, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re alone, your golfing abilities are only really tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had cheered up his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches for the turn tomorrow, but let’s try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve tailored our line-up to this and we’re sending the men on the way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we’re going to try to make something out of the high hat tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and sets Rory McIlroy up for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the remaining Europeans in the first half of the squad.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship postponed
The newest German navy frigate was supposed to be deployed in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War warships, but it will take at least another year to be ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be part of the Navy in 2014, but the troubling problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class commissioned by the navy in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the continued delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit notes.
The fateful frigate F125 has already made headlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would render the warship useless if it were to be deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually had "a shortage of employable ships".
The official said the problem has grown over time like a snowball because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were yet available to be incorporated into the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats.
New research conducted on a estate in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown big eagle bat, and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's screams and what kind of what does.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation advisor, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, just like flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Butterflies are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much about bats is not yet known and therefore the work we are doing here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of controlling bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could result in the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially exterminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and many of our species simply don’t know how their populations are going.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of assault as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described allegations of assault as “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The head of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, called the reports “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the business.
I am a happy man, and through and through well," added the footballer, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called “an inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as read in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes left behind that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was “fearful of the consequences” and because she was concerned about the “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to have the scheme declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of going to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer left for Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will have eternal regrets' if automakers leave
The UK "will forever regret it" if it loses its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the UK's minister of economic affairs.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a “no-deal Brexit” would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers worry about risks in the supply chain in the event of a “no-deal Brexit”.
Toyota's production line runs on the "just-in-time" principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be unrest at the borders that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota could not store more than one day in stock at the plant in Derbyshire, the company said, and in that case production would be stopped.
Clark said May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly aligned to avoid those border controls".
“We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity,” he told the listeners of BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative for the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “another week” as the fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s influence on the election, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been running the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and dismiss the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, there were rumours that he was about to file his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate once again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet set for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attention-grabbing" TV journalists, though, she added, "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly questions, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that a lot in recent weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made an open-hearted and at times bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be made.
But at the same time, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we would like you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after sustaining head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and more or less collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tacked a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when they buy a home in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase in taxes is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when they buy a home in the UK and the extra proceeds are used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and tell this story on multi-earners.
The increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional proceeds being invested in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes in addition to current lees, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rent, could go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 per cent of new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually 'ghost cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in leeches to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the "housing scandal" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to eviction "without negligence".
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister restoring the ‘British Dream’, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be repaired.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for non-UK residents, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of owning a house has ever become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over its head is already too real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his "ultimate ambition" to ever become the manager of Scotland.
The Scots, 42, enjoy the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, which is currently in third place in League One, at three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and with that the stocking was off," Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I saw Scotland playing at Hampden Park with my father often and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that opportunity would only come if I was successful in managing a club.”
Ross's predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a major club, earlier he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by ‘can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League."
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross has only spent three years as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more at ease now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did quite well, I earned quite well and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be hard.
There are a lot of things you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I feel as good as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heatwave in the summer has raised revenues from British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenues rise by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consulting firm, which compiled the figures, said: “During sunshine and the fact that England took part in the World Championships longer than expected, July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were still having more.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that are focused on selling liquor performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants going down.
Pubs that are also focused on selling food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people only went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the turnover was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the nightlife market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a revenue decline of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come to a worse time for the operators focusing on food and only time will learn whether the more temperate temperatures of August can give the much-needed rest."
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, have a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Reveals Growth in 'False Insta Pages'
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11, create social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “false Insta accounts,” a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean ‘main account’ that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally landed on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager there who asked others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half agreed to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and on the field, and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help drive the sport in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comment on the BBC, could no longer run after a TIA.
He tweeted: “Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn whether I will recover and to what extent.
It’s been awfully hard work, but I’m now fully recovered, I’ve learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows shares online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what’s called “the quietest portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to pissing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't oysters, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies."
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has prompted an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say it embellishes the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to expect and give birth to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days after delivery."
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a nutritional bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else commented: “This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song "hilarous".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit weird, but I haven't been looking for too much.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who piss (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like 'cows'.
This ad is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who piss sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a nutritional bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on plunge.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing pitting mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the pitting and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and they are afraid of jeopardizing their own chance to stay in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We are prosecuting these people," Mr Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear in court within one month after the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the employees at the shelter.
Many of them will stand before the court via videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for aid will be deported soon.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey’s “occupying force” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even when the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign troops are illegally located on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been rooted out and driven from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terror groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and he accused "some Western countries of spreading irrational fears" leaving most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
“They are politicizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and said he hoped that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem clarified the Syrian government’s conditions for participating in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited “to review the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by a deposition procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of reviews for cable shows with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the head of the ABC drama ‘Designated Survivor’, said in a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can influence or determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond a well-informed citizen wanting to be The Daniels implicate, when you notice that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of resources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who are talking about Paul Manafort's jack of leather, Paul Manafort's full cost of $15,000.
I’ll never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's filling you with something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the Trump show's rotating role distribution and daily plot changes.
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you’re behind it.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and people saying ‘this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is seeing an influx of money, thanks to a re-arrangement of an electoral district that forces two sitting MPs to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified Pittsburg district meets Democratic MP Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must face another sitting MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th District.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional ("gerrymandering") in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a sharp victory in a well-regarded special election for the 18th Electoral District of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for support to China and have refrained from doing so
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners dismissed the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for controlling narcotics, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials said they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible punitive measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan now is for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further hesitation, without harsh messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible opposition to justice, for which heavy evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump will have to account for that institution, just as he prepares to address the voters again, and maybe he will have to account for himself to a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot of mess, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a "coup d'état" against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the inexorable advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are currently facing various of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that, last year, he had suggested recording conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table depicting a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien to visit on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but from the point of view of the whole game, a match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it’s going to be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match. But if the audience is behind us, I’m sure we can push through and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feelgood factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women Can't Sleep Because of Fear of Retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where we're going to start.
Talk to your spouse(s) and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes on time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you are going to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arms: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or investing your equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes when the insurance needs to be deployed.
Provide a proxy for health care so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can’t do it yourself anymore.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother encounters a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
In this case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Set these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"Which medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes up.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air-pressure rifle when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, forty plus, was in Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Due to the disconnection of the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The Regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis for the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice presidency, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence, and offering resistance during the arrest, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offence, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in detention at the Mat-Su detention facility with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he reportedly carried over to his time of service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the centre of Celebes, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Claim Rare Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing pedestrians and cyclists coming on his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Sajpov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intent demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation" according to the prosecutors and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as "terrible, cruel and corrupt".
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York demanded the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they had been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, she the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment with 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize a “people’s army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told participants at the Birmingham march that the UK would be “already out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling the heavily divided ranks is underlined by two pro-Remain conservatives attending a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on track as it is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she will continue and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw Chequers in the trash.
He suggested that Farage should be ridden and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the job, we'd be out now," Bone said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists going door-to-door and making sure we get elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message to May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the "heat" if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to set our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, on fire.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that brought us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this march with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved flags that featured Tories Against Brexit after the group’s founding over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the House of Commons for Labour, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can provide for IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Think Well’ About Presidency Candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “go to think well about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican deputy who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might enter the fight with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One attendee asked her if she would stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our flawed government and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest after shooting of Wayde Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested after the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died from the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has confessed to being present at the crime scene, possessing a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is being held in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98-meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory on team’s orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel entered the pit and let Hamilton drive in the crowd in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back to the top after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a long time, because he stayed with his tyre choice and aimed at a quick finish so he could catch Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth spot.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and let me through.
The team has done their best for places one and two," Hamilton said.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday over the fact that she maintained not to be the source of the leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he indicated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people could be "ugly, unkind and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they then say ‘oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn’t leak,” he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial, and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't good body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Further defending the Supreme Court candidate, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize back power, by all necessary means.
You see the wickedness, the rudeness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to ride over to seize power and regain control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals led by scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer put the Giants back in charge.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up a lag on Friday night to then defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made the Giants take their first break with a lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to a draw with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He secured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway through the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making hundreds of people flee the earthquake on a plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks are still plaguing the area and many have been buried beneath the dot in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was ready at the time on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News from Australia reported.
We had a helicopter arranged from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands, and told the country's disaster agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have devastated Palu, where a massive funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the soldiers present: "I call on all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
“Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says another man is missing after earlier reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane got underwater during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events is, remains unclear for the time being.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and a few others succeeded by wading the water that came to their minds to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby on a shipyard also helped with the rescue work by taking people to shore on an inflatable boat before the plane sank further into the approximately 30-metre-deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that in the last twenty years, 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of this relates to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his probation on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for a few hours as a witness-expert in the field of information analysis.
He clarified to the jury how he had used the cell phone call data to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis erased the texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense begins Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip-hop'?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argue that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and tackling social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make ‘conscious hip hop’ popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York-based babysitter challenges a couple in court over 'racist' text
A New York-based babysitter sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after receiving an erroneous text stating that the mother was complaining about "again such a black man."
The couple denies being racist and calls the trial “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
"Nope, it's so black again," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper The New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Mrs. Maurice resigned when she realized her mistake, stating that her previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done poor work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is challenging the couple in court to get compensation of $350 per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to intern with the family, although without a contract.
“I want them to feel like you’re just not doing something like that,” Maurice told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple bites off on the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, feared they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Don't fuck with me.'
Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That’s not so sympathetic,” added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to chapter the couple on social media, where they are blamed for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly appeared letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said of the letter: "It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She told that her father, who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman worked for the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt 'bitter sweet' after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said, her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like a child’s accomplishment; you’re proud when you’ve done nothing for it yourself.
I think he was pretty much experiencing Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for his success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad’s call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly became exhausted and left her body.
She had died some time before that and this process turned everything off further.
I could just sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I had to be really big.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
I sat down with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide make themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be silent, talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids unpacked their gifts, he didn't look at them at all."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that they have to deal with it: “It’s tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
We all need to keep fighting and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigation begins
"I thought that if we could indeed get what he asks for; an investigation limited in time and scope, then maybe we could create a little more unity again," said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart, in the midst of a tight patch inside.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to initiate an investigation?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are severely hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has the report ready?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Vice President Mike Pence the opportunity to cast the determining vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of overshooters 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the smugglers to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly evicts them.
North-South relations, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, focusing on the stagnated negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large part to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of the lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
"Without faith in the actions of the United States, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has named U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him “gross and coordinated character murder,” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she found Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to institute an impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he is not telling the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, which is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the review of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to stand up and cheer if a hysterical, biased person is appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It is a just tyranny of months and years of rampant anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method where she would cry whenever she got angry. To the one with whom she then spoke, she said: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partly permissible as an expression of anger, because crying becomes essentially misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories of a former job, in a male-dominated office, was when I had to cry terribly because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a cool business manager that everyone was a little scared of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called "Monkey Business" (informally meaning "cat madness" or "monkey areas") and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not run herself.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was advanced, she lagged behind with fundraising, and so she solemnly vowed not to join if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign anyway, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of deputies, and of rage over sexism – that she was in it.
"People will have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
“They will have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the U.S.-China trade war were daunting, and although the battle has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken retaliation in kind every time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equate each time with the US, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink quickly.
In order for Washington to bend, requests must be granted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays it smart, the trade war with the US, China could positively support in the longer term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could put either country into an economic free fall is actually much more dangerous than spectators have acknowledged before,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the National Center for a New American Security, a spokesperson for the Center for a New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in his country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An estimated six million people are still living in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a finish score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
U.S. team star Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling nearly the entire tournament, allowed his long stroke from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, admitting his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shone in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the European team’s lowest scorer, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top-ranked player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the singles game on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods, I followed that guy all the time as I grew up," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled over the weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. Commander Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve fought.
Shortly this morning we made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We are overwhelmed.”
