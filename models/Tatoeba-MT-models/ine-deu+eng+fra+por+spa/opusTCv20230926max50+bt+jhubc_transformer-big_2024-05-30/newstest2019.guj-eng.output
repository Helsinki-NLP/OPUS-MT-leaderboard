At the international level, the Chinese yuan is trying to create international currencies at the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
India and Russia are looking for ways to make this deal in rupees and rubles, in view of the possibility of a U.S. economic ban.
International Desk: India and Russia have reached an agreement on the S-400 Defense Missile System between the U.S.'s banning chemists today.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal has been approved by the U.S. government in a bid to take the U.S. dollar to pay for the deal between the two countries.
Sources claim that India and Russia are looking at the possibilities of making this deal in rupees and rubles, considering the possibility of an economic ban by the United States.
The U.S. was banned during the Chinese deal.
It is worth mentioning that in September, Russia made a S-400 missile deal with China.
In the aftermath of the deal, U.S. President Donald Trump decided to impose a ban on China.
Due to this ban, the purchase of the missile was almost impossible for China to use the US dollar.
However, over the past few years, China has attempted to raise its currency yuan in comparison to the dollar as the international seal of approval.
After this initiative, China is constantly trying at the international level to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, the yen and the pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve of the U.S. dollar in international trade, according to the report.
China wants to make the yuan an international seal of approval.
The five-billion-dollar mega-defense deal may be subject to a U.S. Coal Ban (countering U.S. Advertisement Thru Sections - CAATSA).
Last month, the United States imposed a ban on the purchase of S-400 missile systems in China.
Since then, India and Russia have started to set up an alternative arrangement for this deal.
Earlier, a US ban on the repair deal on the INS Chakra leased from Russia led to a $ 2 trillion deal between India and Russia, which was estimated to be worth $ 2 trillion.
The economic analyst claims that, in order to get out of such a situation, India should exercise the trade by using the rupee-ruble exchange as an international seal.
It should be noted that so far, all the defense deals that India has made with Russia have been made through the dollar.
Why was the U.S. Constitution passed?
In August, President Donald Trump approved the Katsa Act in view of Russia's state-of-the-art defense missile system. - The U.S. has approved the Katsa Act for the U.S. from the U.S. to the U.S. at the international level.
It should be noted that this law of the United States has been prepared in the light of the activities of Russia.
This includes attacking Ukraine on behalf of Russia in 2014 and seizing Crimea, joining the Syrian Civil War, and interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Then, suddenly, a thousand-year-old secret arrived.
Ajab-Gajb Desk: This is a story of a Turkish man who made a big discovery while repairing a house.
During the repair, when the wall of his basement collapsed, he collided with a secret door.
From here, he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered an ancient city that had been hidden within the land for thousands of years.
The photographs of the city show how around 20,000 people lived in this underground city along with the arrangement of all their belongings and food-drinking items.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident dates back to 1963, when a person from Turkey living in Cape Town searched for an underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed during the renovation of the house.
From here, an underground city named Derinyuku, was found at a height of 280 feet inside the land.
Its height was equal to the building of 18 floors.
This underground city was once the home of 20,000 people, including preparations for everything from rooms, kitchens, schools, churches, tombs, etc., including ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city from here.
There is a heavy gate here, which is designed to stop those who sneak into the underground city.
Each of its floors can be closed differently.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 CE during the Second World War in order to protect the people here in the wars and natural disasters between the Arabs and the Second World War.
It's become a tourist attraction:
Darinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other cities like this, but this is the largest underground city among them.
Only half of the city can be reached, but the place has been transformed into a popular tourist attraction in Cape Town, the capital of the country.
Because of its historical and cultural importance, people come to see it here.

If the dead language of Israel can be revived by the Hebrews, Sanskrit is still a living language.
