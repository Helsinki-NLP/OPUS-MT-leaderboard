Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned about the possibility of "being perceived as sleeves"
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that this may make them an object of mockery.
One of the Labour Party's AM explained that their group is concerned about "sounds with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "one-way", while "pwp" means "kaka".
The party's Plaid AM indicated that none of the group was "unhappy" and has recommended alternatives.
A representative of the Conservative Party of Wales acknowledged that their group is ready to consider the change of name, but added that the MWP is very similar to Muppet, which means "sleeper".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly in the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting bills to change the name, informed: "The final decision on which terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be made by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Welsh Government (Government of Wales) Act of 2017 granted the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation of the proposal, which gained broad support for the change of the Assembly’s name to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the name AM, the Commission preferred "Welsh Parliament Member" (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
The AM clearly recommends alternatives, but the fight for the deal may cause headaches to Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the change in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the laws on disqualification of MPs and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on what they will be called will take place when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to resolve decades-long disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour creates an impression of claims to its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, one of the opponents of the name change plebiscite, said he ignored the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, object that changing the name is simply a matter of course to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent as the churches of Harlem struggle for existence.
"As the old people with whom I have spoken tell us, there used to be bars and temples on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even of worship, he is concerned that the money received from the sale of property will end sooner than the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point".
The temples, he added, may be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with condominium properties, where people who will not help the remaining shrines in the vicinity will mitigate.
"The majority of people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and as a result, the day will come when these temples will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who will enter these apartments properties will become members of these congregations."
Both were erected by the White Church, even before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist church abandoned the buildings in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshipped God nearby.
The Black Church of St. Martin took over his blessings during the reign of John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who had refused to hire blacks or give them a crop.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a bell game.
His blessing David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played this bell game in July used other words: "the treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng (Tiffany Ng) from the University of Michigan added that it was the first bell game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merivezer (Merriweather) said that the parish of St. Martin did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s Diocese reflected the intertwined relations between architects and builders, some of whom had been attracted to the work by the secular power, and others by the diocese of the episcopal church.
The parish council, made up of secular leaders, addressed the diocese in writing in July with concern that the diocese would "try to pass the costs" on to the council, although the council was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors dispatched by the diocese.
Some members of the church complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese’s activities.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager at lobster fishing site
Shark on Saturday in California attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters and hurt him. It was the first day of the lobsters season, the story services.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and then with the group rushed to him to help the boy pull out of the water.
Hammels explained that at first he had thought it was just an excitement about the caught lobster, but then he "understood that the boy shouts "Tell me!
I'm telling you!"
All of his key bone was torn apart," said Hammels, who immediately noticed it when he had reached the boy.
"I'm yelling for everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammels.
The boy was taken by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of attack shark is not known.
Rescue captain Larry Giles reported in brief media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks before, but it was recognized that it was not a human-hazardous species.
Jails added that the victim was injured in the upper torso.
For the purposes of investigation and security, officials closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's city of Encinitas.
Jyls noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry market
Sainsbury's goes on the attack on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with multi-store style beauty products shelves and trained salesmen.
As part of the UK’s significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion investment in the large beauty market, which continues to grow despite the decline in sales of fashion goods and home-made items, 11 stores in the country will try out more beauty products per year in more queues in the queue of beauty products, and if all roll
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use shelves that were previously dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty offerings for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded zones similar to those in, for example, Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-launches its "Boutique" line of decorative cosmetics, in which most products will be vegan-friendly — which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers in years.
In addition, fragrance wholesaler Fragrance Shop will try the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to small groceries in local stores every day means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that grocery stores will become more and more like supermarkets as the chain tries to fight with discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos stores in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats stores since buying both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved the flow of goods and made the purchased more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tried in the early 2000s, but the union collapsed after a dispute over how to distribute income from pharmacy grocery stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy evolves after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Under this plan, the task of Lloyds will be to complement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "To improve the customer-centric environment, we've transformed the look and feel of our beauty products' shelves.
We have also invested funds in highly trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now an enchanting goal on the path to beauty, a goal that challenges previous shopping habits."
Peter Johns 'full of brilliance' after Holly Willoughby quits 11 million pound deal
"Dragon's Dan" star Peter Jones "takes on the rage" after TV host Holly Willoughby renounced an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle brand in order to draw all the attention" to "Spence" with his new "Marc"
Viloubiy does not have time to dedicate their home costume and accessories to the brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to the brand "Goop" by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, a 37-year-old broadcaster, used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of "Dragons Dan" Peter Jones in a rage as he left his lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute — to focus on his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was "full of excitement" when the TV golden girl tightened during the meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts with no sign of a timing of up to 1.5 million mares
The company was compared to the Guinea Plateau brand "Goop", and, according to the hint, it will double Vilovia's wealth, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones took her away from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
As the source says: ""Truly" was the main of Holly's priorities.
This was to become her long-term future, to which she would dedicate the next decade.
Her decision to leave surprised all the unprepared involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
In the center of Marlow there is a warehouse full of finished goods for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the managers of This Morning, which is one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay the company millions, because a lot of money has been invested in a variety of products — from pillows and candles to clothes and goods for the home, and even more will delay their marketing.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children's mother Willowbie and her husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby "Truly" co-founded with Kep in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones as chairman joined in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in the firm of Baldwin TV producers.
Willoughby has to become a brand ambassador for M&S, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business deals!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from news companies about a comment that some may find "unfit for the president" and about the way he treats the North Korean leader so positively.
Why is the President resigning so much?
Trump said in his portrayed voice of a "message dictator."
"I'm not giving up on anyone!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump acknowledged his initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearisation.
However, the talks on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho), informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "response" from the US to North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the cessation of missile testing, the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to make a presidential impression, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this densely populated area, we have 200, here, here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia landed on an island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs, for example, were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so that is a certain problem," admitted Ms Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is collecting a group for a trip to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be able to contribute to the relief.
Given that earthquakes occur on a regular basis in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for natural lightning.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been established in Aceh, they are rarely found along other shores.
The deaths were also likely due to the fact that Palu was not sounded by the tsunami warning sirens, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new post-mortem victims.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia’s ruined infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration and he is expected to be re-elected next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to deal with the long-standing problem posed by tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: "Liverpool" player Daniel Starridge with ambition restores balance in the match against "Chelsea"
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starring received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, being about 25 meters (30 yards) from Chelsea's goal, when his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then pulled the ball in the direction of the farthest goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) in the jump and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to get myself as much time as possible," Starrige explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touching the ball, and, not thinking much, throwing."
In the second half, Chelsea was led by 1:0 after the Belgian star Eden Hazard took the lead in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker took the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before turning to the middle of the field and moving as fast as possible to the side of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> quickly played and received the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful punch between the players, allowing Azardam to get into the zone.
Azards overtook the defense in speed and completed the combination by striking his left leg in the further pole net, passing Liverpool's Elison Becker.
"Liverpool" Champions League Group stage on Wednesday, at 15:00 "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will fight with "Napoli".
Chelsea and Videoton will meet in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reaches 832 people
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the state disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people have been trapped in the debris of buildings after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high waves, news conference spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho (Sutopo Purwo Nugroho) reported.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered by debris from collapsed buildings.

The murder investigation was launched after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old victim with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called for people in the area who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan reported: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite anyone who was in the vicinity of John's Street in Birkenhead to contact us and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also invite anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something on their car's video recorder, to contact us, as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing and, according to police, they are informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He couldn’t say a word when he found out what had happened.
People are informed that it will take hours for them to be allowed to return.
I was listening to a policeman tell a man that the whole neighborhood is perceived as a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible!".

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the latest scandal of "rewriting the story"
Abandonment would be ethically justified given the Taliban-like activities that led to his fanatical Puritan followers destroying so many monuments of English culture and religion.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure would also become a target outside Westminster Castle.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out the destruction of statues during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed to his predecessor, Thomas, who lived centuries earlier.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell reflects an opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a person who, as many believe, is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith reported to the Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells - probably at the end of the 19th century it was more than it is today - considered a parliamentary defender against external pressure, which in his case, of course, was a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue as to whether this is really a perfectly accurate representation of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable figure who represents one of the sides of the division at the time.
What she has accomplished as the protector of the Lord is worthy of praise and commendation."
Pig-murder to death cracks farmer in China
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed on a pig market in southwest China.
A man named Yuan was found dead with a grafted artery, all in one blood at a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pigtails are about to inject vaccines into pigs on 30 May 2005 in a swine herd in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is reported that he and his nephew had arrived Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his nephew found the man dead and discovered that the door to the nearby pig shed was open.
He told us that there was a big pig in the pig shop with blood on its mouth.
According to information, a forensic medical investigation confirmed that a 550 pound (<0x7E>249 kg) heavy wedge had torn the farmer.
"My nephew's legs were bloody and mutilated," said the nephew — is mentioned only his last name Vu (Wu), writes "Guiyang Evening News".
The footage from the security camera showed Juan coming to the market around 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan did not belong to him or his nephew.
The market manager informed Evening News that the whistle was turned on to prevent its attacks on others as police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to information, Juan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other porcine attacks in humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, as a result of which the man sustained critical injuries.
Even 10 years ago, a 650 pound (<0x7E>295 kg) heavy pig in Wales kept a farmer forced to a tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After farmers in Oregon were feeding their pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to sneak in, they are very curious ... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of Hurricane Rosa will bring a broad and powerful thing to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves across the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flood-causing rain gases to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At five o'clock in the afternoon (after North American Eastern Time), the pink winds reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was located 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure inlet is forming above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards towards the U.S. East Coast. Pink with tropical storm forces approaching the Lower California Peninsula, on Monday it will begin to move deep into the north from the tropics.
In the pink part of Monday, Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low-pressure debris, will create a large strong rainfall zone in the Southwest in the coming days.
1–4 inches (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mudslides and possibly landslides in the desert.
Humidity deep in the tropics will cause rain gases to reach 2–3 inches (<0x7E>5.1–7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona, expect up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm) of rain.
Sudden flooding is possible with a rapid deterioration of the condition due to the dispersion of tropical rain gases.
It is very unwelcome to walk in the desert due to the threat of tropical rain gases.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but storms will bring local strong winds and sandstorms.
The low-pressure inlet will bring local strong things to the South California coastline as it approaches.
Rain gases that together will exceed half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm) are possible, and this can cause small mudflows and slippery roads.
It will be the first rain gas in the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain gases in Arizona will begin to approach late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains take over wider territory late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain on Tuesday will spread to the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Jutta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S., as temperatures in the Arctic are decreasing, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in a short distance.
This is a dramatic example of temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Old Town and Demoine (Des Moines), Iowa, differs by almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, a prolonged summer heat will try to form and spread.
In most parts of the central and eastern US, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit and above (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) in vast areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (after Farenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest that temperatures in the eastern part of the United States are highly likely to exceed the average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the case of Brett Caveno
More than 20 million people watched six TV channels on Thursday with enthusiasm, as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment in the late 20th century as a woman, said in a statement.
In the meantime, the political uncertainty continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasting to report on the latest developments in Friday's events: an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Caveno was intoxicated and tried to take off his clothes during a high school party.
Caveno relentlessly testified that he was fully convinced that this did not happen.
According to the Nielsen report on Friday, it was watched by 20.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, "Fox News Channel" and MSNBC recorded average viewer interest.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually encounters problems when counting the people who are watching what is going on in the office.
To get a better idea, this number of spectators corresponds to the number of exclusion games or "Oscar" ceremony spectators.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Caveno, had the highest number of viewers, with an average of 5.69 million during the entire day of the hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC — 2.89 million, and CNN — 2.52 million, reported Nielsen.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleek was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican team had published a statement that he was voting for Cavendish’s appointment, the senator was spotted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he, accompanied by a shout of protesters’ anger, attempted to take the elevator to the Justice Committee’s hearing.
On CNN live, he stood for several minutes with his eyes pounded as if down.
"I'm standing here, right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you own power as long as so many women are powerless."
Fleek explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he was informed that he had more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected what was happening several hours later when the Committee on Justice was about to vote on the nomination of Caveno for a vote in the Senate.
But Fleek said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would look into the accusations made against the candidates next week, which have been demanded by a minority of Democrats.
He was partly convinced by talks with his fellow Democrat senator Chris Coons.
After negotiating with Koons and several other senators, Fleek made his decision.
Fleick's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Britain’s Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit-related political games
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of "political games" about Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with her newspaper front page, May's former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexit plan on Britain's future relationship with the European Union, the so-called (Chequers plan), emphasizing that the EU's "abstract, suggestion and suggestion is one of the
Sims Shooting: Police have arrested Diteon Simpson, who is suspected of murdering a LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police station reported.
Officials released a video showing Sims' collision with Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police informed him that he had confessed to the Way shooting.
According to his lawyer, he was given $350,000 in security.
A team of forensic experts from East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary conclusion on Friday that the death was caused by a gunshot to the head that hit the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Task Force, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that resulted in the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcers for their "discipline and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot 6-inch (<0x7E>1.98 m) long striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" over the death of Type.
"That's what a man always worries about," said Way.
Volcano spills ashes over Mexico
The ashes rising from the Pocatepetla volcano have reached the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The Centre observed repeated tingling and trembling.
Images on social networks showed that the windshields of cars in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Hochimilco (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the activation of the volcano in the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash between pro-independence protesters and law enforcement and when thousands joined opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of disguised sectarians, who were hampered by the public policy police, beat them with eggs and poured powdery paint, forming dark dust clouds on the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements also emerged later that day, and the police used steaks to prevent quarrels.
For several hours, groups of independence supporters, chanting "Don't forget and don't forgive!", were involved in the confrontation of unity-supporting protesters who chanted: "Long live Spain!"
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were provided with medical care for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal in Madrid but which was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains very tense.
Voters strongly supported independence, although voter turnout was low, and those who were against segregation mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, and violent clashes broke out.
Independence support groups had been deployed on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termez, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expects Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes fill with tears of joy because they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
While the parties supporting Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant lead, these parties have struggled to keep up the pace this year, as several of the most famous leaders have either immigrated to the country in the war, or have been detained and imprisoned.
A 42-year-old mechanic named Joan Puig, who filmed a phone call in support of police, said the conflict had been set on fire by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger and bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in detention since last year until trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy for the European elections is the best way to expose the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after entering a building by car
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after the car was repeatedly crashed into a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings reported that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that the machine was fired at the same time from the arbalète.
This is the first time you’ve ever seen a person in a relationship.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
Supported Livingston stunned the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games in the role of Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Meng's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team leveled the situation with the Hibernian.
Gerard's team has not won in this championship season, and next Sunday they have to meet with the leader "Hearts", of which they are behind by eight points.
Before that, in the European League on Thursday "Rangers" hosted Vienna "Rapid".
In the meantime, Livingston extended its lossless series to six games in the division, and head coach Holt still hasn't tasted defeat since he replaced Kenya Miller last month.
"Livingston does not take advantage of the opportunity against dull guests
Holt's team with their direct game, which in a variety of ways burdened the Rangers, had to be in the lead long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping on his feet to prevent Craig Halkett from beating his head across the goal line was unsuccessful.
The hosts allowed "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And that's exactly how the crucial gate came.
"Rangers" allowed the freeway, and "Livingston" used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinsons merged to provide an opportunity for Meng, who beat and got the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had Kelly save the goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was interrupted by the agility of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov missed the goal in the Livingston combination.
In the Livingston area, centralized balls continued to appear, but two calls for punishment — after Halkett’s fight for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for playing with his hand — were rejected.
"Fenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont (Alasdair Lamont) in the arena "Tony Macaroni"
A phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to exceed expectations, constantly improving performance.
Their style of play and personality have practically not changed since returning to the highest level, but Holt deserves great praise for how he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at maintaining first-class organized defense, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were always alert.
But the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
No matter how good they sometimes were under Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they broke into the part of the hosts' square — and this is basically an invitation to wake up the "Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
What is the best way to do this?
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue skies.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
The police, for security reasons, blocked a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also expressed their attitude, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him.
The mutual protests by the two sides reflect the contradictions created by a guest, part of whom is considered a hero by the Germans, while others despise him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the highway section of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the help was provided by the doctors, but the man died at the scene of the incident.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Sunday, when the driver left the crash site.
The capital’s police service said the police were involved in identifying the man and informing their relatives.
Roads and buses are closed at the site of the event, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six workers injured during riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison workers were injured in riots in a men's prison.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent the riots involving eight prisoners, which are confined to one wing, staff of the special service "Tornado" were involved
Workers were treated for mild facial injuries at the site of the event.
A representative of the prison service said: "Specially trained prison personnel were involved in resolving the incident in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were provided with medical care for injuries.
We will not tolerate the violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was being treated in the hospital after the prisoner’s attack.
And last October, the personnel responsible for dumping control were sent to prison to resolve the serious unrest in which the staff had been attacked with billiard bombs.
Hurricane Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with sudden flooding (possibly drought-affected areas will benefit from the situation)
Arizona suffers from a tropical depression rarely, but this is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rosa with the remaining force moves across the deserted southwest, creating a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a sudden flood warning on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Southeastern California and Southeastern Utah, including Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and Phoenix.
It is expected that Rosa will move directly past the Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the matter late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of the Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile (320 km) radius of the Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2–4 inches (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) of rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in individual locations.
Other desert areas of the south-west, including the central part of the Clinch Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely get 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54–5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not exposed to the risk of sudden floods, the Rose rain can become a blessing, because the region has been plagued by drought.
While the possibility of flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to come in handy as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa Road leads to the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Pink still with hurricane force on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore sinks.
Therefore, it is expected that the hurricane with the force of a tropical storm will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the part of the raingas Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"It is expected that the rainfall will reach 3-6 inches (7.62-15.24 cm) from Lower California in the southwestern part of Sonora, with precipitation possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rose will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then move across Arizona and reach the south of the state on Tuesday late in the evening.
"The main threat expected from Rose or its debris is very strong rain gases in Lower California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that this rain will cause life-threatening sudden floods and mudslides in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m. BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
Police reported that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested at night in the Redstock area, in Eivonne and Somerset.
The police have called for the recall of anyone who may have mobile phone material about what happened.
Trump claims Caveno has suffered from the Democratic Party's "evil and anger"
"The vote on Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics," Trump announced at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Caveno has suffered from the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Caveno testified before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the course of the hearing on his accusations.
The President announced on Saturday that the "people of America saw" Caveno's "excellence, abilities and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Caveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history of service to the people," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Caveno mentioned the nomination around, talking about the importance of Republican activity in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I was not a candidate, but in fact I was a candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have undertaken a mission to "protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important votes in the Senate on the nomination of Cavendish will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior assistant to the Republican leadership.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials on Saturday reported that at least 384 people were killed, many simply rinsed, when gigantic waves hit the shores after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
On Friday at the festival in Palu, hundreds of people had gathered for a holiday on the beach when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) hit the shore in a chair, rinsing many to death and destroying everything that was on their way.
Tsunami emerged after a 7.5-ball earthquake.
"When the threat of a tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still operating on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indian disaster mitigation agency, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, bales and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami, before hitting the shore, had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people climbed trees to escape, and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos of the disaster agency’s flight show many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a water-occupied mosque.
After midnight, the coastal towns continued to shake on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times that of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay possibly increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho's damage was described as "widespread" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels have collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
"Communications" were "completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongal," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going to the disaster-affected regions.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization reported.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
A video circulating on social networks shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting to people on the street at the bottom that a tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, rinsing buildings and machines.
The news agency "Reuters" was not able to immediately confirm whether the material is real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which shut down communication Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still had a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
This is very bad.
Mr Doseb (Doseba) said that World Vision workers, who had successfully reached Palu city from Donggal and now resided in a broom shelter in the office yard, had passed through scenes of damage along the way.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that had been demolished," he explained.
This is very bad.
Even when relief teams have decided to organise relief for the victims of the disaster, some have complained that foreign relief workers with extensive experience have not been allowed to go to Palu.
Under Indonesian legislation, the funding, resources and personnel of overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the damaged territory is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government declares, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been determined."
When Palu arrived on the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the still undetected people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that brighten the gloomy life during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliders team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners in the hotel "Roa Roa", including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am taught the burden of emotion."
Mr. Gendona recalled that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paragliders team, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages for hours to the participants of the Palu competition who took part in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one gray mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves rob $26,750 during ATM filling in Newport on the Levee complex
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning, who filled the ATM in the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the manager was busy, another man "took the Brink's employee from behind" and stole a bag of cash at the ATM.
According to the press release, the witnesses noticed several suspects leaving the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: the rapper changes his name to Je
The rapper Kanje Vest changes his name to Ye (Je).
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A person who is previously known as Kanji Vestu."
The 41-year-old Vest has been called Je for some time, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance in the show "Saturday Night Live", in which he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show tell us that he replaces singer Ariana Grandi in the show, who stopped the work for "emotional causes".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
In the beginning was Kanye, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thinking about the good and the bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more about who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, who had previously been known as both Puff Daddy and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesti, has also, and has not, used a thought mark and capital letters.
The President-elect of Mexico vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the retribution of students is approaching.
On Saturday, Tlatelolco Plaza promised "never to use an army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, an army unit overthrew a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans in their years by awarding grants to students every month and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are bringing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in the field, explains investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, launched its plan last year: to become a major country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Double-budget artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and the next cardinal shift in artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next achievement in artificial intelligence will happen in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order") was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of "Sinovation Ventures" who has invested the most in the company.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University (Carnegie-Melon), he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that outperformed America’s best Othello (Reversi) players, but later he was a leading employee of Microsoft Research and the president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government-organized technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be prepared with the idea of being able to identify people."
"Scientists in the US often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee says.
"It's not China that attracts leading scientists, it's big companies," he explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired faculty to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China published its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
Lee explained that the Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a single joint artificial intelligence center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (Central Research and Development Organization of the U.S. Department of Defense) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, the US legislation to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" by taking a step to resolve decades-long disputes with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbor’s name indicates claims to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist that the changes would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott has raised concerns that voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognized as valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, object that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organization such as the EU and NATO member.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely, under the guise of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MEPs have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
You will need a 2/3 majority in Parliament to change the name.
The National Election Commission informed that no violations were reported by one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, his wife Zorica and their son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardakov) prepared a small stage and arranged the chairs at the tents laid by those who boycotted the referendums.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to intervene with our heads raised, not through the slave door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev claims that NATO membership will begin the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "yes" result "will confirm our future".
The Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research poll published last Monday showed that 30-43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum — less than the required activity.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of voters plan to take part in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, voter activity must be 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government, which came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) passes through the entire Brighton defense to get the goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton by allowing Manchester City to win 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal win in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the combination.
He ran between the three Brighton guards, and threw himself into the free field.
Then Agvero took four green shirts.
He hit the ball for one defender, then beat several more on the edge of Brighton Square in the race.
Then he made a pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English centre striker used his first touch to play back Agvero, who put on the right football boot to beat Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
"We talked to him about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.
But it was Sterlings who provided Sky Blues with the initial advantage in Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Agvero received the ball deep in the territory of "Brighton".
He sent the ball with a beautiful punch along Leroy Sane’s left leg.
Sana'a was beaten several times until Sterling was entrusted with delivering the ball to the next goalpost.
The attacker of the center of "Sky Blues" easily hit the ball in the net just before crossing the border.
"City" will compete with "Hoffenheim" in the Champions League group games on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. Tuesday at the "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to provide problems "Rockies"
As the Nationals did not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart.
But Scherzer (Scherzer), who is always ready to compete, hopes to use Sunday's opportunity against the Colorado "Rockies", but only if the "Rockies" will have current exclusion games. And the "Rockies" in the National League Western team is led by a single game against the Los Angeles "Dodgers".
The Rockies have squeezed out at least a white card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but have not yet won their first title in the division.
“While we play the same way, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most outrageous I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but they are ready to let Shercer take the pitch.
Shercer, for whom it will be the beginning of the 34th, held a throwing session on Thursday in the part of the outdoor "bullpen", and on Sunday will throw the ball during the normal rest time.
The Washington labroci is 18<0xE2><0x88><0x92>7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The President cited the situation in which his elected Supreme Court candidate, Brett Caveno, has entered, while at the same time talking about the importance of Republican voter activity in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done in November is at risk.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It’s really very, very serious — I didn’t run, but I did run, and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrific, horrific group of radical Democrats acting right now.
And they are committed to regaining power using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, good deeds.
They don't care what they hurt, what they have to violate to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have undertaken a mission "to protest and resist".
"And you've seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling Democrats "wrong, evil, random and untrue."
On behalf of the Senate Committee on Justice, he named Senators of the Democratic Party, Diana Feinstein, to whom the audience responded with loud cries.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerable to the open
It was no wonder that the Momentum activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
After all, I am so far the last member of the Labour Party’s parliament to be informed that he is not desirable, all because we do not hide our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joanna Ryan, was in a similar situation because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economically responsible policies, national security, Europe – ironically, but these were issues in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The statement on the Labour meeting in East Nottingham on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MPs were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and the promises of a "welcome, gentler" policy have long been forgotten, if any.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different opinions, and any opinion is judged depending on whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the EU leader: colleagues, whom I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept views that I would never have agreed to in other cases, regardless of whether or not we were talking about it.
When I speak publicly — and it really doesn’t matter what I say — I follow a sign about using social media, calling for a ban on candidates in the next election, disguising the centre’s politics, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face daily streams of sexist and racist insults, but never try to avoid subjects.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should dig up a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of opinion and with every expression of mistrust or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised not to lie on the floor, think about what I am talking about, and then with me "it will be all right".
But that’s not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, in response to the negligence of the Techer government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I have set myself the task of fighting for better public services for those who are in need of such a government, the local government, and the local government.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the previous election.
No one in East Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and on areas in which I disagreed with the current government.
To those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is moving resolutely towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But basically, the only thing I want to announce is that I am not referring to Nottingham's Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are Labour members: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of denial of nominations or reminders that no one in politics is going to hold me back.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unnamed "Ayr" reaches the top row in the table
The last two attempts may have to some extent ruined the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unnamed team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent protection and the much better use of the opportunities that drove the hosts, and the coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tested all our games and we're still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "Congratulations to Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did."
The attempt by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, made by Frazier Climo, raised the "Ayr", but the yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where the game was awarded by the Warriors, changed the number of "Bearsons" and "Melgottsons".
The climate increased the management of Ayr with a penalty, right at the end of half-time, he scored points, then realized a solo attempt, thus "Ayr" took a break by 17-5.
However, Melrose's half-time started with a good game, and the attempt by Begott, by Patrick Anderson, reduced the backwardness to 5 points.
Then there was a prolonged pause, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was carried on a sledgehammer away from the field, but when the game resumed "Ayr" quickly moved forward, when Stafford McDowall made an attempt.
Ayr's current captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and once again, after intense pressure, Melrose used a redundant player — with Bruce Colvin's attempt that was not realized.
However, the hosts got together, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for taking Climax without a ball from the penalty corridor, MacFarson performed a touchdown "Ayr" at the back of the pier.
Clima has been playing the ball, as before, almost from the very beginning, after Kyle Rowe took over David Armstrong's field sprint and sent the flank player Gregor Henry to the hosts for the fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The comedy series "Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to plan to engage in the hospitality business, as it turned out that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he produces and participates with his old partner in comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and Kiernan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kiernan planned to engage in Glasgow's "blooming restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia imprisoned on land hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the Fleet Staff page, dressed in cords.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the memories of Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century over the lost coastline of resources are still alive, as are the longings to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are likely to be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and of course, with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile's duty is to discuss the sovereign exit of Bolivia.
Bolivian charismatic President Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in favour of Bolivia is implausible and, if adopted, no major change is expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate Chile and its representatives have stated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is passed six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", explained international regulatory expert Paz Zarate (Paz Zárate) from Chile.
And the last four years of the Bolivian case have not moved forward, but, on the contrary, delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric in Chile has silenced the rest of the good will, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once again continue the talks, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, did not agree that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of conflict, which will benefit both sides," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the problems of the sea as a political snare.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to understand what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only if it can be trusted by the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to eliminate their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Her comments came at a time when it seems that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is ready to resume impasse diplomatic measures to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chenu.
Ri says it's "fantasy" to hope that the U.S. still unrevoked sanctions and refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will ever make North Korea stand in the way.
Washington is cautious about accepting the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up arming, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for Kim’s next meeting with Trump.
The Paris fashion show introduces the latest massive headscarf line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne introduced the viewers to a row of absurd, huge headwear items in the Spring/Summer 2019 collection, which gleamed against the backdrop of the style set for Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to fashion shows.
Valentine's most outstanding feature was a gorgeous beige hat decorated with plumage-like wide edges on the apricot heads.
Among the massive accessories were jeweled watermelon, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips, and they were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than to high fashion.
One of the formations resembled a breathing dive, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the right time has come.
Style observers believe that huge dawns may be on your way to the nearest High Street.
Large-sized hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two-foot (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn them all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Very impractical hats as a cult item in all social networks led to another big deal on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model that carried it.
The red-yellow raffia bag, decorated with raffia berries and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" Spring/Summer 2019 collection of the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in the central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult for the mill to ignore the demand on demand."
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have an excellent reputation as educational institutions, and it has retained it in 2018 when, for the second time, excellent exam results were obtained, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art in music and other social events.
With a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the aim is to ensure the best possible level for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their lives as world citizens.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programs, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in the language he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak in his native language, it remains in his heart."
This is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the largest number of passing exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest mark A.
Data from the Scottish Independent Schools Council for 74 schools shows that 72 percent of students achieved the highest mark in Chinese A, and the same mark was also achieved by 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French and 63 percent who learned Welsh.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an optional subject, are now valued in independent school programmes as highly as subjects of the science-technology-engineering-mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) group.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for failing to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
Increasing work opportunities that will require language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, by learning a foreign language, they will in the future gain a real advantage from such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of multilingual speakers.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, while French was the only one spoken by a two-digit figure, 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially language proficiency in developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will learn languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important for the UK's future, according to plans by 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the relevant field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At the moment, in the global business environment, there is no denying that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans have finally waited for the moment when LeBron's first game in the Los Angeles Lakers will take place.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a Sunday pre-season opening game against Denver's Nuggets San Diego.
However, it remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Voltons reported on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell (Mike Trudell) tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Continuing the practice started this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season games series.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-sales games to prepare,” he said.
The time of the Trump myth in West Virginia is happening, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallying events today in Wilmington, West Virginia.
This is the first of five trampoline plans for next week, including stops in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his choice to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump’s goal is to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after voting in November.
When will the Trump rally in West Virginia take place today and how can it be watched online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at seven o’clock in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is expected to speak on this week's hearing in the case of Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno, who has been convicted of sex crimes, and a Senate vote is expected to postpone approval for a week until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this rally is to help improve the situation for Republicans who are expected to vote in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign shows that this week's five-meeting task is to "activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible because we are launching an active campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who refused to reveal his name, told Reuters.
This evening's rally, which is scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia senator Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president needs to come to help improve his poll results," University of West Virginia political science professor Simon Haeder told Reuters.
Raider's Cup 2018: The US has demonstrated a commitment to fight to keep high hopes for Sunday's singles
After three sessions "in a word" Wednesday afternoon game in the format of "foursome" was probably exactly what was needed for this Raiders Cup.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and really believe in it, especially in such competitions as these.
So on which side do they think success is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, because I think that in a way means that luck has turned to us," Jordan Spieth said as he went on his run.
Europe, of course, has a preference, as it is led by 4 points, but another 12 will be played.
Spitt explained that the Americans believe the wind blows in their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast of three points out of four.
Spit has been destructive from the spot of the first blow to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
Those gutural cries of victory became louder and louder as his round continued, a decisive beat was made in the pit to reach the same number of beats four times, when he and Thomas were behind by two beats after two.
His beating in the pit, which achieved his victory in 15 , was perceived by a similar cry, of them, for his conviction that the American team had not yet been expelled.
"You really have to dig deep, and you have to worry about your game," Spitty said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to get lucky.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple lags behind by four points and will not be able to harm.
Molywood was the only couple to survive on Saturday afternoon without a god, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine last holes on Friday morning.
This trend and the way their energy flows into this insane crowd and back convinces them that they are the players to win on Sunday, and Flintwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can provide a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talk of a European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson (Bubba Watson) and Webb Simpson (Webb Simpson) were quick to cope with this morning's hero in the format of "fourballs" Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played alongside Alex Noren (Alex Noren).
Bogie and the two doubles in the front nine led the Spaniards and the Swedes into a mess, and they weren’t even close to getting out of it.
But there is no one on Sunday that will help you get through it.
Games in "fourball" and "foursome" formats are so exciting to watch nearby due to the interaction of pairs, watching what advice they give and what they don't, and how the strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and before the last day is in the far lead, but this race in the format of "foursome" showed that the US team is determined to fight, which many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
European Selection Raiders Cup last day is in the lead 10-6
The European Selection Raiders Cup final day will begin in pleasant lead after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" race ended in lead with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two wins over hard-working Tiger Woods, which increased Le Golf National's score to four.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn to keep the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated the inaccurate American team in the morning races in the format of "fourballs", and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. more vigorously resisted in the format of "foursomes", winning two matches, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
The team of Jim Furyk needs 8 points on Sunday in 12 singles to save the trophy.
Flintwood is the first European first-rounder to score four points in a row with Mollynari, nominated for Molliwood after a sensational weekend, just the second pair in Raiders Cup history to score four points in the first four games.
In the format of the fourballs of Wouds and Patrick Reed, they then defeated the tired Wouds and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau without difficulty in a brilliant game with an even more sensitive score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, sometimes showed a great game, but he has lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes formats, plus seven in a row.
While Justin Rose rested before the morning games of the fourballs, he returned to partner Henryk Stenson's foursomes to win 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepke (Brooks Koepka), who took the second place.
Europe failed to achieve its full potential, even though the day in the southwest of Paris was pleasant and windy.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competitions, Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, set the benchmark for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They forced 2&1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the form of fourballs and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 "foursomes" after losing to the former.
Only twice in the history of the Raiders Cup has the team played 4 points of deficit in a single game, but as the owners, the team of Farika (Furyk) only has an undecided score to save the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, Sunday's counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea has declared that it will not disarm unilaterally, without confidence, "in any case"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions had deepened its mistrust of the United States and that, in such a situation, North Korea would never unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the non-denuclearization of nuclear tests and the non-denuclearization of the landfill.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our country's security, and under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known overthrow of Washington’s opposition to a “stage-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea will be rewarded for steps taken gradually, his statement left an impression because it was not automatically rejected by the phenicians.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to achieve "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of the North.
North Korea has tried to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Neither has Washington responded to the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists that 'denuclearisation should come first', and increases the level of pressure imposed by the sanctions to achieve the goal with power, even opposing the 'declaration of an end to war'," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could put us on the road is empty fantasies that are mocked by people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri did not talk about the intentions of Kim’s second meeting with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned in a speech to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister highlighted Kim's three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the other side of this denuclearisation issue were South Korea, not the US, there would be no denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."
However, the tone of Ri's speech drastically differed from last year's when he declared at the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korean missiles to the US mainland was inevitable after "Evil President" Trump had named Kim as a "missile killer."
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that much remains to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until the end of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for what it has done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously, avoiding mistakes, until final and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to achieve the exhaustion of funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the sessions of the UN General Assembly, and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but after a few hours, North Korea accused him of "gangster-worthy demands".
North Korea agreed to dismantle the weapons site and also the nuclear complex at a meeting with Mun this month, if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn a subject on how to get enough rest
A new subject at Harvard University has made students sleep more this year, and it’s an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular culture of brutality that involves caffeine-filled studying through the night.
One teacher discovered that the world’s best university students often don’t even have a basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a subject that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject of study after speaking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and asked, 'Why are you telling me this only now that I'm in my last class?'
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the subject provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievements in learning and sport, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Services, said the university decided to introduce a course of study after learning that students suffer from a severe lack of sleep during the week of study.
The long hours of training include a series of interactive tasks.
One part is the picture of the dorm door, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects performance in sports and how important the bedtime routine is.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then a student city map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarette smoking will affect your health," added Professor Chaisler.
He said that a culture of pride in the ability to learn all night long still exists, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, overwork and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep switches the brain to starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop a subject after attending one of his lectures last year in Harvard’s first course.
He said that the subject of study has opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course accessible to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who receive postgraduate education to master a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaisler advises students to install an alarm clock not only for the time when they get up, but also when they go to sleep, as well as to keep in mind how the "blue lights" emitted by electronic device screens and LED lamps can break the rhythms of the day, burdening behind them.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's gate overthrows Gerard's viruses
The Rangers took another sad game to the guests when Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerard (Steven Gerrard's confused team made a 1-0 loss to Livingston).
The Ibrox team hoped to win the first round since the February 4:1 triumph of St Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt caused Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became the manager of the club, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish champion.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before the end of half-time, and Rangers' lack of inspiration did not look at all after trying to level the score.
"Rangers" drops to sixth place, while "Livingston" is ranked third, and in terms of goal difference, it is surpassed only by "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" can arise another problem, because the assistant of the judge, Calum Spence, was in need of medical attention due to a head injury, which was apparently caused by a throwing object from the far end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left Ayr behind, reaching the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
In turn, Holt used the same 11-player Livingston, who took Hearts one point last week, and he would be happy as his well-trained team oppressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that the Rangers managed the ball more often, but the Livingston better used what they were doing.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start, when Meng's first draw sent Scott Pittman towards Alan McGregor's goal, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then the long-distance Keaghan Jacobs free thrower reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was able to throw the ball only far behind the pole.
The "Rangers" took control, but there was the impression that the last third of the game was hoped for, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt that he should have been beaten in the 15th minute after colliding with Stephen Lawless, but Judge Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
In the first half of the season, Rangers scored only two goals, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed by either Lassana Coulibaly’s headstroke or Ovie Ejagumia’s modest Ovie Edge.
While Livingston's 34th minute may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it already for their efforts.
"Rangers" again failed to cope with Jacobs' planned long-running combination.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
During the break, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly immediately hurried from his line to block.
However, Livingston continued to get the guests to play as they liked, with Litgow and Halket performing one long beat after another.
Holt's team could have continued to lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov hit his head from the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton demanded another penalty late in the game after colliding with Jacobs, but Thompson's request was ignored again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born, who grew up to be a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, as a result of which, in the end, there was a device known as the Geiger counter.
In science, Geiger's counter has also taken its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which the main roles were played externally unconvincing cowboy-type scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these earbuds on, you will be able to hear how the atoms excreted by the radioactivity of these minerals work."
Evans: "Really, it's really a bird!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells
When using this method, cells of the immune system are obtained from the patient, which are converted in the laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" the protein, which is typical of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize bad cells experienced that her ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting cells from the patient's immune system, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can "see" several tumour-specific proteins HER2, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky reported: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignancies," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectal cancers, Professor Berzovsky explained.
A similar approach, when the patient obtains immune-system cells that have been "teached" to attack malignant tumor cells, has been applied to one type of leukemia.
Kanje West, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked Trump's critics after a visit from the SNL.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was swept away in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a separate performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for the 2020 presidential election.
After finishing the third song tonight, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to brush green phrases about Democrats and re-emphasized his support for Trump.
"Only many times when I talk to white people, they ask, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual accusation of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with Vesta's pity was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock attempted to mock the Vest in this way.
And yet West had pity on the viewers because they had treated him badly behind the scenes because of his scalp.
"They made fun of me in the backyard!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head."
They made fun of me!
And they also said that I lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?" and promised to put on "your Superman siege", because that means you can't tell me what to do with me. Do you want the world to move forward?
"Try love!" he said.
Variety reported that his comments caused spectators to whistle at least twice, but the crew members of the show looked upset, and at least one person told the press release: "The studio was completely silent."
The wedding was last invited to replace singer Arianna Grandi (Ariana Grande), whose friend rapper Max Miller (Mac Miller) died a few days ago.
Weszczyk stunned many with a song (I Love It) he performed in a bottle of champagne costume.
The Vesta was supported by conservative group leader Kandance Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the strongest people in the spirit: PATEICOS, THAT DOESN'T GET TO POLICE!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward a person (whether by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his 'art') who, in my opinion, supports and embraces an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he had now become "an entity previously known as the Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and acts like Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, the music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to a "stage artist who was formerly known as Prince".
Indicted for attempted murder in Belfast's restaurant after being stabbed
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident took place in Ballihackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
Prosecutions will be heard by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Herington turns against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known as the swordsman John Snow in HBO's cruel medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the brutal hero’s stereotype, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that he thinks there is a "problem" and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner, Roz Leslie (Rose Leslie), also 31, acknowledged that this problem is important to him.
"I myself can't help but think about the mistakes we made with masculinity right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem as they grow up taking into account the existing problem?"
Kits believes that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "What is innate, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clearly problems with the young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any sequel or mini-series of "Three Horses" after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and the horses are tired".
Starting in November, Kits will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's revamped "True West", which is a story about a film producer and his brother a robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Roza to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Games of Thrones".
"I met my wife on this show as it in a way provided my present family and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series played by John Snow's favorite character Igriti.
The couple divorced in June 2018 in the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased rapidly by 14%.
Health care officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, which indicates a change.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health care officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are an insufficiently protected result of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged to make HIV medicines universally available as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senators' data, sharply opposes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her staff member had published personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia’s lawmakers’ pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the allegations were spread by the "ultra-right" wing of news and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement.
It is reported that the leaked information includes residence addresses and telephone numbers owned by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information online appeared on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Congress, during a Senate group hearing on the allegations of sexually improper behavior by Supreme Court nominee Brett Caveno.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Caveno.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Waters Cabinet, and revealed information about Waters staff.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and completely false!" insisted Waters.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised by these fraudulent and untrue claims, is in no way responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and completely false!"
Waters’ statement soon sparked online criticism, including criticism of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This leads us to the conclusion that her temperament is not in line with that of a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, that person should not be angry.
He must not be a warrior.
He must not speak out on the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and framed."
Fleisher's task was to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrat's fall over Judge Caveno, who was accused of too angry a reaction during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs to get Waters to lose his seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he recorded.
In her statement, Waters informed that her cabinet had warned responsible officials and law-enforcement bodies about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny Anglis 3" review — Rowan Atkinson's spy movie parody left halfway through
It has become customary to look for an association with Brexit in every new film with a British flavour, and this seems to also apply to this revived, Johnny English showcasing the adventure comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with "D with Johnny at Angli" and "Angli".
Is there a new export opportunity for our nation to be cleaned up for ourselves, for how obviously hopeless we are?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Angli, with his eyes wiped and his unusually moving face, has the right to make a whistle after the second revival – his name more than anything else signals that he is a broad-spectrum comic character developed for areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims to enchanting sophistication, is a little Cluzo, a little Mr. Bean, and a little boy who plays one note in the "Chariots of Fire"theme of London's 2012 music.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials in which he left chaos on his way.
The newest Johnny Angle adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes on a helicopter dressed in a medieval armored suit, and the propeller blades hover against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comic impression is well visible, but humor is quite faint and strangely superficial, especially since "serious" movie brands such as "007" and "Impossible Mission" themselves are confidently used in comedy as one of the components.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny Angle's absurd fates are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's mad movie tricks in Bean's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has fallen into a serious mess.
A cyber-hacker has hacked into Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all of the British agents in the area, in dislike of an active agent — the pathetic little Kevin Eldon (Kevin Eldon).
This is the last straw for the prime minister, the pompom and the conflict-ridden person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best, with a character similar to Teresa May, but in the scenario there is not much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform that, since all active spies have been made public, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the indomitable Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and teaches subjects how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because Anglis offers to master the spy profession from the very foundations.
The Englishman is taken back to Whitwell for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his once-deadly assistant Bo, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character who becomes important only at the end of the movie – a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And so now Batman and Robin have returned to her Majesty's secret service to make a huge mistake and meet the beautiful fateful woman depicted by Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers are dangerously bewildered by charismatic tech billionaire, the evil Jason Volta, portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the British computer chaos.
English and Bo begin their wild fun odyssey: disguised as officers, they light up a subtle French restaurant; they create a mess secretly as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta; and English causes absolute chaos by trying to use the virtual realities of the Volts on the head of an inter-display.
Everything is done for the ending, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it has a lot of elements of children's television.
A lot of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary for five days
The Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but pay a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants the business leaders to give the savings to the workers through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes it is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "Policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"This will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an idea that meets the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support this craving at the moment.
A representative of the Labour Party informed: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
The shadow cabinet minister, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour conference to give an edge to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald explained that he was committed to depriving the "mass of directors" and the public service companies of "speculators".
The shadow cabinet minister also plans that the existing average shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour government could implement a "deduction" because of the injustice.
He also approved plans to include working company boards and set up exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of private sector companies’ capital to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes", or the FBI investigation in the Cavendish case could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the office could cause a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley questioned Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," replied Kennedy.
"I said when I turned to the hearing procedure, I said that I spoke to Judge Caveno.
I called him after it happened, when the accusation became known, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
However, the vote of Grem is obviously in stone.
"I have made a decision on Brett Cavendish, and it will require a devastating charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but here's what I know: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names were able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don’t think there is any change expected.”
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, the World Citizens Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will gather in the Great Moor of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, rapper Cardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the international advocacy group Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "activities", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or some other desire to perform a significant activity.
But how successful has been the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to take action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" where people think they can really influence something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters in an effort to achieve various goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion and that will affect more than 2.25 billion people’s lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and statements resulting from its activities for which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the funds allocated to date have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow up fully" by promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's inadequate nutrition messages after more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave a legacy of inadequate nutrition in the history of social injustice," Tracey Ullman, spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that following the launch of more than 5,000 measures, calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition to 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website — "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long way to go for moments of stumbling and failure.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have done, we will also succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use a war fleet to block Russia’s energy exports, says Interior Minister
“If necessary,” Washington could use its war fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's action in Syria, especially in places where it operates under the legitimate government's invitation, is an opportunity to explore new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is located in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe - in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its war fleet, can ensure that sea routes are open, and block them if necessary, so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed an audience who had come to attend an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization calling itself the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to addressing the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they are actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
There are claims that the Trump administration is promoting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials and US President Donald Trump himself are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, in Trump’s words, would make Berlin “dependent” on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Riku Peri.
The US has expressed its negative position against Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), Deter Kempf.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting of the Duma in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president.
“It’s time for women to be in Washington to ‘praise’ the imperfect government, which also means women-presidents,” she wrote in The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the US presidential election."
During the meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Caven.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a survey published Thursday revealed that most Warren supporters do not believe she should run for the 2020 election.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run for office.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey revealed that former governor Devals Patrick had gained more support, receiving 38 percent for the election and 48 percent against.
Still in the context of the possible 2020 election, the names of such high-profile Democratic Party officials as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appear.
The Associated Press reported that Baidens is committed to providing an official decision by January.
Sarah Messilin quotes Trek Messilin PTSD in the myth of Donald Trump
Treks Pailins (26) spent a year in Iraq after being called into service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through after returning, I can attribute to other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and a certain dose of vulnerability that our soldiers are returning with," she told audiences at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Messilina called his arrest a "obvious problem that everyone pretends to not see" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little differently, they return trapped, they return suspicious of whether or not they are deserving of what their war is."
According to the spokesman for the Vasila Police Department, Dan Benet, he was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and holding a gun while in a state of dizziness.
18 states, Colombia's region meets the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy forbidding asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from these 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a brief presentation to the court counsel in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who face obstacles posed by that policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of her violent gangmate" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the Immigrant Appeals Board’s 2014 decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades-old national, federal and international laws".
"The federal law provides that all applications for asylum shall be examined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the relevant claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court adviser's brief statement said.
In addition, the lawyer said in his presentation that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country are damaging the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "secure the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appealed to immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their homeland because of persecution or fears related to their race, religion, nationality, affiliation to a particular social group or political beliefs," Seshons said in his June 11 statement on politics.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts of Palu, doubling the number of survivors in the search process
The situation for the survivors became more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, reassuring her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance service introduces new victims.
“Clean water is scarce.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes and sweeping away the wrecked belongings in the water, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had suffered from a severe earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were cared for outside for the unwaveringly strong after-hours.
His eyes were filled with tears, remembering how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I seem to have been squeezed into the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, noting that his family had arrived in the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my baby.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of attempting to intimidate it with propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, a U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid attachment to China Daily in the state's best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, but China denies it.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, namely that it was a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, as a result of which they impose a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to Sunday's Des Moines Register, claiming that China "is now doubling this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the tradition of free speech and free press, so important to America, to place paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"However, here in the ordinary Beijing news kiosk you will find a limited number of divergent views and you will not see such a divergent true reflection of views that the Chinese people may have in connection with China's worrying economic trajectory," said the report.
He noted that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating women from midterm elections involving the Cavendish scandal
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom a number of allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the upcoming midterm elections they will experience a negative reaction, especially from the side of the party.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been ready to give up their voice.
Such things cannot be revoked," Grant Reeher, a professor of science at Syracuse University Maxwell School of Policy, told The Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Richard doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute incitement to conduct an FBI investigation will be reason enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it either tomorrow or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser of MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hall chanted "November is Coming!" as Republicans, who are headed by the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue the Cavendish candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news portal.
“People say it’s already at a high level, that’s right.
But it could be even higher, especially between suburban floating voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29) who often do not go to the polls even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she set out allegations of sexual violence on the part of a Supreme Court nominee, analysts cite the possible failure of Republicans to continue to nominate this candidate.
"This has become a disturbing chaos for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether Caveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have handled this situation and how they have treated him," Guy Cecil told the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are a little divided about what to believe, according to Ford and Caveno, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are more likely to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are more likely to believe Cavendish’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno probably lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, following Fleck's instigation.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Caveno had sexually assaulted them while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Judge during his studies in Jela in the 1980s showed her his genitals at a party.
A global web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the open source platform "Solid" by Childrens-Lee.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Childers-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses "Solid" technology so that people can build their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in one browser.
Personal online data storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal authority using data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently operates Childrens-Lee, Brouss, a security platform acquired by IBM, some external developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Childrens-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change by completely reversing all their business models in one night.
"We're not asking for his permission."
Childrens-Lee said in a blog post published on Saturday that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new web based on Solid."
In 1994, Childers-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Kindersam-Lee has had an influential opinion in the discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Childrens-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, Global Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new era of the web," Kinders-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Commemoration of the Victorian Cross awarded to a clergyman during World War I
For the past 100 years, the only Church of England pastor has received the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a fighter.
The Honourable Colonel Bernard Wens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaukort.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he did not recognize it as the highest British military award ever.
In a Saturday show in Rashden, Northamptonshire, her two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Wens led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and large fires caused by guns and mortars."
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with the utmost confidence before taking over the gun zone, where he formed three groups.
Lieutenant Colonel Venu was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's action was "something I could never do, and at the same time it is also a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also crowned by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wens said he felt "honored to be part of this show" and noted that "the true value of the hero is evidenced by the support given by many people."
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206, but instead waited for Pig Pepa
Imagine spending the whole night upstairs to see Bellator 206, but in the end you are denied the chance to watch this main event.
The poster in San Jose included 13 fights, including six main maps, which were broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised by the switch to Pig Pep.
Some were really misunderstood when they had stayed awake all night until dawn awaiting the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "an unsuccessful joke".
"The government has determined that this type of content is not acceptable after 6.00 a.m., so the transmission to the children's program took place," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator.
"Pussy Pepa," "yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said he would be working on scheduling schedules for future viewers in the UK to watch these broadcasts.
"Thinking about repeating the broadcast, I think we can sort of solve it," Cockers said.
"However, the clock there is at six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switching of the broadcast, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problems.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We have tried to please the fans, but we have made an effort.
This is an unsuccessful situation."
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs, directed by Lauren Laverne, he said he had begun to talk about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The long-term program's permanent director, Kirsty Young, has been away for several months due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast from society in Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "undervalued" by others, because "in society it is not accepted that both girls and boys can be liked".
He said: "To this day, the feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main driver that gave me the strength and endurance to succeed."
He said that you wanted to prove that there is "something" so that people don't get discouraged when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-level LGBT campaign leader and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to address the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised the unprepared."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, claiming that the age difference has never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much at such a young age" (her first Olympics were at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "all perspective" had changed.
"Before the first year, all that was important to me was winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked Daley was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in front of the hosts in the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired her choice of her first song — Heather Small’s performance of “Proud”, which resonated with her on her way to the Olympics and continues to blow her head.
The program "Desert Island Discs" is heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. British summer time.

American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday playing his 47th Raiders Cup playoff match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
Mikelson, who has already been in the championship for the 12th time every two years, captain Jim Furyk was seated on a reserve bench Saturday for four-ball games and two-pair games.
Instead of being at the center of activity, as has so often been with US teams, the fifth winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game in the hope of correcting what is oppressing him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the height of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for a tense fight on the uneven pitch of Le Golf National, where imprecise beatings are regularly punished.
And if the game in itself is not scary enough, Mikelson will fight in Sunday's ninth match with the exact British open championship winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the young Tommy Flitwood (Tommy Fleetwood), this is the fourth time.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in starting 12 singles games, succeed in leading, Mikelson's game could prove crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his team-mate without unnecessary words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, he folded me on the back, he put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He’s very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams in the past and also this week.
I don't think I ever imagined him playing in two games.
I imagined more, but it all turned out the way it turned out, and that's what we'll be counting on.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mikelson will give Nick Faldo the record for the most played matches in the Raiders Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raider's Cup career, which never really coincided with his individual record highs.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, suffered 20 losses and seven indiscriminate games, although Furik claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible advantages.
"He's fun, sarcastic and cunning, he likes to think about people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"I think the youngest players liked to go shopping this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn (Thomas Bjorn) knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly disappear
European skipper Thomas Björn knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Raiders Cup in the last days of a single game can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Danis made his debut in the 1997 games in Valderrama, where the team of opponents, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, won five points over the Americans, but only now he reached the finish line with a very small point lead, namely, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81>
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a significant lead in Valderrama; we had a lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a small lead," said Bjorn (pictured) in the National Golf Championship, "with a look at the group of 10-6, looking at the 2018 edition.
Thus, history will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give everything back to yourself.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not end until the points you get are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to win this trophy and we will focus on it as well.
I’ve always said that I’ve focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who’s on the other side – the world’s best players.”
Relieved of the performance of his golfers on the golf course, Bjorn remarked: "I've never been happy for an early morning.
There will be new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow is an individual game, and that's a completely different thing.
It’s great when you have a partner at your side at times when everything is going well, but your golfer’s skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message you have to pass on to your players, namely, so that they in the next day game give everything back.
Now you are leaving your partner and also he has to manage to show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents, Captain Jim Furrick will see to it that his players show their best performance directly in individual rather than partner games. The exceptions are only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furik himself has won both sides of this important last-day tournament – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and afterwards, suffering a defeat when European teams achieved a sensational success, which later became known in the golf world as the “Miracle at Medinah”.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, brought his players together for a last-day fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get to the quick shot you experienced in Brooklyn, you experienced in Medina.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates a great deal of pressure for the midfield games.
We created our composition accordingly and arranged the guys in the way we thought was right. We will try to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy in the lead game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood in the list.
"I put the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the tournament," Bjorn said of the single-player players.
Re-delayed commissioning of a new German warship
The newest frigate of the German Navy was due to be put into service in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz flagship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a representative of the military field.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in the distant year 2007 will replace obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful rifle, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods, allowing new frigates to be deployed for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the latest technology warships that would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries will already be obsolete by the time it enters into service, in the note "Die Zeit".
The unsuccessful frigate F125 was visible in all headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipyard after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for such a move, but the German media cited a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render warships invalid if they were used in combat missions.
Software deficiencies were a particularly significant factor, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels are operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, which is only half of the older Bremen-class frigate crew.
It also turned out that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make its improvements in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
Along with the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) also became a significant problem.
Its cost has reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion instead of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in view of the recent warnings that German naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet was indeed "beginning to run out of usable ships".
The official claimed that over time this problem has deteriorated considerably, as old ships are decommissioned but no new ships are delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had joined the fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in a Scottish highland property, is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in the process of finding food.
The findings are expected to bring new clarity to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help them with future protection measures.
Scientists from the Scottish National Trust at Invereves Gardens in Westeros will study punworms, pygmies, as well as brown longworms and aquatic night owls.
In the main places on the property will be placed special recorders, which will track the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of call of bats and which species perform the specific actions.
A biotope map and report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view that reflects the behavior of bats.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are at risk of construction and development work affecting the loss of hiding places and habitat for bats.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, just like flypaper and some building materials chemical treatments, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a complex feedback-locating method to detect insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the problem of bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of bat hideouts and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only specially designed reserve for bats in Scotland, owned by Threave, in Damfries and Galway, where eight of the ten species of bats found in Scotland live.
Property manager David Thompson argues that this territory is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a suitable biotope in general.
But there are still quite a few things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stresses that it is important to check the location of the bats before carrying out the maintenance of the property, as it may happen that up to 400 females and their young are killed due to the unconscious destruction of one female hiding place, thus possibly destroying the entire population locally.
Hedgehogs are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed in their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a worker of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for several of their species we just don't know how they do it."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges by appointing lawyers to sue German magazine in court
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” claiming that people “want to pay attention” using his name.
Her lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese and Turin-based football star Juventus is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after making these claims, Ronaldo, 33, via Instagram online video turned to his 142 million followers, calling this information “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," said the five-year-old winner of the Ballon d'Or award.
"They want to be famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine," added the player, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel magazine for what they called “an unacceptable disclosure based on suspicion of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to the extent of the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a hotel "Palms Hotel and Casino" "suite" class room in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the District Court of the State of Nevada, after meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he anally raped the woman.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and said he was "a 99 percent" "good guy", but fell in the "one percent" temptation.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this happened after a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to accept the terms of this settlement, because the incident left a permanent injury.
When the statements were made, Ronaldo planned to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer he went for 100 million euros to the Italian club Juventus.
Brexit: UK 'forever regretted' loss of automakers
"The United Kingdom will regret it forever if it loses its world-leading position in car manufacturing after Brexit," Business Secretary Greg Clark said in a statement.
They are "concerned" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily suspend production near Darby's Burnaston plant.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of Brexit could put jobs at stake without a deal.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union member states.
"I think that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a treaty and about how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month.
According to automakers, the main concerns are about the endangered supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "search-in-time" principle, where custom-made cars receive parts from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions on the border that could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, "Toyota" would not be able to hold more than one day worth of inventory in its Darbyshire factory, so production would have to be stopped.
Mr Clarke said that the Chequers withdrawal plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would, as I would say, not only benefit from the present moment, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The message to this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully continue the very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, rising costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works at the factory as the union's merger coordinator, said that his colleagues are increasingly anxious: "From experience, I can say that as soon as a position disappears, it doesn't come back."
The government spokesman said: "We have submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House reports
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Caveno continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Miller, who is investigating the interference in the Russian election, the link between Trump's tools and Russia, as well as possible violations of the rule of law by the president.
For months now, there has been a debate in Washington over whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Miller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording the talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denies this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there were talks about his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said he "would rather" not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which testified to both Caveno and one of the women who accused them of committing the sexual offense.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Caveno’s allegations, continuing to delay the Senate’s vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was visiting Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to let the press know about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Director Kriss Vallass (Chris Wallace) asked why.
Sanders said the lack of friction was not related to dislike of the television reporter's "glory cravings", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are famous cravings."
She then proposed direct contact between Trump, resulting in increased press interest.
"The President is involved in more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding, without providing more details, "we're interested in the number."
Sanders stated that the briefings will still take place, but, "if the press will be able to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it is undeniably better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of that, and you can see that we have done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it will happen instead of a press briefing when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President demonstrated his reasons this week in New York, dedicating an uncontrolled and sometimes odd expression to the crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU staff of the Scottish NHS about fears related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish for resilience after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the MSP less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of permanent applications for status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, leading to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of an agreement.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit our patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
In Tennessee, the state's Tigers defender Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury he suffered in a game on Saturday in which he scored 31-27 in the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessean sports reporter Mike Organs.
In Tennessee, team head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a short time ago.
"He came to the sidelines and said it collapsed," said Ried.
While Abercrombie was on the sidelines, the coaches and the medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on the rails and took him for further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/severity of the injury" so far, and the Tennessee state team is trying to figure out at what point the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, representing the Red Shirt, is in his first season after Ilionis's substitution for the Tennessee State Team.
In the case of a person who is not a citizen of the Union, the Commission shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the person is not a citizen of the Union.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state tax when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the resulting additional funds will be used to help the homeless under the new "Tory" plan.
This will neutralise Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
A higher state tax will be applied to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year can be collected, which can be channelled to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state tax when buying property in the United Kingdom and diverting the additional funds obtained to provide assistance to the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at more affordable prices and addressing the wealthiest part of society.
The increased state tax will be applied to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to the money raised by the government in its efforts to combat the problem of homelessness.
The premium included in the current State levy, including the application of a higher level of levy on the purchase and lease of a second home two years ago, could be even three per cent.
The Treasury provides that such a step can supplement its budget up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their homes.
Many wealthy country territories, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower state tax so more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Ms May to give up quotas on affordable housing to address the UK housing problem.
Mr Corbina has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including reforms on the control of rents and the removal of housing for no reason.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new housing.
Ms May said: "Last year, I mentioned that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream of having a better quality of life for each new generation.
And that means arranging our degraded housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be bought equally easily by foreign companies and non-UK residents, its hard-working British residents.
For many, the dream of their home has become too far gone, and the harsh problem of homelessness is still topical."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to run Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is to eventually become a Scotland manager.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to rebuild the Northeastern Club, which currently occupies third place in the first league with three points from the top.
This year, he moved to the Stadium of Light after the return of St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B Cup, and that's it," Ross told Scottish BBC's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland games with my father in Hampden Park, and it has always invited me to come back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in managing the club."
Rosa's predecessors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poy Diio and Gus Paulo Canioet.
The former chairman of Alloa Athletic claims that he did not feel anxious to follow the footsteps of such a large club of recognized managers, having previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
“My success will now be judged by whether I can return to the Premiership of this club.
You will be able to see the results of your research, and you will be able to see the results of your research.
"It will not be an easy task to return to the Premiership of the club, but I will most likely believe that I will be successful here only when this task has been accomplished."
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, having previously served for some time as deputy director at Dumbarton and spending a 15-month period with Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa recover from the drop to the third level and helped St Mirren win the championship in the same season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than he did during his player career at clubs such as Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They probably had real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for the "Alloa".
“I really believed that management was my real calling — much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good success, I could live from it and also enjoy certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I’ve always wanted to drive and now I’m doing it. It feels like I’m in the right place, I haven’t felt so good all my life.”
You can listen to the full "Sportsound" interview on Sunday, September 30th on Scottish Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 British summer time.
The survey found that the best time to enjoy a pint is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evening.
The summer heat wave has caused the less popular pubs in Britain to collapse, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data showed that the sales of bars and pubs had increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents CGA, a business consulting agency that compiled the data, said: "The continuous sunny weather and England's prolonged participation in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend to its June 2, i.e., the club's profits were up a bit.
Restaurants, which declined by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in bars and bars was most grateful, as they experienced much higher ups than restaurants experienced downs.
Food-based taverns also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurant staff felt.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The market for beverages in bars and pubs increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the market for food decreased by 3 per cent."
RSM recreation and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of a wide range of social or sporting events are the major factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful to the additional constant cost pressure.
With regard to food suppliers, the long and hot summer could not have come at the most inappropriate time, and time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we usually experience in August will provide such a much-needed environment."
Total sales growth among bars and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in brand sales.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which is the UK’s sales supervisor for the pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyses data from the 47 operating groups where the total turnover exceeds <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an industry-wide benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey, which included 20,000 high school students, revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
This has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show to parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake profiles on Instagram’s photo-sharing site is growing rapidly.
This has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "clean main" account to show to parents and also drive private accounts.
A mother who attacked the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC) found that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It's frightening that so many teenagers create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
You will not be able to find the right person for you, but you will be able to find the right person for you.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors without executive powers.
Doyle is Scotland’s award-winning indoor and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those driven by sport to use her extensive international experience for their benefit over the past decade.
"Eilid is being treated with great respect throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the global athletics community, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will achieve an extraordinary amount by involving them in the board," said Beethoven.
Doyle said: "I would like to act as a 'facilitated voice' and I hope I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus winning four Olympic gold medals overall, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, was unable to go through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day a month ago I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't go.
Doctors claimed that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I am fully recovering, I have learned to walk again and I can already do agility training today!
Thank you for the inspiring words!"
Opinions share on breast milk pump advertising that compares mothers with cows
Breast milk pumping company has provided shared views online in connection with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the so-called "world's first silently portable breast pump", consumer technology company "Elvie" has released a sticky ad to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new pump to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a wall-filled cowhouse to a song whose lyrics sound like, "Yes, I wiped myself out, but you didn't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not testicles, they're my breasts."
The song continues: "Suck up, suck up, I'm feeding the babies, suck up, suck up, I'm sucking up my ladies."
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has evoked a wide resonance online.
The 77,000 times watched and hundreds of times commented on video has received shared feedback from viewers, and many claim that it highlights in light of the dairy industry's "horror".
"Very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they are born," he wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump inconspicuously fits breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to promote breast milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
It was also said: "Advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "intriguing".
“I think it’s an excellent idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Milk sucking made me feel like a cow.
Advertisement is a bit crazy, but I understood the idea.
This is a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment states: "It's a fun ad for moms who suck milk (often at work or in the toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not advertising that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with the unobtrusive pumps placed on their bra.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many lactating women claim to feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely silent, it does not have wires and pipes, and it casually fits into the breastplate designed for lactating women, allowing them to move freely, hold babies and even participate in events outside the home.
Anna Balarina, Mother’s partner and creative director, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch on the market.
Drawing a parallel between women who give birth to milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milking, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the astonishing sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the fore.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue in the image of Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent town near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased rapidly, although relatively as many people cross the border each month as before, and partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Typically, most sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that openly applying for a child would jeopardise their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and these data would also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously punished.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or sponsor household members are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these individuals are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to persecute such people," Mr Albens said.
According to the asylum workers, in an effort to deal with children’s cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention rather than after 60 days, as the previous standard foresees.
Many will use videoconferencing instead of arriving in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unsuitable for release will be quickly evicted.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, according to information provided by asylum workers and testimonies obtained from the system in recent months.
Lawyers argued that these concerns will aggravate in larger objects such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town without spending enough time on their emotional preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends could cause injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupied armies" to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eighth-year-old war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syria on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "it will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must step down immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes, "the war against terrorism is almost over."
He said Damascus would continue to “fight the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared,” cleared of both terrorist groups and “any foreign military presence.”
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions were great for them to return, and blamed "individual Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" as the refugees would not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance for the reconstruction of the country until an agreement on an end to the war is concluded between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last dumpster-backed city, has created an opportunity to speed up political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has set deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked group Jabhat al-Nusrah, which will be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualems put forward the conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and perhaps many liberal observers expect, the impeachment and scandal prematurely put an end to his presidency.
And in that case, "this will be the most dramatic final of the Presidency of all time!"
At the moment, there is no evidence of the relaxation of the observers.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN’s most favorable broadcast time have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC has nearly tripled to reach 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers in the most favorable broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichela Medow show) is at the top of the cable rating with 3.5 million of the top.
"It's a fire that attracts a lot of people, because it's something we don't understand," explained Neal Baer, the backbone of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor." This drama tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after being attacked in Cape Town.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is his theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told her that I would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He replied, 'Because he's laughing at me,'" said Miss Skovel.
Chaos is, to a certain extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rue v. Way case, whether the immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet it is more than to be informed by a citizen when Daniel is in a position to watch at six o'clock a.m. a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book Fear, Paul Manafort will be in a position to announce 15 thousand dollars from a type of bomb.
I, for example, will never again perceive Super Mario as before.
"Part of what he does that gives the impression of reality shows is that he fills you with information every day," Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show Pawn Stars explained about the glory of Trump's show.

When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time in Kauai on the North Shore was sunny, 80 degrees (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in the rooms where, without losing his eye, he watched the MSNBC show while recording CNN.
He was unable to stand even when Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court is threatening to air.
"I remember the times when we made all these crazy shows and when people said, 'This is the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from the outside in the campaigns of the most intense parliamentary mid-term elections
It is no wonder that the Pennsylvania 17th Congressional constituency is seeking money thanks to the transformation of the Congressional constituency, which will result in the two existing MPs fighting for one seat.
This recently remodeled Pittsburgh nomadic area is linked to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special election in another area in the spring of last year.
The member will fight another existing MEP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were reworked.
Competition in the new 17th district has sparked a fight between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Members became known in Pennsylvania when they won the widely watched March elections in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania with a small victory.
Republicans had held these seats for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won by 20 points in the area.
Politicians give the Democrats a small preponderance.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then rethought
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and he stayed at a hotel in Panama until his partner laid out the Trump organization management team behind the door.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the grounds of "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately 140 million dollars from the United States, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and a targeted restriction on visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates have reached their highest levels.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an approximation effort to prevent migrants from relocating to the US.
In mid-September, the country's top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially completely ending the considerations of punishing El Salvador.
Diplomats reported that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to attend a conference scheduled in mid-October to show how seriously the administration is emphasizing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties on the part of Washington.
The White House representative, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not wish to give more details on the debates characterized by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to be consulted in internal negotiations if their anonymity were to be maintained.
What he said was confirmed by an external analyst approaching the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity will be kept.
Studying History
The second stone in the garden could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller that Mr. Trump may have delayed justice, which has a lot of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party takes the lead in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this structure and possibly to his fellow jury at the very moment when he is already about to meet with the electorate again.
There are many "buts" and I am not saying that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his comrades in Europe.
There are choices that we will all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the fight.
In 1938, the German commanders were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, unless the West had opposed and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We stumbled and missed the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodthirsty.
History revolves around such turning points, and the irresistible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trump releases Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he proposed to secretly record a conversation with the president and wondered about his inadequacy for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How should we respond if the FBI's just-requested investigation into Brett Caveno is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress, which will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not endure all these trials, democracy will have a long winter.
However, I believe that we will succeed in all of this with reference to what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by exactly the same Nazi regime that was once a myth in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

"Rangers" star Graham Dorrans (Graham Dorrans) feels optimistic about the fight with Vienna "Rapid"
The "Rangers" will take on the Vienna "Rapid" on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the spectacular undecided game in Spain with "Villarreal" earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League Group G.
Road injury prevented center attacker Grams Dorans from resuming the season until the draw with Villarreal 2-2, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
“We went into the game believing we could make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have overcome them in the end, but the overall result is fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we broke up in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they scored well in the previous game, but I am confident that with the help of our supporters, we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly heavy, but now there are new cools that I feel good about.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women can’t sleep because they’re worried about their pension bills
Although the respondents knew clearly what kind of care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed the matter with family members.
Approximately half of individuals in a nationwide study indicated that they did not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by family members, but they’re not doing anything to say it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for providing long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with an amount of money to cover these costs, or insurance using your assets — the main thing for you to have the money.
Develop your own legal documents. Avoid legal battles even before they have started.
Talk to the authorized person on health issues so that you have a trusted person who will supervise your health care and provide specialist action according to your wishes if you are unable to express them on your own.
Consider also the possibility of granting financial authority.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you can't do it on your own.
And do not forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is taken to the hospital for emergency help.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan, so that such a situation does not surprise you.
"And it's not just about the finances, it's also about who's the doctor," Martina said.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan is developed."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday has killed at least 384 people. The number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to disrupted communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the strong 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu following a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palu and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of the narrow bay on the western shore of Sulawesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 there were 379,800 people living there.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived in the area, which is an administrative region belonging to the province, in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali (Morowali), on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have been victims of the tsunami on several occasions over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
Tsunamis also gassed over western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes regularly occur.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia on the shores of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Java, Indonesia's most populous island, in the south, causing a tsunami that hit the southern shore, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A strong 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves of up to 10 meters high that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake near the Earth's surface hit the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing damage and panic as it resembled the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed by the wrecking buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern islands.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Payne’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Pailin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance-woman tried to call the police to report, as she claimed, the crimes occurred, he took her phone.
He has been detained in the pre-trial detention facility of Mat-Su and has been fined $500 in security, according to KTUU.
He went to court on Saturday, where, when asked if he confessed to being guilty, he declared that he was "certainly not guilty".
He has been charged with three Class A offences, which could result in a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal offences have been brought against Messilin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Peilin.
Her mother, Sarah Peilin, called the police and reported that an attack had occurred.
This case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, the arrest of a report of domestic violence and the wearing of a gun in a dizzy state in connection with this incident.
His girlfriend says he's gonna punch her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticised Sarah Peilin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome on his return from service in Iraq.
Earthquake caused by tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after Friday’s earthquake hit the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media broadcasts videos showing the moment of the clash.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Want to Request Sentencing of Rarely Used Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorism in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sajfullo Saipov, who is suspected of an act of terror in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to make an attack on a velocity along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he hit pedestrians and a cyclist on his way.
To justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury, as mentioned in the announcement on the intention to demand the death penalty, submitted to the New York South District Court.
According to the court document, both of these charges may be punishable by death.
Within weeks of the attack, the federal grand jury accepted an indictment for the prosecution of Saipov in 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use for the prosecution of organized crime and for the prosecution of non-organized crime cases.
The attack required "significant planning and prior intent", the prosecutors explained, saying that Saipova's attack was "scary, cruel and inhumane".

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since prosecutors in the New York South District Court have filed charges in a case that could lead to the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York federal case in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was sentenced to death after being accused of spying on Soviets during the First Cold War.
The death penalty for Rosenberg couple in the electric chair was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, for days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse for the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, according to police reports.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
The police reported that he has also requested permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has dismissed 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "naturally dissatisfied" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the intention of demanding the death penalty rather than accepting pleading guilty in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing injury to all parties involved," Patton explained.
The team of Saipova’s defenders has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the imposition of the death penalty.

During the protest, Najjel Far<0xC4><0x81>js promised to "mobilize the people's army" at a conservative conference today.
The former leader of the UK's Independent Party said politicians should feel the Eurosceptic anger when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone announced to the march in Birmingham that Britain would have resigned long ago if Mr Farage had been the Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that Ms May will have to face in trying to merge her dissenting party was demonstrated by conservatives who supported leaving the EU and joined a separate city-wide protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan on the future relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union (the Chequers compromise) and to feel the attacks of those who want to leave the EU, those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
Allies insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Boun's "Leave Means Leave" at the Solihull rally announced that he wanted to throw the Mei's plan into the garbage (to Chuck Chequers).
He proposed to make Mr Far<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xBE> an ally and entrust him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the saying, we would have already left," Bouns announced.
The MEP from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw the May Plan away!"
On the basis of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to be servants!
We want to pass our laws in our own country!"
Mr Boun ignored the assumption that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is absolutely wrong."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not a favorite of the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please give up the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to May, she added: "The prime ministers remain in place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said the politicians in the myth should feel pressured if they are going to disobey the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and our politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to let our politicians who are planning to hand over Brexit feel the pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never relax until we make ourselves an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Pali<0xC4><0x87>i walked through Birmingham before a two-hour rally took place in the city centre.
Unknowing activists welcomed the Conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group's weekend meeting.
Workers' Party representative Lords Adonis laughed at the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced with the party's applications at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and still, and still, undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farss.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider running for president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is "thinking carefully" about running for president of the United States after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future in the City Hall of West Massachusetts.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November and is running against GOP state Republican Geopho Dil, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign vice president.
It is speculated that she will be the main person who will dare to run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using the city hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she planned to run for president.
To which Warren replied that it was the right time for "women to be in Washington who will "reward" the imperfect government, which also means women-presidents."
In the case of the shooting of LSU basketball player Simsa has been detained
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a person was arrested on suspicion of shooting a LSU basketball player in the Kind of Simsa case on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that at 11:00 a.m. Daiteon Simpson, 20 years old, was detained at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for help in recognizing the video of the man seen.
Sims (20) shot and killed near the Southern University student town on Friday morning.
"The way Sims was shot in the head, as a result of which he died immediately," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, via 247 Sports.
The way he hurried to defend his friend and the Simpsons shot him.
Simpson was questioned and he admitted to being at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and also admitted to having shot Way Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is in the East Baton Rouge Village Police Station.
6 feet 6 junior, who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and playing an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and scoring 2.9 rebounds in the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the world championship after the team allows him to defeat Sebastian Fettel
When Walter Botass qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes team will play an important role in the competition.
From the start, Bottass started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two races and called on Fetello to attack his teammate.
Fetel was the first to enter the garage and left Hamilton in a hurry to deal with the rest, which was probably crucial.
The Mercedes driver filled the lap later and lagged behind Fetella, but Hamilton continued to clinch the lead after a forceful match, which saw the Ferrari rider constantly leave the inside free, risking being left behind after a double maneuver to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the race as he focused on the tyres to quickly reach the finish line and beat Kimi Raikonenu in fourth.
In the end, he arrived at the garage in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job of getting one and two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senators Diana Finstein at Saturday's rally for her reluctance to release a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavenna of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony she gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that the people there were "evil, accidental, and unreliable."
"Something that can happen and something beautiful that already happens in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When I read the press releases and the flooded information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you skip the information?
Remember her answer to the question...did you drop the document? — "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait a minute.
We did it...No, we didn’t do it,” he added, senators intonation.
A letter was sent to Feinstein in July detailing what Ford accused Caveno of, and the contents of the letter were disclosed in early September, but Feinstein denies that it had happened in her office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusations, I'm not "floating" her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did as well."
But her denial displeased the President, who commented on the situation in a Saturday night rally as follows: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She probably didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own benefit.
"They are purposefully tuned,to regain power by any means."
If you see evil, no name, they don't care what they're hurting, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyers throws two goals for Giants in a game against Dundee
Dundee Stars played for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday's answer game with 5:3 Dundee.
"Giants" gained an early lead when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller scored the goal.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney led the housekeepers before Dwyer regained the Giants.
If you want to be able to make a difference in your life, then you need to be able to make a difference in your life.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the guys of Adam Kiffes, who won the Dundee on Friday night by 2 to 1.
It was the fourth meeting of the teams this season, in which the Giants had won the previous three games.
In the case of a non-compliance with the provisions of this Directive, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council.
After the tight start of the game, Sullivan introduced the homers in the game 13:10 before Mets Markward played for the Cowboys to score a goal and level the score at 15:16.
Dwyer was convinced that the "Giant" is regaining leadership at the first opportunity, when he scored his second goal in the sound of the first period of the game tonight.
In the event of a breach of this Regulation, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Regulation.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time during the end of the second half of the game, and he also scored a convincing goal in the final period to lead his team to victory.
The Giants, who have lost in four of five games, will finish the next game on Friday, where they will face Milton Keynes at home.
Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to be rescued during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised as a hero after he sacrificed himself to make a plane with hundreds of passengers safely take off from land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a strong earthquake on Friday shook Sulawesi Island, causing a tsunami.
The territory continues to see strong post-Friday and many are trapped in the muddy city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Aggs refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower, which was swinging strongly.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be safely lifted in the air.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it might collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation official Johannes Siraits said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he replies.
Meanwhile, public authorities have worried that the death toll could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is clear that the beautiful will grow because many more human bodies are under the rubble, as well as many impossible to access," said agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, reaching a height of 6 meters, destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and the necessary supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "In one minute, the ambulance service brings in new victims.
Clean water is deficient.
Small shops are crowded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is urgently helping survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the state military enlistment: "I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already shocked by the Lombok earthquakes this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini"says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline made a flight during which it crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has disappeared, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing plane.
Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon that they could not answer for one of the passengers — a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Locals with boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane landed in the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them are in a stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly after taking off from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway had been overestimated.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane using the emergency exits because the water was only up to the waist.
He said that the stewards panicked and screamed, and that he had a mild head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship's dock also helped in rescue operations using an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years, no one is related to "Air Niugini".
A psychoanalytic commentator explains the course of events in the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday provided evidence in a re-tried case where a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, commentator on psychoanalysis at the US Department of Judicial Expertise, testified for several hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information from the phone to put together what the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Telly, and the 19-year-old indictee, Jessica Chambers, did on the night of her death.
Rowlet said he received location data from several phones indicating that Talis was with Chambers on the night of her death, challenging his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified in the courtroom on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Telly was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telly said he knew Chambers only about two weeks before she died.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rowlet said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telly deleted text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers's phone.
"He erased him from his life," said Heil.
It is expected that the defense will give its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the sworn-in later that day.
Group "The High Breed": What is deliberate hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about this genre of music, with their music delivering a positive message.
"The High Breed", from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has deviated from its beginnings on messages of a political nature and those when solving problems of a social nature.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, a nanny accuses a couple of being fired after receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a babysitter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous text message from a mother complaining that the babysitter "is black again."
The couple denies being racist by equating a court case with "extortion".
Lindsey Plasko-Flaksman, a mother of two, expressed her rejection when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"THE WEEK OF THE WEEK, AGAIN BLACK," Plasko-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurice, in addition, twice.
Understanding his incompetence, the "smooth" Plasco-Flaxman discounted Maurice, stating that her previous babysitter, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been expecting Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Maurice has now filed a lawsuit seeking compensation for dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for a job with secure living, which she initially applied for, in addition to having no employment contract.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denies the accusations that they are racist, claiming that terminating Maurice's employment was a sensible decision because they feared that after her insult, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, the husband, said to the Post.
"But, would you entrust your children to someone you treated harshly, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very "complicated" situation.
"Are you really going against anything in this way?
This is not an acceptable action," added the investment banker.
While litigation is still ongoing, public opinion quickly courts over social networks, denying them their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were worried that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to 'put yourself in the shoes of someone' who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It’s very surprising now to learn what we know about Paddington’s great achievements.”
Telling that her father, who worked for the operator of the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that in the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweetly bitter" after the father's death
Speaking of Paddington, whom she calls a "very important member of the family," her father quietly boasted of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and he wasn't great," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: you’re proud even if you haven’t done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the merits to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors were constantly fighting for her life.
"Nobody called regularly and said it was very bad and it is expected that she would not survive," said Ednana-Laperouza.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying she's going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Well, I love you very much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even sooner, and now it's all over.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I could not enjoy or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
It took me a lot of energy to get through."
Eventually, already mourning the loss of her daughter, Ednana-Laperouza boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I put my head down and tears ran all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Attach Cards to Bridges to Prevent Suicide
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, act to help others not take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey reinforce cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
David's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I do every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lyndhurst, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognizes him by his smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted up" always and everywhere."
However, he quit work before he died because he was "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards, "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit still, you have to talk.”
Humphrey, who has been Davis’s girlfriend for years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say I'd feel sad or be depressed or in any quotes I'd feel," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning — when the children opened the gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a great trauma to the children, but they have to cope with it: "It's ruining the whole family.
That's what separates us.
But we must all continue and fight."

The future of Britta Caveno hangs in the air as the FBI opens an investigation
“I think if we could really get what he’s asking for — in a time- and scale-limited investigation — we might be able to reach a little consensus,” Fleek said Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was “dividing” between the guerrillas.
Why do Caveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is just a coincidence.
The midterm elections are in five weeks, on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to go badly, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a husband from among themselves to the highest court.
George W. Bush called senators, lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's tenure and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 seats belong to Republicans and 49 seats to Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide the vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "reduced" the number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2011, when the number was 2,706.
Park said tighter border controls are key to North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China’s political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and are forced to deport them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation talks.
This took place after a historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they agreed to work together on large trains to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since these negotiations.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our country's security, and under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nenzi Pelosi calls Bret Caveno "hysterical" and claims that he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
The court’s minority leader, Nensi Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno “hysterical” and claimed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in response to Cavendish's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Caveno was emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early argument, Caveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and his high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats on the committee, citing the charges against him of "grotesque and cohesive destruction of character" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Caveno's testimony is a justification for his inability to work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the attitude with which he addresses Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Caveno if she were approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say it -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not suitable for a position not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the current workplace court," Pelosi said.
Caveno is currently a judge in the Washington District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has been concerned about the possibility that Caveno will make decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Type because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Caveno circumvented questions as to whether he would reject Supreme Court decisions.
"There is no proper time for a hysterical and biased person to work in court, but we would expect us to gladly say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'," Pelosi said.
But women have to hold themselves in their hands.
It is a denunciation, for months and years everything has piled up "around the edges", but she is not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, do you think?"
She went on to say, "Once I was really helped by a woman who was a manager at a company who said she was crying when she was angry, but she invented a technique -- when she got angry and she started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You can think I'm sorry.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to walk.
And I thought it was great."
Tears as a form of discharge of anger are only partially recognized, because they are misunderstood in the very foundations.
One of my brightest memories is from an old work in which the percentage of men was expressed, when I once cried inexpressibly because of anger, when I was caught behind the neck by an older woman – a restrained leader (woman), from which I always had a bit of fear that pulled me on.
"Never let them see you cry!" she told me.
"They don't know you've been transferred.
They think you're upset and they'll just be happy that you managed to "swallow under your skin."
Patrícia Shredder, then a U.S. Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his campaign presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in extramarital affairs, left the ship, also known as "making fools" and resigned from the election, Shredder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last they wanted to have another one.
There were those who called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She later took part in the campaign, she lagged behind fundraising and promised not to participate in the election unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to male representatives, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — thankful to the people who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and speak to voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism — in which she was "smeared."
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Shredder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my skull.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China trade war may be beneficial for Beijing
The main pretexts for how the trade war between the US and China began are being concealed and until the fight ends, disagreements between countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year on taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the unit’s value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), immediately charging half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "welcomes" each time, the youngest being a five to ten percent rate for $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has announced that it is committed to responding to the US one-on-one and is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could shrink.
In order for Washington to step down, it would be necessary to agree to certain demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure can have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the economies of the two countries.
"The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are truly more dangerous than previously recognized by the observers," said Abigail Grays, a New American Security researcher who focuses on AI.
Syria is "ready" to take back the refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily take back refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country that has been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on land is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists to their normal condition.
There are all the conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN accepts that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people are still living in the country and they need humanitarian aid.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime will accept assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the state will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
European golf team sensationally wins the Raiders Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raiders Cup, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost in Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raiders Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by the Danish Thomas Bjorna scored 14.5 points, which was necessary to beat the US sample.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the tournament, threw his T-shirt in the water at PAR 3 16th pit, stepping in on Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of four players who have ever managed to get a 5-0-0 score since 1979, when the tournament is played according to the existing format.
In the case of a non-compliance with the provisions of this Directive, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the procedure referred to in Article 4(2) of this Regulation.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 Ian Polter from England, for whom this was possibly the last Raiders Cup.
The eight-cup Raiders veteran, Serhio Garcia of Spain, became the tournament’s best player of all time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Normally I don't cry, but today I can't control my tears."
This was a difficult year.
I am thankful to Thomas that he raised me up and trusted me.
I am very, very happy that we got the cup back.
It is the merit of the team and I am happy to have been able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He then gives his name to his fellow countryman John Rama, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The pride I feel in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up following the course of this player," said the 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four games in France and currently has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Raiders Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find their chance, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furrick said after his team's disappointing performance: "I was proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we were able to put little pressure on the European team.
We were fighting.
All the best to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players finished a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the U.S. Raiders Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to put on your hats.
We won."
