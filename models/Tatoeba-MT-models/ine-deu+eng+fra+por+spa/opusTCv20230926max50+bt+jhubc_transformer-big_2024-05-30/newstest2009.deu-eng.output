The Prague Stock Exchange is plunging into minus against business closure.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of normal day-to-day trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange tied immediately at the start of Tuesday's trades to Monday's burglary, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, it was the Wall Street robbery.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s reaction to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote, which refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks on Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points over the business day, but was able to offset some of the losses later, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while Shanghai’s markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index.
“The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong move at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the draft to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the breach.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion) should be spent.
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell nearly seven percent, a similar decline it had last seen in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little sign that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress admits U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks about adopting a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Members of Congress have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system is being negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various reports, the plan could probably be voted on on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a communication that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "nourishment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as one could help the markets in practice as well.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package should look like to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This entails the purchase of unselling mortgage assets from financial corporations, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re on target,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also hitting sharply in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress before Sunday.
The aim is to reassure investors about trades in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a Congressional decision could affect trades on Monday.
But it is not yet clear when both chambers of Congress will vote on the law, and there is uncertainty as to whether the last-minute negotiations could still fail on a problem.
The legislature hopes that it will be adopted in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo some changes.
The total amount allocated to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, with another $ 100 billion and later the final $ 350 billion.
Bush positively appraises progress in negotiations
While the president has a veto power in this decision, Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, has remained, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciates the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the leading trader, said the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also restricts the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
It is headed by the Treasury Department.
“We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who are having trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys, the goal being to lower the monthly cost to debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
“It is much more important that the members of Congress agree to support the plan and that they pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be an adoption is the most important thing at this point," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer Schneide: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still phone.
So, of course, it looks like it’s better to just buy a phone.
After all, there are plenty of reasons why you should buy a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Surely you can hardly buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on the go, that is, with compressed music, in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eighteen thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably hardly get headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even make a hint.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better one, a worse camera, and maybe also can navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, Music Players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones that they won’t be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you still make calls from time to time, you’d better buy an office charger for safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one time charging out.
Another problem is when you want to overplay the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB connector, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can be done without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
Players do not require special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players create a music library themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address book, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire especially about the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the ease of operation.
Is music especially for you, and you listen to it every day just briefly, for example, in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
This is something that almost any phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a phone or player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is lying at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the ease of operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequent horrific bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a suitable card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But be careful.
For the basic models, as a rule, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you will not need to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is similar to that of a single MP3 player.
The most widespread here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will allow you MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Might be.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting for long.
The fact that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe has been reported on Mobil.cz many times.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the latest steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming fees, there is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices so high in the Czech Republic compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a statement of battle.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to scoff at the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has often stated in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often owes this.
It’s probably true that a classic provider with their own network doesn’t have a lot of chances anymore (by the way, they probably wouldn’t even find frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market that led to a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators had to react.
Even before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market in the UK, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
You don’t have to look for examples for a long time.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country’s fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual vendors need far fewer customers than a classic vendor.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-clic target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also take hold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators say
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking is more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
Her interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in providing our customers not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from Telefónica O2's press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "Until now, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build."
And she adds: “T-Mobile’s network will hardly have a virtual provider by the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone is focusing more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers in hand
The actions of the mobile operators are easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should it be easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something is also evidenced by the long run around the creation of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was exerted by T-Mobile when U:fon entered the market.
This is also evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument for why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment in the mobile telecom market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile telecom provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
However, in view of this approach of the mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulators is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, referred to his very typical attitude to the whole problem.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in his reply to our inquiry.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
This is more than suspicious of an authority that represents the interests of consumers and, among other things, is to ensure that no one abuses its position in the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, it is likely that pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is really shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely identical gasoline price at the gas stations, it is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not found in this case any indication of anti-competitive action and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably lacking in the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, after telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators holds a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - for a virtual provider to enter the market, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider has, logically, the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
In the telecommunications services, the devolution of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted novelty of the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the competences of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not succeeded, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms that we will then deal with, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the respective company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be talked about by the responsible mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, they can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
In fact, the activity of these companies generates non-negligible profits, while at the same time - unlike the actual virtual providers - they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it like the normal customers of the mobile carriers."
That alone, however, should at least seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Do the mobile providers close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers, they would not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has already stressed on several occasions, the entry of virtual providers into the market led to a significant price decline in the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely in these moments that the regulators intervened, which in no way tried to safeguard the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But we don't throw the shotgun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And then the Czechs will finally not phone more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood in a festive hour.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choir composition and in an instrumental version.
The lyrics were taken over by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at the same time.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier, he had told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both of them and then with the choir, so that the text is well understood, so that a harmony is created," said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music originated from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first strophe of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like?
The Prague transport companies will also transport a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers to enter a subway, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
Currently, about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card can buy them.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it recorded on their chip card at the information centres and branch offices of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Koby<0xC5><0x88>ky, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozty<0xC4><0x8D>e.
The coupons have also been available on the Internet since yesterday on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travelers also have a desk with trained staff that advises interested parties when buying online and also records the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-service vending machines on the opencard, which are installed in some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket devaluing, the passengers may have already noticed them in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
A vending machine controls the coupon instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines that will work from tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the coupon you previously purchased plays itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region Mittelböhmen arrive in the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, the train attendants have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, which compiles the timetables for the Prague transport operators.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout with the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the opencard must be placed at a marked point on the side of the checkout.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not use suburban buses and does not know when the coupon expires can go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
The information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudanese demanded a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans had asked the United States in 1945 for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest.
This is evidenced by a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the US president in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the American president not to allow the return of the "South Gauss" - which was seized by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads.
Since the accession of the Sudeten Germans to Czechoslovakia, in the knowledge of the Czech national character, suggests that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States, for today and forever, to protect him.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area, you are acknowledging a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president has doubts about the mindset of the Bohemian Wald Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Bohemian Waldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or wanted to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, it draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Bohemian Germans had to at least assume that they would negotiate their expulsion from the Republic, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a budweiser German in the Baltic Sea navy.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An Emotional Campaign for Drivers
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
This could also be characterized by the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to dissuade drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take drivers away from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember that they dressed before the ride.
The campaign aims to focus on young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional motorists.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a badge.
And then in a bloodsucker, there's the word "pay."
This should mean that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic footage of accident victims.
It is promising that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar loaf and whip for motorists
"For drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whipping.
Sugar bread means that when you drive at red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Already less effective are, in his opinion, boards that draw the driver’s attention to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon dissipate with the environment, and the drivers will not notice it anymore," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if in return we can make peace with Palestine and Syria.
This he emphasized in an interview published on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the occupied territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to hand over a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, citing two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens of people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians know just too well what they have to give up in order to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shia) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they have for the terrorism of the (Shia) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Qaeda and the jihad (the holy war)".
Question after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to go around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers are allowed to walk on and off the bus while driving.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward would be contrary to the law on road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, even though she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward is carrying coffee or newspapers.
It also matters whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no parking spaces, which the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and at first this did not agree to the movement of travelers.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we have reached a consensus that travelers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law doesn't know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward – no law describes that role.
However, there is also no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic knows only the concept of vehicle attendants; however, it does not define its rights and obligations," added the spokesman of the Hanzelka ministry.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus also has parking spaces in the product approval.
That’s all,” he stressed.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with parking spaces and a higher permissible speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, the expert says
BESIP road safety specialist Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards aboard a bus.
"With a fluid driving pattern, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump her head."
"But if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations,” he says, and also believes that this issue is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this capacity.
Even after the accident, the director does not see his profession as risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards on his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends up with some fatal accident,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz not quite a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was accidented, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand strip without blinking and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
The fact that the two seats were sold to the stewards is disputed by Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transportation has already been working for over a year.
“But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the score system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says specialist Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses falling within the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the House staff.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board of directors wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
The WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia has recently made clear, the time is pressing for a future solution.
However, for some time now, there has been talk of a kind of connection between the deca bank, which savings banks know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas, when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is held in half by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has mandated the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, according to the Financial Times, have only just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees among the most important employers at Finanzplatz Frankfurt, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came of this trinity.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's involvement.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about a connection of the deca bank with state banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Helaba’s chairman of the board, had spoken out against planning games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to be ripe that a merger of the various houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now that the parliamentary elections in Bavaria are over, the first link between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be closer.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
Should the pressure increase to further mergers, the partners gradually assume that they will.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A merger with West LB, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put forward a lock at the beginning of the year.
Let's go to North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the board of directors there, it is also mentioned that there will certainly be a "comprehensive solution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the merging of individual units with the deca bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it’s the first time, for Luca, it’s the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded man and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a hug first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the station Puorta Nuova, on this evening at 23.45 hours start four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected 6.30 hours.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one bus travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing beside their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, that’s nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur cement lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
Overnight, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The journey, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian cleanliness, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide costs 75 euros - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the highway direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
It will quickly be quiet in the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It will be held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates on the highway 8 just outside Munich will once again pause.
Finally, when Marcos’ group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 7:30 in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco delivers a final address, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reisebüro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors to the beer tent go up, it's called running!", Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, Marco yells, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
“We’re showing the security people that we’re behaving well.
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone."
Thirdly, "Tonight I'm going to come back here at eleven and a half." Understood?
And then there's the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds the trees, signs and even the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party as a waymark.
They want to be armed for retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; the talk is of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived this weekend extra from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which runs a national statistic in which the Italians take first place before the British (about 60 deployments) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular among Italians is the Hofbrüizelt.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also insisted that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis developments.
Because it has now occurred on the weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term – which is no longer possible because of the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year, income from attributions to claims and certain securities as well as from the resolution of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher returns from reimbursements of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and from the business supply for group companies, the yield was still moderate at around 16 percent.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financer had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been split up into Aareal Bank.
Due to insufficient earnings in classical public financing, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public-partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is said to be quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
By 2007, it had already been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a significant state and infrastructure funder since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely failing as the banks are shrinking their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros – annually.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered with the loan for the foreseeable future, and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely malfunctioning international money markets.”
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and unpredictability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be used in full.
But also the opposite is not to wear out.
After hearing about the bank’s bankruptcy late Sunday evening, even the at least preliminary rescue could not calm the minds.
The stock price drops by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are quite good.
While the priority debts are barely moving, the prices of subordinated bonds are more consistent.
The most affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo-real estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp exacerbation of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only gotten into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely payment of pensions can be assumed.
Or it’s happening what hardly anyone at the moment dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that overlap with the partial nationalisation, the probability bordering on security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors for some sleepless nights with the decision to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can, after all, use a closing line to form a loss claim for future repayment tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, presents herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Before I went to school, I had a bump.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and ride 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, thankfully I didn’t miss it.
The beginning of classes at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o’clock, the pupils rumble in until a short meeting with the teacher, the ‘home room’, begins at twenty-nine o’clock.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, nor in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, plus a blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all chirped, chirped and groaned and constantly I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly got to my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really assaulted.
Everyone was talking and laughing and asking me about holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - that is something different from the fateful German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
I usually don’t have a pale shimmer, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look odd and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then prepares especially skillfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this too.
‘Why Japan?’, my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
“Because it fascinates me.”
I’ve been reading my favorite manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was completely clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And this is something that is highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or a cockroach flee in danger mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
For several years, the Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing articles by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut questions of sensation or of consciousness in general, we enter rugged terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists conclude is a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research poses us with great problems.
Most of my presentations relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly in the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, one relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What happens to the sensations?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activity-conscious brains.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and, in particular, humans.
Associated with the linguistic nature, there are fine gradations of sensation, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio believes, for example, that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-emotion regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
Theoretically, I can’t deny it, but I think it’s unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees when in danger, even if she feels fear?
In my eyes, mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove similarity of experience.
While the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is signaled here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I do not study language and consciousness in rats, nor do I explore sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think of it as short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a testament to its confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
It is possible that even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Association, Grigori Surkis.
"Uefa will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from this."
Several first-teamers had been sentenced to compulsory descent for manipulation alone last season, eventually even the start of the league had to be postponed shortly.
Dennis Quaid is back.
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with ex-Hollywood star Meg Ryan outlawed her goddamn Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams – and strikes back.
Delayed Rose War with ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have a nasty fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said: “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud was only known to them after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “Be it monstrous,” said the 54-year-old of the New York Daily News, “Meg repeatedly chews and re-tightens the history of our relationship.”
It is also “deplorable” that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
And so his admissions end with the side thrust: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family who is doing well.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50% cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already been cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate as a reason for this, which has led to a “decreasing travel craving of American tourists.”
Financial venues such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the drop in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In terms of airfares, the trend in the first quarter was still upwards:
Due to the increase in fuel consumption, travelers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1% more than in 2007, while long-haul flights that were fuel-intensive became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices were even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse is, on the one hand, the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is falling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, puts increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the abolition of unprofitable routes on airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the leaderboard.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarged break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew that he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the booth of the Hamburg Arena.
A lot was going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similar: Here with goal two!
Implementation was delayed.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more relaxed.
The 1:0 (1:0) is due to Mladen Petric's 11th header; and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flashboard on the video wall, which showed their club as a class premiere.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate testimonial stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late-committed entries - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen, who was retired by FC Bayern - is slow, but still unable to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling," Jol said.
After the Voting Defeat
On Wall Street, there is fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break by 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in a day in its history.
Later, the Dow started again.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus 10,579 counters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell by nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had been involved in the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds will be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
The amount is to be paid out, but not in a single stroke, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock options from financial corporations, which could be redeemed if price developments were appropriate, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the US downwards
The multi-billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not solve the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German major bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and the Dax is plunging downwards.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have brought the Deutsche Aktienindex (Dax) down to a low.
The share of the Munich real estate financer lost three-quarters of its value temporarily despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark, scoring a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets around the world fell to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei leader index fell by 1.26% after initial gains to 11,743.61 counters.

In the MDax, Arcandor shares declined after announcing a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter Affects Flight from Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused inconvenience: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, you are now at risk of cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised for years is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes will unexpectedly be faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"The cause of the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is apparently a force of attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is to say, it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
After all, according to scientists, dark matter accounts for well over a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of her kidnappers, the tourists brought to Egypt will be free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hostages were reportedly killed in a pre-release shooting.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been abducted.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists fleeing into the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV station Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently checking their health status,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
It remains unclear the background of a shooting before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was “only about taking the hostages,” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly imprisoned his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was harassed by abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "abandoned her life".
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended with, "I used to tie her up and connect her eyes."
"I didn't sexually coerce them.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the impact, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her action over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for data loss are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was fired from the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "They thought it would be dealt with internally by the Department of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be mentioned, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret location.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could face costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million following the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s deposits to 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The director general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans expire.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that every company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies must obtain <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
“We will be observing all aspects of this matter over the coming weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are non-shareholder organizations on both sides, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per liter
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations were conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court denied bail on charges of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-backed transitional government to first grant her unrestricted freedom.
Correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear as part of her release whether she will be able to continue on foot when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted bail as she is already on probation abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers file that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week carried out a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its appeal against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its shareholding in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyBs’ share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the shareholding in ITV raised doubts about ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office of Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney General's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Mediator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal prosecution, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. Attorneys from office in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed because of poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of electoral fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been shot because of the dismissals and ultimately resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General criticized in particular the role of Gonzales by bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "abandoning" his leadership role and showing himself "extremely disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music awards ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold award next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards, having come into the narrower selection in four categories.
Q Magazine editor-in-chief Paul Rees said there were some songs that went beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years, one of which was surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute pharyngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
However, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active road.
There are also no street signs.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the longtime neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the municipal council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company’s purchase of the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district officials in the City Council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would re-pave the small street and re-establish seats, which are designed for a café to which the company would like to lease space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of rubbish, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinct City"), has published part of the city's story about Extra Place, which appeared in the 1952 magazine "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow alleyway that stays dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rainstorms.”
With few exceptions, the street looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street might be slightly polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in California Studies and Senior Director of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Not As Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice.”
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students” — which is true.
To close this gap in performance, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who are learning English first.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school benefits.
Take for example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one-third of students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth graders passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Surprisingly, 93% of the children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success was achieved by methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school is practicing the approach followed by education in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly the point that Obama should pay attention to, according to the head of the school Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in professional teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have been a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would be able to enter the classroom and not recognize him anymore.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national non-formal associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, “You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the gap in performance, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling due to renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil futures trades on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7% in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by both financial turmoil on Wall Street and violent storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they have fallen to almost $90 per barrel this month, and then rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Investors have already shown concern again on Monday, despite congressional officials announcing they had agreed on a bailout plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the penultimate chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it has apparently failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a message to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the commodity markets will also be affected.
“From a commodity market perspective, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
Analysts at the bank have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all after climbing up in the Jets jersey more often than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphant move.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sluggish game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one sliding out as an outfielder and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
“I didn’t put a lot of effort into it,” Coles says of the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has been voted on, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Cole were playing catches, defense quarterback Kurt Warner broke up.
Outfielder Darrelle Revis picked up an unsuccessful throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
Responding to both, as the jets scored 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rugged Gevrselassie breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why he is considered by some to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2-kilometer track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous score from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title on every distance from one kilometer to the marathon or set a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that air pollution might exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after the break and did not return rusted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and I still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized—particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa—for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records for the race.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the track in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers dropped.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year, showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injury, however, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners tear out first, but overtaking it after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden among the hustle and bustle of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet pitches, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that describes it – and that made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project during the depression – is in many ways a place of a very special sort.
Eatonville is as independent, prosperous, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city dweller and community member of the city's oldest church.
It has to be voted."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country’s average.
It is, on the one hand, a fortress of literature and, on the other, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so rightly did the concerns about Eatonville's image actually begin with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in oral form, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through Florida’s often-forgotten center, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-and-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, although he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and what-always-fits-hour rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls, who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual hints.
She added: "Some people don't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came brewed in the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something on her venerable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But “she never stayed too long,” he added as he swinged in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were stolen.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in the grand style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a 2003 biography about Hurston.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting out," Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration, calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "offensive rather than respectful of my race."
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being hugged—I remember—you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be sustained so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors, and artists who pushed themselves beyond prejudice, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out on her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-loved Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, making it once again part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway animated the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, aroused real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
More and more train travelers came, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was inscribed on the nationwide historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things – such as the mural of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field – are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community is misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better, and as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, which he believes may need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Kenon said on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York we speak fluent financial latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newsstands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst horror work day every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push the metal tea scales along sidewalks with loud clapping and transport trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still wandering between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bag at the food stalls on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account because of all the world’s downfall.
Although I had decided to put my duty on time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase roots branch, there were already about 20 people standing in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license", stood for the same reason as me snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, to places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (similar to a construction fund), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and silently bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went over bankruptcy management and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings assets, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and store employees who were standing in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered to be a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most bailout purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have acquired fluent financial latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my native Chinese supermarket took so much familiarity with reference to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt and their slim-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were slandering a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block of flats, got away with our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more risks."
Moslem graves dishonored during right-wing sliding in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, painted with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of burial at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at which the far-right parties recorded significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves at the Traun cemetery near Linz were severely damaged in a police-organized action on Friday night.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials believe this is an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the news of the burial, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan nears its end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received nearly 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral speeches were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his dislike of food commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say the far right is the country’s most politically strong bloc, suggest that this new development is based on young voters worrying about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter's Travel Barrier
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges placed Glitter under a six-month lockdown after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a restraining order last Thursday after they presented evidence of Glitter’s convictions for sexual abuse of children to judges.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford County Courthouse in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning law firm.
A spokesman for the court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police at the Ashford District Court applied for permission to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present.”
As required by the Register of Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “Police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is the overriding concern of the Kent police to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that could exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport check and he flew after some time to and from Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge County Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter has been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
Personality on the other hand
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the force of expression of the hands that are concerned because they cannot enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of the photography of flamenco, "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day," explains the artist, making it clear that "Flamenco-people" "can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer does not notice that they are typographic images.
Very ordinary people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not need to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera."
Inspired by the festival ‘Cante de las Minas’, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images reminiscent of classical photography were created.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the peasant understands flamenco: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essence, for something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and has been the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous Flamenco personalities including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as ‘portraits of veterans of sport’ (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer likes to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities that you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of portraits of the flamenco of today entitled ‘Flamenco-people’ is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he’s writing is “a madness.”
He still does not know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo and moved to the Amazon region for twenty years.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is “a madness” and “everything indicates that he should not write the novel”.
<0x60>If I had been wise, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point', so he ended his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people in the world.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival’s premium and gave his voice to most attendees, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who had a wonderful memory and a great sense of humour, but did not have enough time to go through it all again: how his vocation to literature arose out of an extraordinary way.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and how to know if books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', Vargas Llosa emphasized that 'there is no way' to tell one another.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfighting feasts fell out partly.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the party was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival of the volatile weather was postponed, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring arena.
There was only a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante struck two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had accomplished more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Julio, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second fight with buh shouts.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers urged the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they wouldn’t have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police chased them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Basque State Interior Ministry.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route check, the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to evade control.
The police started the chase until after a few kilometers the car stopped at the edge of the strip, and the drivers got out of the car to flee through a country road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later sent to other police stations for precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was ‘double’ so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the vehicle documents, which is why an additional arrest was made for falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation in order to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness watched as she tried in a rather strange way to get out of her parking space in Montecito, a California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “squeezed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the one who alerted the emergency service because she was 'fearful of locklears'.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, blocking traffic.
“They seemed to be unorientated,” so they took the policemen to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. <0x60>The first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' according to the spokesperson.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined, and placed in a local investigative detention at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and member of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to hear the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sports of the city hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of family
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for it," Llamazares pointed out what the party must do to the one who is currently sitting as a city councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for <0x60>transparency' in the possible investigations of violations of the rules that Silva could have started: <0x60>The VL always insisted that such cases receive the maximum transparency'.
Regarding this issue, he stressed that education has a “strict code of ethics for all public offices”.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Hero's Book by Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’ “Episodios Nacionales”, José Luis Carci presents in “Sangre de mayo” the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros invested in the filmmaking.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to ‘represent a lot of personalities and social analysis’, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of actors.
With a film length of more than two and a half hours, <0x60>Sangre de mayo' will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this filming, his <0x60>dream of childhood' came to pass. This is what he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film on the second centenary celebration of the bass on the 2nd of November.
The total contribution of 15 million, set by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, offers Garci, as he added, the "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" with the help of decorations and corresponding garments the image of the "confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people were forced to stand in the fight for independence and under the rule of the VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to expect funding, as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci did not collaborate almost all of his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a empezar', helped Kinci through his usual way of working: he put himself on stage to the actors with whom one must first rehearsal before starting to shoot and for those who had not done casting, he appeared in the <0x60>degrading and humiliating' part of the film.
Many actors he encounters in Sangre de mayo have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo' nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar ciliés' nor <0x60>siete mesas de billar ciliés' nor the film
Garci is not expecting any awards for this film.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s just for the sake of prosperity, and now you’re happy if you’ve produced another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.
“We’re not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance skills have helped me a lot in flamenco.
The dance of the butterfly, for example, seemed to me like Guajira, or the dance of the snake, like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area," she says.
The production features two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
<0x60>Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to contribute to my work, and I feel very honored.”
The staging also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he <0x60>loved the role of Di'vas, who took over the role.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain era and whose works no longer exist and therefore she is even less appreciated,” Bayón said.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, in order to achieve the <0x60>triennium of the <0x60>Triennium of the Andalusian Council of the Year 2006.
Thus, the <0x60>triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded internationally with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition <0x60>Juan Ramón Jiménez was now reached in that chopo de luz' and in the <0x60>Congress of New York.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, with the aim of making the person and work of the Andalusian world poet known.
The U.S. can not imagine without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in Sensation Reporter, and from the then-ruling notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman with his enthusiasm and followed her.
Look at how much it cost him to win the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
But it was a big blow for everyone.
"What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I've lost a great friend," Robert Redford said, crying, "my life and my country were the greatest inconveniences of his life."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the 'father' of cinema and the homeland, he died at a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and market collapse reigns, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If there are only a few people left who can be admired in this hard time without virtue, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country where it cost him a lot of effort to thrive against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement suggests taking home high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationalities.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
English film director and Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes said working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all has left us,” George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who now dare to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of integrity, to lead a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone who’s trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married fifty years later to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal to, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillets at home?” he joked.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he wasn’t as proud of any of them as he was of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
The streets of Madrid are inadequate for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for that?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is not true!
It was called the perfect street, and in my judgment, it was the worst street with everything around it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the assessment and I could review it, clearly something like this would not have passed.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket hole that allows you to be the first to go.
It doesn’t seem to be bad either, but if they let you go ahead, then they should also give you everything (including chips to avoid traffic jams on the street).
Well, I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is just to go there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense, because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So well, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to pick up the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Eventually, as expected, the road started and we hadn’t left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would have been harder to get them back.
In addition, in those 40 minutes of waiting it looked like rain, so it was tempted to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never come to mind.
So I think we’ll be dreaming of a city that’s well prepared for the Olympics for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human-interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which however is able to perform some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a system planner to the camp).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also organize the attendees into groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video <0x60>the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that conducts the conversation with her, and that she is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and replies that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many built-in programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, rather than filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a finding, considering that Microsoft added some feature and <0x60>Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Skillfully, many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
Yeah, that's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'windows' area.
What is the use of half of the applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, less exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the rest rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshment drinks machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will appear not at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso planted it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
If we start to list the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it <0x60>tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called <0x60>Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the origin of the name is connected with sport and originated from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' excels all for its excellent cotton, for its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail at the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
However, it is a pity to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
‘I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate’
Her great appearance with her sister did not stop her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full of life's joy.
At the moment, the Sisters Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, relocating her residence there and also makes the presentation of the most important awards in fashion, which is sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, I also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intensive work time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dressed up, combining their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many commonalities.
Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s to sneak around in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
After all, everything is connected to each other, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
You've recently turned 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than ever, I feel better than 30 years old.
I think the woman gets ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was little and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I will be a mother because my body demands it, and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will bring great happiness to my child and raise him with a lot of love.
As far as the film art is concerned, keep an eye on the works you participated in and were shot last year.
That is exactly how it is and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that <0x60>La última hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization Women for a Better World and the clothes we're showing. I know that two garments from our collection for Mango have been auctioned the same N for the money Na.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her, and I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may be relegated due to the alcohol level will have to install the <0x60>Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties because of the alcohol level, installs this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk state. If he is drunk, then the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General’s Office. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he receives a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were reported more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol, returned to the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air, and prevents autostart when the driver has made an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration that is higher than allowed is detected.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish markets, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without <0x60>peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveling.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple coming off the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, since you can't take any people at the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, who give the ointment of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair worn by the wind, without ordinary peep-toes, may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official escort awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and internationally increase young fashion talent.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann No. 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest store is in London.
There have been so many events associated with the desire to thank fashion designer Valentino for presiding over the competition, all ending with a luxury dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother had recently died, broke apart. He has put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some of the jewels of Allah that were breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and has begle Di with the Valentino
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango House, greeted the guests and was such a knight that he ended up with the Baron of Rothschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the store and wore a pair of pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she made an excitement, kind of caught up and remembered the time
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who upon his arrival (with his own bed linens and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, so is life.
1001 Advice on Stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget our chaotic, fast-paced daily life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to get to relaxation. The book comes to the bookshops on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computers that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to disconnect from the working world.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents the entire list of options in the book that are tailored to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are suggested.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the time has come to sit on the couch, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be terrified, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (wetting bed at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem, which causes anxiety and occurs in this way.
We’ve said it’s a positive disorder, so it’s not being treated, whether it’s associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
So, choose calm play for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are awful and a little too wild.
Nervous children who are advised to relax can use relaxation methods to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep peacefully.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to maintain calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will pull him out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be frightened after a couple of phenomena, then it is recommended to seek advice or find out what the reason for the fear is the child has.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and can not think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams about and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäuser on the field is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the Yellow-Blacks took on numerous goal opportunities and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot was passing just at the corner, Illhäuser should easily dominate the game, and it was succeeded alternately first Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot, the defence of Denmark.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi pass at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive, with two torque chances initially won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood exactly right to take back a ball that had been resisted in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the ill-mannered goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, as a result of which his teammates had to continue playing in numbers inferior.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems for an illhaeusic elf, who retreated only a little to 'compact' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big chaos.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Brittany.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him “with a constructive spirit” and hoped that he would come up with “concrete proposals.”
The visit of the President is taking place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee set up by Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysee Palace David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused congestion of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le did not break.
The Quiberon Peninsula was demarcated by a lock.
Already on Monday, sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel of Sleeves, such as Sables d<0x60>Olonne, in Vendée, where the fish cutters did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique broke the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
“The strike will continue,” because “the fishermen will not give in at any point” and “the fishermen will not go to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes said goodbye to film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer delivers forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the imminent recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is keeping its forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider relinquishing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. monetary authority, is considering relinquishing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that came before it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of most of its businesses, beyond its international life insurance and retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
Assets that AIG may be separating from include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments.
With regard to these sales, no definitive decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly make the sales in order to repay the over 85 billion loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historic Paris of the session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue the banks, a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points were concerned, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdag index, mainly for technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index fell by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to rescue the banks, which should again allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, MPs refused to grant the funds he had asked for to Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture circulating that presents Congress as unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would be “too late.”
“If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further restrict credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, emphasizing the sense of utmost urgency, that “every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial firm” in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking operations by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favor of banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the analyst added.
The market for basic goods has grown considerably.
The revenues of the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and the revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama wins by points in first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this TV duel that should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, albeit quite remarkable, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his decline in polling five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published a poll on Saturday saying Obama is five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, that is, those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls with 39%, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop to put his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy at the forefront, while clearly underlining his opponent’s “naiveness” on these issues, which formed the focus of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican ads since yesterday.
Obama himself said that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and accurately, without being distracted.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, but Obama has already,” opposed a Democratic ad this weekend accusing Republicans of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama told 20,000 people who gathered in a running-out rain during an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'workers'.' The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which the Americans believe is most fit to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Having once again stressed that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations at Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a primary health insurance system, would make him more determined.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully evaded questions about the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
"Have you noticed that an election took place in Minsk?"
Youth and opposition protesters demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk’s marketplace to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator should resign’.
Some admit that they have not voted at all: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice,’ says a young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-distribution of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the countdown," Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties, said in a statement.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and for us it is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the electoral process, does not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout seems too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, namely those who are most likely to correspond to the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night descends again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the Blood That Became Safe Again
Hema-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent a recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces at the time set up a committee to develop a new system for managing blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Cancer, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conserving system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was daunting.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and through work in this area over the next few years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly stressing that by early 2008, almost 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that ‘trust is something extremely fragile’.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krebs and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is manifested by a degeneration of the brain, which is unweigering to.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was undoubtedly proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which enable the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor’s blood, rather than the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used previously.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting blood infected with HIV.
In other words, you have to distribute 12 million cans of blood before someone gets HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 cans of blood each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case to occur in which HIV was transmitted via a can of blood.
I believe that it is possible to feel comfortable nowadays when you receive a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says the head of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor uninterruptedly,” Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Québec must also provide adequate care in addition to a safe supply.
“Demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, which averages only 3% of Quebec’s eligible residents.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent are excluded from donating blood for a year.
With this 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only canned blood, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand per year.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this umbilical cord blood collection program as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal’s impact yesterday, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series in Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the first league elimination games of the USL.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday, Impact had brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit in the Minnesota rematch by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two goals and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six pre-season games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
"He's been fixing too much on it in the first half," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest is in the North.
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
'Moving the course of our last great border in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines..
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc. were rotated.
Large funds as during the election period.
Speaking to the press, the prime minister refused to rule out holding elections this fall, even though he said his schedule was very busy.
The “Plan Nord” is the fourth element of a “vision” that the prime minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a “new economic space” that provides for an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches lately, the opening of the North – the northern area at the 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North is “a gem with enormous potential,” but did not specify a date, investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some perspectives on what more could be done: mainly on water energy, on forests, but especially on the mining sector, favored by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest’s list, the North possesses ‘nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds’.
This <0x60>area twice the size of France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just in our vicinity, it’s in us,” he stressed, as to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the North, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that has been followed by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north,” he explained, speaking about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible throughout the year due to the melting of ice.
Against this new geopolitical backdrop, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Ungava Pecist MP) have already initiated discussions with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Soil Treasures) takes an important place, has taken over the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit,” but an opportunity to “create a common vision.”
Moreover, the development of the North will proceed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nord plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative, project, namely the program <0x60>Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stresses that it is scheduled for commissioning in 2012.
"It remains among us, but I intend to be there," he confided to his party members, which provoked those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly 2009, has in fact not yet excluded the possibility of holding an election this fall, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly due to a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, mainly from “constitutional goals” that were adopted without further ado: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the “specialty of Quebec” in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and that they have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan Nord were adopted with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy for the development of the North of Quebec introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would be much further today', Ms Marois judged along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a plan Nord by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea," party leader Sébastien Proulx said in a statement on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former “justice” minister (which is ironic) in the Harper cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a “shame” for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one of all the countries concerned that has not brought home its compatriot imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who goes down to a court parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult, after so many years of suffering, will surely be broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, that word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so nonsensical from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily abused, tortured and imprisoned, at the behest of a head of government who, to this day, is supported only by a minority (may he be wholly a minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation with a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this resignation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a slanderous lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, especially not in the case of libel complaints, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the process turns out, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics in these unequal struggles are, by the way, often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a consensual arrangement that mutates the opposite side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public.
In contrast to what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not by leaps and bounds.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had exposed its books and files and opened a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent testing teams could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice-President, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a snag (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which she no longer demands to use these).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the discovery of truth that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It utterly denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified complaint.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months is yet to be adopted by both chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: Better control of MPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the reimbursement of public funds spent, new disbursements to curb the number of houses held captive due to payment arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries of the companies supported by the number of executives.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Judd Gregg announced the good news after a two-day negotiating marathon yesterday, a few minutes after midnight.
“We have made great progress towards a deal that will be market-effective,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis,” she said.
“This is the basic point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, fearing the effect that a repeat failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, were more in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction about having to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on adding certain provisions to the agreement, especially those that would allow owners to keep their homes, and those that would affect the salaries of the executives of the state-saved companies.
“If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to be applauded for.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guidelines I have read [show] that this is a thing that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards using taxpayers’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt at agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in need should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed that they will escape the impasse.
In order to round off the viewpoint for everyone in Congress, an order has also been added that if the government makes losses with this program within five years, it can then raise new taxes to recover its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first amount of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by a re-vote by Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which bring him dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the seizure procedures in respect of the homes linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as to set deadlines for repayment and the repayments paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The plan’s developers would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
Yesterday, in fact, more votes were raised against this project, both by Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Financial Commission, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to pay the cash."
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, the leader of a group in Congress called “the skeptic’s caucus,” represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured and to carefully consider what path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe have once again received proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who has been in great trouble since she lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis to the United States due to the risky loans in real estate.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In order to compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are coming.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was just about to nationalise another bank that was in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with his charming smile?
Yes and no.
His delicacy, his sensitivity and his obvious talent may have kept him just as far away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in it was reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man’s second in the 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, even the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and hypersensitive star to the glamour of the show business, whose riddles you will never completely solve, disappear.
A decent man, in the pure sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans left film lovers in a mess this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of ever-changing American film art is passing with it.
Then again, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
There will be a much shorter memory (1990) that awakens to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, who was re-recorded after his death and which Newman correctly made known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
He's still there.
Throughout his life, epochs unite.
The youth know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as Pater of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle joined.
Unlike several movie legends who withdrew from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, while betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prestige, and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive performances.
It wasn’t always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, who had the roles for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or desperates, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slipping away and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of delicacy and sadness.
In the tide of honors over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is also a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was thought to be quite tasteless, although at first we still found it funny.
The profits from his sales, however, flowed to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shooting.
He left a letter with these sentences to his five daughters: ‘Your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & amp; Co.?
On October 8, negotiations in the criminal trial against Jáno’s arrest and his accomplices begin.
In particular, the defendant is accused of involvement in organized crime, grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal offences - including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the funds raised from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with false invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly flowed into the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private cash registers of individuals.
According to the investigating authorities, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the associations were also alleged to have failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were falsified.
The bill blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Platten, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested bills on consumption in order to later issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Budapest self-government.
These bills are said to have been largely manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "Exploration Tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the premises at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious form and content errors.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, according to the invoice, 130 guests stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters apparently had no limits when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the clients Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá, according to the prosecution authority, do not appear at all.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that the documents were fake when they were presented to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp".
And further: apart from form errors, it was also wrong that the company was supposed to have housed a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that could not accommodate as many people.
The meals were also mentioned on the bill, but the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The insensitive counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they are targeting exclusively offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which is also contrary to the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as was noted in the course of the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the company is charged instead of 25 only 15 percent VAT, in addition, the employees are issued exclusively machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake the “accounting teams” had made was that in one case they had stated “goods transport” as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor’s office said.
Other form errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as fakes.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors said that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "error" is that the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza have failed: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001) precisely when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that they did not have to pay the bills themselves.
Consciously Falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also reported to have cooperated with Zuschlag und Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is to fund the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, which, however, the parties concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly connected with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components for a total value of about HUF 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the cash investment company Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has acted as a buyer of these invoices.
The manager of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be served by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations Kubatov confessed to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and having cashed their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on the express wish of Iván Kubatov.
However, in reality, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, lacked orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the auction, such as Atlasz and Y-Generación.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have cashed 10% of the invoice amount as well as the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generación and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts have been used for other purposes.
To conceal this, they have submitted five fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these bills were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to make a confession about the procedure for counterfeiting, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already pledged to report everything comprehensively on several occasions, his confession is still pending.
The question remains therefore whether it is in his interest whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the majority of the damage incurred of HUF 50 million, and whether supplement is willing to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that supplement now plays the "offended" after his requests for mitigation of detention and house arrest were met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not compensated for them are on the loose, or at least under house arrest, supplementation remains denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Overdoing – Or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the wrong bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, do not want to be beaten and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play the lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the subjects' active brain regions were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to earn money, however, increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which overcoming the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted research to trace the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their contributions.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerge as winners of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis on one was on winning while the other was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the “against losing” group were willing to bet higher than those in the control or “winning” group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
This is because the behaviors observed at auctions so far have only been motivated by the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain, and vomiting.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine darkens, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Approximately 1 million people worldwide die each year from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult a GP at the first signs of unknown origin.
Timely detected, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banishing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, held in 2004 for the first time by patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic inflammation caused by viruses, its occurrence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts as a kind of "pain agent" that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent faith in God affects human pain, reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshock while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using brain scan technology, it was even proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university also participate.
During the experiment, the subjects were connected to a sparkling device on the left hand, which gave the electroshocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke some sort of religious trance among the faithful, while choosing da Vinci’s painting, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages during this time, while viewing either the religious or the other paintings.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were “concerned” and felt “peace and quiet.”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thought that similar effects could also be produced with other, strong-acting images, even among the atheists, you just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect would a Madonna picture of Leonardo or another similar painter have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that she is found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
Towards skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he makes it clear that they would overlook just the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in this world.”
Schmidt said Google was still at the beginning of information gathering after ten years of world-changing work.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What job really suits me?”, but software programs are still unable to do so because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search history and later resort to it, so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "recommendations", with which the system receives customized products and services based on the previous.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of a data abuse – “when you look at what I do” – some are concerned about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that is arousing fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the rebellion against the power that encounters rejection in many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent anti-pedophilia action in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of the pedophiles.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe in in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully sued the FBI: accordingly, Google can not be forced in the future to disclose information to the FBI on secret request.
(However, the federal government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but it has been retroactively deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, for two months.)
Google’s image remains controversial: Those who don’t like to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services, the company is whipping with the indignation due to the conservative companies.
However, the American “geek culture” present in many countries, uniting enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the Windows market leader, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for identification codes and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package appear to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet sharply - a relationship that has become the focus in recent years thanks in particular to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, that is, users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the scales are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage their profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, they can connect them through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: Looking at the party photos last night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has been pleased, or the employee is fired because in his blog he is only too honest to air his anger about the company management - one thing is certain: the term "private" is new.
Who leads an online life is what he reveals about himself - so in roughly one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even circumvent Google’s monopoly, may like to do so – such as with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google’s search engine, deliberately leaves no trace.
Not a few people do not intentionally register on community pages so that they are not found, but also Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can handle alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
Public opinion, however, is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the increasingly imported services not only provide software to others, but also Microsoft.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counter-polar: For example, the management of the company would have completely rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought that the multiple meals of the employees was too expensive.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could again shake a lot: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project "because of the fact that other companies are now taking on such a large problem"
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already supplying the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes terribly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double killer of <0xC3><0x93>zd in the elimination of traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to clear the tracks, Borsod police station spokesman said on Tuesday.
The young people were conscious, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having intentionally murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in <0xC3><0x96>zd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act with a long hand - this is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the one hundred percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have been bidding so far.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of the "second 9/11".
The global financial disaster we owe to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to follow his own party for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second September 11th.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the goat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, now, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, for example, the Geneva "day indicator".
While some states could still provide bailout packages to their bankrupt financial institutions, saving the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was paid out to weakening monetary institutions, recalls the Viennese "The Standard" and, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more realistic that, after the Americans, the European taxpayers now also have to grab a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which now sweeps over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the “rescuers” would not have to “wet” immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to establish in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers’ money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates Hummel’s flight
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was unveiled, in which Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummeln to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the autorobot-controlled BR23C biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval “private area” that is very similar to our own “shield,” said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers picked up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180 degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tyres at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it were not so, the autorobot could not react quickly enough to evade the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autorobot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is still considered unavoidable within the accidents at present.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they evade other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the evasion, unlike the bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and that is only in the direction of the tyre's swivelability.
While the bees here have infinite possibilities to evade other bees, the researchers could only use the rotational motion of the car robot, i.e. the acceleration and deceleration.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react to them accordingly.
It does not need to store these, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it continuously takes only a handful of KB of memory.
It does not require gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously guiding the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is a written version of the $700 billion heavy bailout package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local East Coast, members of Congress reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic president in the US House of Representatives, saying the agreement needed only to be made on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise reached on the bailout package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said that the program will be effective and efficient, but that more needs to be done, because according to Pelosi, it was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing down the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e., Washington time on Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is on its turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, lending-laden securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount will be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount will be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and over the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the President.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another Congressional decision.
In the sense of the law, the Treasury Department can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the competent officials of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both at an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury Department guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the damages to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as immediate assistance to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can count on the government to shorten their handling, which is called "Golden Handshake" in the Overseas Snake.
Wages will only be cut in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the retired bank chief is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers’ salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements, so that more people will participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers’ salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank are recovering.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers will recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan doesn’t protect taxpayers’ money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9%.
Export prices were 1.1% higher than in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% from the previous year’s prices.
Due to changes in domestic and export prices, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only slightly increased, i.e. by 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
Also, the selling prices of the manufacturing industry have risen only slightly - 0.1% - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 per cent) - mainly for bags and belts - the increase was 4.6 per cent, for shoes the prices went up by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly boosted prices for chemicals and production (1.6%).
Price declines in crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent) and wood processing (0.1 per cent) were slight.
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily due to the increase in gas prices introduced on July 1.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the fastest (32.4%).
In the metalworking sector, an increase of 13.2% was observed, while the increase in the manufacture of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11%.
A decline in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of the cost increase in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7% compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the asset sector (0.7 per cent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and processing sector they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8%) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
In the sectors manufacturing consumer goods, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, while in the investment goods, a price decrease of 1.4 percent was noted.
The industry’s export prices measured in Forint rose 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but declined by 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it grew by 7.5 per cent against the euro, even by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on January 12, as the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "it all depends now only on whether the electronic immigration or control system will be introduced overseas in a timely manner."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Merit Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with foreign policy advisers to Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain back bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the Secretary of the Treasury's resignation.
Congress and government officials announced on Sunday morning, after days of marathon consultations, that they had reached an agreement on the bank bailout.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents at leading the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s High, which gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We need to act now, responsibly (...) – your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat,” he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic vision as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time picking up on this (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of handling for top managers — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press show of the German-speaking space
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters have become more confident within the camp - so comments "Der Spiegel" on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution annihilates her fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - now modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the breakthrough is a problem of Christian democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come to an end, but something came to an end on Sunday, which, however, was quite exactly marked ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell to 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, still in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The CSU’s consistent modernization in the federal state has finally wiped out their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time greatly appreciated the pace, but without impact, the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and arbitrary.
It is noteworthy that in recent weeks the classic groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma.
In this case, the CSU’s support fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections in its article "Who with whom? party leaders reluctantly in coalition questions".
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP head as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have opted out of the bowl-molterer course.
A repeat of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally by the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> chief Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to take government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which will be hosted this year by the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, has begun.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a Fidesz member of the European People’s Party, drew attention, in particular, to educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that affects Roma children, and it is the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of Fidesz MEPs reports, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher education degree."
Mr Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which plays a key role in asserting other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
MEPs believe that it is important that a broader circle of people - i.e. Roma and non-Roma - become aware of these connections.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax, they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member has stated, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, and it is essential for this to comply correctly with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equality of opportunity and freedom of discrimination at the European level, but also at the national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling yet, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in office, the only question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic loss of 17 percent of votes will be decided on the last weekend of October at the Extraordinary Party Congress.
However, the much-sought-out duo already made it clear that they did not want to stick to their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the “Bavarian tsunami” demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of his career-highest Edmund Stoiber - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4% of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "lone-government" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
While the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party’s internal restructuring, potential successor to Huber, Vice President and Federal Agrarian Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which is conducting probe talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing “free voters” about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stubber appearance first took advantage of the Huber-Beckstein duo to then serve the goal-oriented politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role, calling the former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman "the bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU – in his opinion, the CSU deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to its success at the national level in 2005, is not re-established with a joint force act, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the September 2009 Bundestag elections.
Merkel, who has failed to hide her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and yet the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6%, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MPs managed to get into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-populated parliamentary state, although it has been coming out for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the opposite party assembled under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had already been elected to the polls in the 2006 polls, will vote for the polls and thanks to a constitutional amendment.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on the EU due to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. To alleviate the price increases, even loans were taken, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country, to the Russians. Against the background of the expectations of the opposition, therefore, the Ukrainian government has been in the betterment of the situation.
The OECD’s election evaluation report provided a temporary relaxation, focusing on the positive movements rather than the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of one-third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD quick report criticized the campaign already on Monday - according to which opposition parties are not expected to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system of the two regions: political prisoners have been put on the loose, and Minsk is ready even for minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to recognize the independence of the avowed Georgian provinces of South Ossetia, despite the refusal of Russia to form a state with the Abkhaz.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results, but rather tries to make clear to voters the need for economic reform.
"We are facing a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of selling stones, but still I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich in hinting that the only security service is not even one of the most supported by the pensioners.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" admonished to the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are swivel doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those sludge eggs that first stamp off and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
"Swivel doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,” Brunetta stresses once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the establishment in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, “the choice of the swivel doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no opposition on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by everyone, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissants.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announces that "within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people are present at work each year".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to work against the Brunetta Decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absences at work - so writes the Consumer Center - the people of the 'working lazy' are growing steadily.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree.”
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; so is the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, 2,500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto Nazionale Controgli Infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as are caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Labor Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati ed Invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outraged 'Basta' has arisen from this; understandable in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some whirlwind in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for more direct awareness in school settings by young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social gravity; we must put in place and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to end the problem".
"The data on occupational accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention, which is exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How to believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight it through different actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school.
"Further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and public opinion awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is required in the face of a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency".
Mercandelli also spoke of the "progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system, which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations decided from time to time by a legislature".
Mp3 player charged: danger of hearing loss
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csserri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
“From the report, it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day risk permanent hearing loss.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings - the EU says - show a clear risk that urges to act quickly.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information commonplace.
Given these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"Scientists confirm that they are too concerned and that the European Commission, together with other EU members and stakeholders, will now investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music equipment and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. Concerns about the damage that could come from excessive noise pollution.
These damages can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of noise exposure.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices only listen to loud music five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits applicable to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who cross this limit risk complete hearing loss within five years.
This is 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it is supposed to be over in March, the balance sheet will be drawn in June.
This is the process set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome", which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Thermes.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and represents all political, social and cultural views", stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, which will remain politically responsible to the city and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a time-defined endpoint.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work carried out by the Commission".
Whoever questions the Commission's competence because of the lack of its opinion on commitment, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to consider a longer period of time in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless facility nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think; it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a leap of quality – which it really needs – and thus take a common step towards the future”.
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only confine itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who is keen to be considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his choices, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations with antagonistic Islam (and still does this today as a private man).
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet site: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!”
However, in fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here a mentality of the United States emerges, which has been kept hidden until the last moment.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crunch, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to seize them.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weakness for the majority.
The one who will take his place faces a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists too: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nonetheless, they stated that the information concerning the competent authorities was not really concerned about the general credibility.
They don’t feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are due to the cuts that occur in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives of the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, executives are even at 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are making their way into the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” felt by journalists has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it will bring something good to journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors in chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for it.
56% of editors at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at the local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
Managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
In the case of journalists, it is 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editor") is always a topical topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations, and Internet operators, employers offer as they like it to them and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors receive very often very high salaries, while the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the real estate agent’s application, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the event of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor’s office had ruled) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already surfaced a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: A large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the run-up to the crisis has split the Republican party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives, who are “those in Washington” and the most hostile to the South and the financial world.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state combined with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means the decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This represents an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also a huge number of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into disrepair and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become increasingly serious, only the United States in the economic situation can save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two prerequisites not to be overestimated – under certain circumstances – that no international organization and no market will otherwise be able to rely on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a sector closely related to it: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now, when we were so convinced that we have long since entered a networked global realm, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the intangible, that we must at once determine how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While they can all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to the extreme by a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in an unproductive, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, presupposes a short delay.
Who says territory, who says government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of outrage over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a profoundly rich and, in a sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, a picture of inadvertentness, a feeling of distance, all of which are directed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large sections of the population is paving the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is increasingly foreign to the majority.
Thus, the demand for leadership is undermined by a branched but powerful movement of the disenfranchisement of the ruling class and the traditional political establishment. This is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the imminent upheaval of the collective state of mind in the United States.
You get the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today.
In the face of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses.”
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets walls go up
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which seems to have almost reached the target.
Applied on an area of only 2.5 sq.m., the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of stacks of spaghetti-arranged tubes," says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests conducted with different materials such as glass teflon and abrasive paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the resilience of the reptile's feet and at the same time "makes it easy to remove from the wall," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be used as a transient adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe so, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less intriguing benefit, such as connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the field of space.
For now, the superheroes will have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibres that, like hair, cleans itself of dust by moving on a surface and thus always retains a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed especially in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the body’s intake of these.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. As part of the 236. meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm: it is enough for a glass of health to become the patient's apple, orange, or grapefruit juice destined to be more nutritious.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthma drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
In a report two years ago, the same drug agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture, stressing to be careful what is consumed in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or methadone.
It’s not just grapefruit – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, said: “Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there is still uncertainty, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s biggest critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial to the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received no little controversy as a response and was presented to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is a “great-valued economist” but also a benchmarker with a “very aggressive style, especially against the Bush administration’s excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now Spartan designed starter menu, now is finally a new format guaranteed on the ground, i.e. the newest format given to Apple's operating system Mac OS x, the newest version achieved (support for Mac OS x).
Eight against was also on compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send them via email, for example, including the ability to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
For example, "hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extends the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most highly improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited in multiple hands by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a phrase to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to release various features of OpenOffice on the web (on the cloud), while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if the cost-freeness can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed the big shot: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more familiar access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Cabbage tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third ranked and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Gerolsteiner is the fourth rider to be tested positive for Cera, the third-generation epoch, which has already happened with the Italians Riccardo Riccco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories in recent weeks.
If the rehearsals now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epoch test, and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: Is ITALY RACIST?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with opposition.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young, Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the League of the North is recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just that.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and for the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism.
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious turns. Entire groups of students are losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level" – says the Sunia leader, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the high demand on the part of the students has led to a deformation of the market.
In addition, most rental offers involve a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary measures, which will lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan, a sleeping capacity in the Brianza district is needed for around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, there are 250/280 euros for a bed of necessity, 370 to 500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighbourhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rentals in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge outside districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bed, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% above average are demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the single-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
Most of the places affected are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have traveled a piece of street full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It is always the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which is lost to life.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the huge number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these ticks paid for the most of the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also emerging, but first of all is the preservation of the already existing, because when a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are ready to look for an old multiplex cinema on the peripheral.
And here the lack of state for the fund of the trade union remains an external consideration: the debt burden recorded by the state amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
To sustain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be of need".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of fears about the old cinema halls, decided to protect it by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas as well as the ones in the historical center.
The measures envisaged include tax preferences for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the Centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a delightful initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to counteract the superpower of multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of Baghiera’s “Supercinema”, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the “Nuovo cinema Paradiso”, even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations made by the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Attorney’s Office against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Also handcuffed was Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time for a sum of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"This has made it possible for the mafia group to officially enter the town halls and determine the policy of the public administration," the judges said.
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he testified had invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3 project.
From an eavesdropping action in connection with the investigation into the Dal Torrione case, there has been a willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making the public administration’s actions identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy flows from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up.
It is a non-extinguishing source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now do the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now focusing on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is weighing the possibility of working with us.”
This is about acquiring an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that the United States continues to produce oil in Alaska, and President Bush recently set in motion plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, then observers speak of an increasing interest.
Still technologies worthy of improvement.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland have been rather small in size and do not seem to be causing serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected bows.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the bogies up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only awaiting state approval, and some of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Generation Research, the potential that lies in the tides is of particular interest at the moment.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
