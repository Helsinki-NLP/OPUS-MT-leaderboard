Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph concerning the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
MEPs rejected in second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former prime minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court must rule on the convicted woman's appeal in December.
Tymosenko called the regime's political revenge verdict and provoked a process of suspicion of the court's bias in the west as well.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan defeat
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but these are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a theft one cuts off his hand.
Women can forget emancipation, any disrespectful of their faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Qur’an that will unite, instead of the personality of the dictator, the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot imagine and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best, and would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that Islamist warriors have accepted the help of infidel dogs with appreciation.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So there is no problem for locals to get rid of "cruises".
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to boast of a disinterested protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these Sharia adherents from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published the GDP information for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market broke all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have published their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is projected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (increase of 0.3% over the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The yields of the bonds of Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Returns on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the ultimate guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football team has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Czech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also dearly defended with good luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech team also won thanks to super Czech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification for the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure even in the second part due to a precise Czech defense.
The victories of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech team will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and in addition a prize of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams struggled to assemble combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not break through the Czech defense, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the deaths of the US and Israel.
Hundreds of students from universities in Isfahan created a human shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's null agenda at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the deaths of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren have an above-average weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This once again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns that surround him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, sausages are found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of young adults, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case with most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 pupils from sixth to third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, or even obese, children is the absence of proper nutrition and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed indicated, for example, eating breakfast five times a day – in case of lunch – snacking – dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” one of the results of the survey said.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, each person eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been found is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children are more likely to consume unhealthy fries.
Almost every student – not to mention weight – drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of children surveyed do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diets based on the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a high preference for sugary lemonades," the study said.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"In a control of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the awareness session 'Obesity is not a coincidence', there was a strong desire to move towards a healthy diet," the survey results indicate.
The most striking was, for example, when it came to sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour balls or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dressing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it's gonna be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it’s really “drunk”.
This time we have with Director Alenka (at the moment there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically extend wide arms, lengthen a neck or add the necessary curves.
We have thus come to nicely emphasize the character and also not to dress too eye-catching types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all,it is worth getting it done on-demand.
And you will not regret it because the clothes that fall flawlessly are invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that glides constantly, winds up and does not hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style outfit, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that considering what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know about the Victoria's Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not dress only physically but creates, for example, the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, entertained us with all this.
But that,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday’s session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with only one outfit differently.
For this example, variability is paramount.
Like for example this trench coat that should be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with shoes and take a photo as a dress.
Or just raise your sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it," he pointed out.
But I especially liked the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to counteract it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we strive to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (thus a dozen models) I have to be ready to "cut" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success to us has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists remains frivolous.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to pass to the second rank).
And if someone does a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than what he actually has.
We then only need to navigate on Google and make sure if the boulevard information indicates the celebrity in question, if it has leaned or thickened etc...
Honza and Mario put us on the heart Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient themselves in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can't throw everything away and tell her, 'My God, what a horror.'"
"You'll find some things that you'll find pretty and him that you'll advise with what to wear them," Mario says.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for depilation or feeding pins, there is also nylon yarn (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one can close a garment in the back, if it's not too big they can be used (they are too big).
So that we are not only people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, fortuitously outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
Therefore, we really need skills.
Mario was delighted when he congratulated me for my creation.
The account I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course.
I’m beginning to understand more and more that styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run is disputed throughout America.
Revision
Originally a hassle-free race is transformed due to a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it in a routine morning trip to work.
It fulfills everyone’s ambition to some extent, but it’s useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set pulls down due to some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the planned stages in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are quite nice, even if the graphical technical level is the same as the previous series.
After all, this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumnal landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasant.
The tests are in addition from time to time embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classical duel with the chronometer) and then another duel awaits you with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
Rather, it’s an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help them by tapping on the right button at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
What’s surprising is that there are fewer moments like this than you expect (to be specific, there are only three).
The result is like this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the gameplay.
The pattern of behavior is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is currently nothing extraordinary, but it cannot be said to be negative.
When it comes to realistic simulation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet in place.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During tight overtakings, you sometimes touch each other slightly, but otherwise your car is in a frenzy.
Or it ends up in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really upsets you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken your figure or you have come out in the set the game takes you back at the time of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have 5 restarts.
Once you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool, in case something is not going well, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes reboots don't help and you have to find the solution by remembering the itinerary in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain corners that you have to go through in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise, you will encounter in a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute late.
What annoys you are the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand aside and contour them or brake.
It does not matter if you go in front of him because it is "calculated"in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides your view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a lot of times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and adrenaline-filled, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it is a pity because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You have to be careful about gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, U.S. highways for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic surroundings on highly technical drives such as lace roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are racing in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that are added to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This connects online with the Autolog feature which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other features in the community.
One of the most difficult shots to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (looks like it) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (looks like it).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you is a subway raft that sends the car directly to the garbage.
At the editorial we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What bothers me is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is a choice.
In order to please the largest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare for the mistakes to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically abolished the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at Charles University Law School could envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto "understandable and open about Europe" very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms resonated that he is fade, that he's a leatherback, that he can't fulfill any mission and I have to say he's cut everyone's breath because he keeps his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "To what phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the Union's policy towards states, as well as China or China.
Nobody wants to ban us our syrecky (cooked dough cheese that smells very strong)
Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or they have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has reached its peak" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be slim and with a view to savings, which branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be solved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas that are differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she regrets to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to her, results from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, Magyar, Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?'
According to Vicenova, in the near future, tough new fiscal policy rules are awaiting member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multiple-speed Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro zone and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
In the first place it was said that countries that want it cooperate with each other and those that don’t want it stay in their corner.”
"There will be a lot of institutes of this kind and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Vicenova said.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues with an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not only eurozone members.
History of a brand:
IBM Innovator Begins the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to look for the vocabulary that expresses IBM’s strategy as closely as possible, the closest one would be “long-term.”
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
Its slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the foundation of the company’s carefully crafted culture by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it has always remained faithful to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more"said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventing them.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was brilliant at the beginning in discovering talent—as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jammy, brain-storming online, from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a safe position in the field of business.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States given its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world's largest companies.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries are, for example, the banknote distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM was the second largest tech company by market capitalization (the first being Apple) this year with $220 billion, when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and the time - IBM for example failed to bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the advance movement you cannot emotionally hang on to the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor, which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM revenue, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, still in 1990 it was with more of the strongest participation motie hardware representative.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in prospective technology purchases.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its chief executive Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
The price of the IBM stock rose from 2008 in rocket by 120 percent, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM History: From slices of cheese to flights into the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it was originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - originally it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then cast a shadow on the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that the company's identity and culture have so far rested.
Watson headed the firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's tenure, revenue increased to $9 million and the firm began to expand in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of the director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and IBM computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos—on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as the field of commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a “Smarter Commerce” platform that helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that takes care of speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her home, she had no doubt that her couple would not survive.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he confessed in public that he loved him.
Eventually Darina resigned, accepted her husband's relationship and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the steps of the door of the house.
“He’s my son’s biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I talk completely normal, but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," concluded Joseph.
Women’s Worst Mistakes: Does It Matter To You?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines about the female vices that come to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your half of you make remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of sales?
In your case, you can talk about buying as a vice.
Some women think that they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you will say, who would resist the licking showcase of clothing stores, to look for yourself pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for men a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
“I would need to lose at least 5 pounds – should I start doing sports?”
"Do you mind?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of something?
Oh, yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases, the more women become poisonous.
Odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust, uncover the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they dirtyed the washbasin, stained the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of Sape
"With this garment worn in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this digging work on your partner several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much diligence.
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, slander, but also insults against someone are also typical of some women.
Women are particularly interested in relationships and thus are content to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will escape a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia’s victory during Monday’s NHL game on the Carolina Ice and is again at the top of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals in the match.
After the match, Jagr told reporters that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes that feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricane goals for the pallet and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm really happy about that."
“I want to play with him.”
"All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play for me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took some speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in the second third due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not hold up against an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the backline was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost punches as they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"It's null."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement over replacement this was not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For that we had limits," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the 30th attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax Jets goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at the time offered travel mainly in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a penchant for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, you had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought themselves and this habit persists until now.
The travels of the Czechs have been a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, the Czechs spent 4 million days of holidays abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in Western neighbouring countries has caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the travel agencies made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at this time to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the exchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased, which caused another important moment around 1997.
Due to increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997, which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what existed before.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the U.S. which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit the exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully rank in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holiday abroad including the accompanying charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end in an unresolved "one-sided" situation.
Czech football has been without a president for almost 5 months and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly, which is due to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules to proceed with.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football revert to divergences between the Association chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to choose.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the full-fledged officials.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the help also of the Office of State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Divergences still persist regarding the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiation, has also not contributed anything to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into bed.
"The apple of disagreement lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round that of the candidates who will have received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who will have received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the vote percentages.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and according to which it would be best not to change the regulations and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the rules of the elections established according to the statutes benefit Pelta the most among all the candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any wild ideas conceived by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Today's possible qualifying for the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations to drawing."
"This may again cause a blockage to the General Assembly."
"I still hope that common sense will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement among all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire direction of the football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight on which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the field of retaliation.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would be very pleased to welcome the parties torn apart within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the battle for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high position.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t run for office.”
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from reaching the head of the AFRT that would a priori be given favored for this election.
Paclik also points out that in case he wins the election he would hold this position of President only until the 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the position an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he says.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
“I’d like to change this picture,” he added.
What, it is said, particularly disturbs Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Union, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position as President.
“If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.”
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable for football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during a hearing in the context of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away with no pain.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Pilsen club."
Should Paclik win the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended in fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
“He has great abilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September drew a lot of attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the arbitration panel with Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his abilities to lead private firms and he has also since last year led the Plzen club which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups that tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, for example, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power among high-level policymakers would result in more gambling tax money for the sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should address."
“If it’s a gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Pilsen club as something negative even though he claims that the president of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my shares of the Pilsen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to litigation.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future disputes about the rules for elections.
Jablonec's official is very optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success of today's football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised precisely to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed, and this two-month delay might allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday."
"They feel this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily related to the Jablonec club, has worked for a large number of years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to direct Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone perceived."
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has received the full attention of delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibility for it in case it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with respect to his legal training and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate will be his first Vice-President.
He also hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, doesn't stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and has already had some successes."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
It should be a showcase for football.
“And I would also try to finish all the affairs that start with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he told Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there’s only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," Pelta optimistically said two days before the day was probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please a large number of people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a high-performance youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a particular area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football can take a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not present himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and issue doubts about each of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, they say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"In the last two years, there has been a lot of de facto work and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not want anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would not return to what it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and it’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen.”
"There are a number of things that can be blamed on me, but certainly not to bear any."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it, not just those who have been chosen.
And he reaffirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second division into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would end up in the first division."
"There would not be a situation like this with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Pilsen Club, entered the competition for the post of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I am constantly feeling the support of the Czech House that has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," Rajchl said, who is considering saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations and television contracts.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football ball would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
“If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a notable change among the people on the Commissions.”
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
Julia Stanek
UFO Optical Pools, Gorgeous Budapest Pools: Those who travel through Europe can live their blue miracle – and after touring the city or taking a long walk – can let their tired legs rest in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is one thing that should not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretching on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Jewels of the Bath". The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historical bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has conducted her "trips to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of bath culture.
Meder explains that she doesn't have much interest in the sport but he feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It’s annoying that swimmers should just contemplate blue tiles and settle for the stench of Javel’s water while joggers breathe the enchanting fragrance of spice forests or can listen to the gaze of the park’s cheerful birds.
"I wondered one day why pools should always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the strength of the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming pools are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multi-colored tiles, trellises.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose basins are filled with a building containing alkali and alkaline.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath one has the whole city in his eyes, one can admire the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which one can observe the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, from the <0xC3><0x81>rpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black and its lemon sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking out the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style Moorish room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from the Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a nice performance to fuse such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on commodities
The Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the stock market speculation on global commodities is pushing prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against Deutsche-Bank head Josef Ackermann, even though major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Raw material speculation was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the view that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demand – and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to criticism from U.S. competitors: he promised to investigate the allegations and said, "No business is worth putting the Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how badly today’s banks are harming the public interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obliged today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether it's about starving people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he hardly has to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would resist investing in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires to 1001 people.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would, following the survey, withstand all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43% would not recommend such a bank to their entourage, 49% responded that they would consider terminating their account to change banking institutions.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibitions in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is again open and holds place of exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its vivid and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief towards technical progress, then the pavilion of the good position of the Austrian architect for ex-university Karl Schwanz is a famous.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, lightweight and suspended.
Construction is considered to this day as an important stage in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW home and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna train station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang artworks, so not a good environment.
However, it was so long used, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has decayed more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out the work of transformation with the men established monuments and public protection she obtained.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and because for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and by his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a hole in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The heat bridge beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new operation, a screened light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origin remained, the house is painted in a shade of rust protection red-brown.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the authorities responsible for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the monuments protection office," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to the raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical “Drop-in-the-City” story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck urban construction: around the Jardin Suisse stands precisely the newly planned "quarter of the central station", with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another blow of luck will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend in this regard more than an additional 70 million this year.
The newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung reported earlier invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the railway network even in case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway facilities and docks is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The goal is to get rid of the docks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the head of the railway station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents also this winter.
Last winter the railway company had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is why many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot of work to do for years, as it needs to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator is making a series of accusations against the big banks that they had induced cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating proceedings in court," a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in New York.
The Bank did not acknowledge any faults in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other major banks aside and in the summer has assigned it to the Court of Justice JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit homes are the basis.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date back a few years, at the moment it is blowing a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous remedies to seek reparation or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has unleashed the biggest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, both U.S. state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for taking advantage in kind in a $200 billion mortgage deal.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of operations totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demanded that Frankfurter be held accountable for "substantial losses" but without citing a precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, is investing colossal sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Up until now, the major U.S. investor Warren Buffett has consistently explained that he does not invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies only lets bad predictions appear.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his mind about investments in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business is now entitled to be called "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic issue, that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment holding company has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM had never heard of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which had ensured reasonable profits even during the economic crisis.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been focusing on profitable IT services for some time now as an operating accounting center.
The pioneer of computing, more than 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands the business of.
But, on the contrary, Buffett is more concerned with rail freight, lubricants or machinery manufacturers.
Its Berkshire Hathaway holding holds nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich-based Rück.
This 81-year-old had taken back in the 1960s the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had ranked it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a total stock market value of over $220 billion and is among the most valuable tech companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a great friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the specter that was long believed to be dead is reappearing: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this far-right context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been discussed.
However, the far-right network that has been detected reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was allegedly a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right whirlwind.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasonable manner: it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community of Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a giggle: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hurriyet" does not deprive itself of drawing from it unambiguous conditions.
"it starts to puer", This is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspicious circles of the far right, the authors wonder.
More than one is willing to at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be cluttered, the migrants will have nothing but self-defense and armament."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past.
Previously, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish head of state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population was producing.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime is patinating from crisis to crisis.
It is a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July that he would occupy a position almost as spectacular in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed, Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved solidity and conveyed kind comments about future colleagues.
"UBS succeeded the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and flared up about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered suffering - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency of the administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
He then assumed responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has once again proven that it has long earned the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been patinating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, spares the so proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In today's perspective, one wonders: how could I have simply been mistaken at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007, it turned out that for the first time something was not turning round at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising manner, who was previously regarded as a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we knew why he had left.
The division of the bank had flared with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion and crossed it.
For this, it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have flinched their eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was once again to announce losses of billions, with the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrawing.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought in the UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We weren’t able to save the UBS once again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, he followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the affluent clientele, who had perhaps cheated the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the removal of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank had lost credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of securities traders: a single securities merchant flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not turning round.
And it is published: with risk management in the investment bank it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank said: “The problem with UBS is that it does not have the control of risk in its hands.”
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their office, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the Credit Suisse palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive at the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front there are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other out of the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And yet they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle of sub-primes as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the small-country government coalition of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
With up to around 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland – and recorded an ever-increasing growth.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in Latvia with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Head of UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who knows models and statistics very well, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end on Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the executive meetings during which the Wuffli Group leader has always uttered the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of the banks at that time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some of the steps have already been successful.
In the field of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisors, who were responsible for this, however, pointed to a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the larger banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-premium investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and passed on securities based on U.S. mortgage loans — but that has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
“Still in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Jobs at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been bankrupt.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on the management of assets, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophie vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
On Thursday, the head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank unexpectedly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must carry out the business of UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It eliminates 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He said publicly until now only that he was going to get an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.

Industrial production on the continent has suffocated hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in its nucleus.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.

U.S. investors have expressed themselves in a skeptical way: “We are not an island, on the other hand dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman’s management.
Europe will soon not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the wind and entered the American tech industry.

Smart squirrels spread in cities
In many places, freckles are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these very intelligent animals have not been chased out of cities for a long time.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The squirrels have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the freaks from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed the possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The protectors of nature based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected freckles: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional living spaces.
Hunting, arranging and slaughtering typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in the Westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the slaughter of crows in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourds.
“Normal eviction, eviction, is useless,” said Leer’s city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests with the help of pressurized water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser von Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals move away, large colonies divide, and they disperse elsewhere.”
The eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves compelled to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the eviction of animals with aversive conditioning and catchy offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-path-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent freaks.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freaks not only use working instruments to get to a treat, but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four freckles recently, how far the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crumble a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determined that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, the cunning crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their booty with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small hose.
Three of the four freaks are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at 2012 European Championships
The hopes of a coup by the Bosniaks and Turks remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifying rounds of the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal went wrong against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0-0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the relegation match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was also nothing more blazing in the 0-0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) relief against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other draws for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty handed (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was dealt a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the eliminations for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a head ball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark awarded a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 vice-champion of Europe managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the European Championship for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had a bit of luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class keeper of the already shot down Czechs, once again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the 2002 European Championship third, the Croatians were able to look forward to their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, striker Kazim Kazim was not even able to bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at the 62nd Minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that the defense of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first goaltender.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and squeezed the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Up to 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this growing country.
China’s growth plans are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase its turnover by 2015 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded revenues of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our business (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, backed by comprehensive information."
The Personal Massacre
Peter Englund’s new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that holds your heart.
One tip to get started: carefully tear this page and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fogs of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "an anti-history work."
It features some well-known names, important treatises or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion of strategies and material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like". We find "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, go mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives here swing like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are lit.
The book by Peter Englund deviates from traditional history books.
It brings a denial to the idea that World War I is summed up only by the terrible trench war on the Western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are found under hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsé-tsé flies are an untreatable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people such a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordita.
When gunshots resonate in the distance, and you are a home mom, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall Ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on the replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own craving for savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that no one has such a synonym.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When you’re resigned to sacrificing yourself, you hope to have an audience,” he wrote.
It is, unfortunately, rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as much basic behavior as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"The most desperate ones apply it to their eyes, which results in blindness for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task as a human being.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps how the war has "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New", rather than complete.
The work of Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized from your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to proceed with an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be rehearsals of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the department's regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are being better trained against riots – counter-terrorism measures that consist of quickly displacing a large number of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park reached “at the last minute,” said one habituated, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise”.
"The few police officers I know who were called did not know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person said.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department's hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a conducive time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the fewest people," he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages echoing from the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m., police said, leaving time for occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the chief of the police department, said the action had been taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly detained by the officers.
Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street, along the park’s west side, were able to capture images.
As police moved west across the crowded business of the protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and bags of sheets filled with clothes, sanitation department teams followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away and the images were released on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About a dozen people in the camp's epicenter hung up together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
The emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation was completed about an hour and a half later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disorder to public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most qualified officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of policemen were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades have been laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were spotted digging the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
A policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union sues the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that lost their jobs last month, plans to try the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs, a disproportionate impact on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to have the dismissals canceled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, among the city's least paid, lost their jobs on October 7, the union leaders compared these layoffs to political revenge for not letting the city access to a health care fund led by the last-time workers' groups.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this allegation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council responded, mentioning that dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
37th District Council officials said they would file a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce prosecutions at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City's Education Department will be the defendant. Complainants will be represented by eight lay workers, all black or of Latin American descent, like most school aid workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and could therefore not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to underfunding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa facilities, 17 school aid workers have lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aid workers at Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutions claim that "It's not a neighborhood of wealthy parents that can bring in funds to fill the budget shortfall."
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents’ coordinators.
The memo used the term "overpayment" to describe the action, although "overpayment" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," and "not just because of overshoot."
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
It would seem that Republicans and Democrats finally found an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and their "court for American troops".
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
Congress’s indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as in June last year?
Senator and Chairman of the Committee Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional budget amendment, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but this is not without having tried.
The Goodlatte Amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Commons of the amendment only for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters – notably new Republicans who want to gild their resumes – the chance to brag about being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August required a vote by the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment banning flag profanation.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose it.
As eager as Members have been to propose amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate is slower than in the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
“Slaughtered but not beaten,” Gabrielle Giffords says in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to death in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona) appeared Monday night on a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover first rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared in the "20/20" television newspaper on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show tackled its difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", aired on the eve of the couple's new book titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is spotted on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask for a change in her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with the doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There have been a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, dur, dur."
On her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I've been beaten."
"So I'd say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" Kelly said.
You've just been massacred.
And you'll get out of it, recover and come back stronger than ever.
More Compassion than Respect for the Troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie suit stood up at his feet to cheer him up.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer present at the gala, who was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan," the senior military official wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, it was just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have established between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military officials say.
The public is acting more and more as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who made him pass the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to keep the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from combat.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when speaking to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and that sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way we valued it in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a military’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of enduring service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if she could go to her room for a drink.
“It was an alarm signal,” Elizabeth Lyman said.
But the Texan sidelined his concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man caught her from behind, threw her to the ground, and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will look forward to the court ruling at a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a lawsuit against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, has been filed.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rapes within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide justice after the allegations.
Susan Burke declares that she takes care of the gallant soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - it will sue several, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Iron Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged harm is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely solely male.
In Iraq as well as Afghanistan, women’s soldiers’ teams are playing an increasingly important role, notably in making contact with local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are ongoing in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the not-for-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively common fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network's Service, a women's rights network.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine separate bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in the Susan Burke case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her aggressor's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits in front of a judge, at a trial in which she is questioned about her sexual intercourse with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, which ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was made,” Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember saying to my commander, 'This wasn't his trial, this was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington’s Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial doesn't work for them, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will bring her hundreds of other plaintiffs together for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy expressing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on the cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently released by DEMOS’s think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their optimism towards their own violence, their coming attitudes towards their own
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.”
The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to "Likes", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three contents per day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research papers whose site name appears in the title by nearly 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people that you might not be able to approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunkenness exploits were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would all too often speak of alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the 2010 midterm election turnout rate, and a national happiness index (thanks to only available information - the digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasury available for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information differently than through the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about whether a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study will be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and a pen remain the best tools you can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and social is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and Inhuman": First Appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” when he first appeared at the trial taking place in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templars of Norway," he said in front of a 500-person audience room.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims' parents were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, staring journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane, and also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the sadness or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it's not," a relative of a victim said.
"It would have been a lot easier."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will air this week in the first part of a major market movie is how much that creative spirit had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from a "disease making them think that a brilliant idea makes an exaggerated amount of manual work...
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs’ death that a full video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly backed up, is the basis of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will air in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technology philosophies and his business strategies.
Incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him the elbows to accelerate and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, Lost Interview is an oddly prescient look. Steve Jobs assesses what he sees as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“Throughout all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed about how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed at face value, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and call for free over long distances.
The device has been the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you were yelling at the public phone and it happened to you a minute later at the public phone next door,” Jobs says, laughing.
“We were young and, thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't know much, but we invented a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have come up with: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself wakes up.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s departure):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a wire.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees visiting the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever designed desktop."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On Improving Innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles down to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working with only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... they yelled at me saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are breathing a sigh:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copy or a better printer, and then?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it’s these types of people] who end up leading companies and product staff are pushed away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this position of monopoly is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the required manual labor.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to make...Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (those concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
That's partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Health Law Opponents as Court Gathers
On the day the Supreme Court meets in private to consider the issue of political disagreement, namely whether President Obama’s opposition to the health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend him.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, because a monumental argument of 5:30 a.m. is expected in March, and the result will likely be such as to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue over the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
It included, among others, Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Act.
The guests starring at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would undoubtedly argue with the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisings from law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervener, an honorary guest, or listed on the agenda of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the case’s law firms, as well as a firm with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges drank and dined and went to a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismantles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Furthermore, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in advocating the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record order of $18 billion for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, twin-floor airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is quite a case when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $ 18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing announced the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-courier.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and convenience for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft is more than a billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines as it represents their most important expenses - would not be so detrimental to them as the country would make money with the rise in oil price.
This is an important point because these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or delay their aircraft orders as the oil price rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's dominance in the bulk carrier market and helps to curb the attempted embezzlement of competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the Aeronautics Fair comes four months after Airbus announced that it will postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its thrust following customers’ demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Clearly Beaten in Michoacán Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says that the drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister seems to have lost her attempt to access Michoacán’s governorship in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race to the post of governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio in an interview on Monday following the elections.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized the polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until he lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have made little of Calderon, who was at the head of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's state of origin, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Nonetheless, the violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally gave up the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
BASD strongly urges Asia to come to aid the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the CEO of Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers should “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has dangerously skyrocketed and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy will go into recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds from the U.S. financial bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade and Industry, said "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to make Europe accept aid to 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day, or even less.
"One day, they will find that the Greeks are retired at 50 and going on a holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD’s forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “risks of loss” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "relief plans" to protect themselves from economic upheaval and major capital leaks.
Pentagon Warns of Potential Defense Reductions
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called seizure would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“A reduction of this magnitude, applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unworkable – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The cuts would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
“While the financing of the accounts of contingency operations abroad in time of war is not directly affected by the seizure, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disruptions in the base budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war.”
“The personnel managing the salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a seizure of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of Panetta's letter.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not what we should impose on ourselves.”
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the Pentagon's highest position accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen – a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said during her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed, ill-prepared, and unable to face potential adversaries.”
"De facto, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could “generate significant operational risks: delays in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cutting edge, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel, and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The administrators of Penn State have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has taken the stand for a fool by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violating funding for campaigns related to coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The tales of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers gave test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout out, "I got you," deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research in such psychologies, in particular, psychologies.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don’t sneeze, blush, or always stir.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the statement structure, facial microexpressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and still emerging knowledge about deception, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are able to read others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centered on themselves" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people tend to be introverted.
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what is known as "setting the benchmark data."
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe your subject’s posture, laughter, and voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally shakes their feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them shake their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and nonverbal misconduct.
Consider these clues as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or present a “post-interview” relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped away using the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use distant language: “I have not had sexual intercourse with this woman...Mrs. Lewinsky” or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be overturned after the threat of late U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking union anger while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect them to the project.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Nebraska dunes zone, and is confident the project will still gain approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, from vast underground sources.
“It’s a real way forward,” Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, he would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers oppose the plan, insisting that a law forcibly removes the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing Environmental Impact Study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation into the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family says Disco diva Patti LaBelle, thrown into a violence outburst in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" streak frightened 18-month-old Geneviève Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and posed for her daughter for a while.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to get her," she says.
LaBelle angered the pregnant woman.
"She told me in an aggressive tone: 'You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'What you say or think doesn't interest me.'
She became furious and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who drove her towards a car waiting for them, Roseanna Monk says.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologising to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives did not return our appeals to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-named change, which has generated high expectations in terms of the progress of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the growth of the principals has not been observed.
The February low temperatures, apart from causing trillions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical decline of another 31.16 percent in the economy which affected agriculture.
According to the report of allocations by frosts issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops were chiche and sinums.
The decline in economic activity has generated, up to November, a steady increase in unemployment rate in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, a steady increase in unemployment rate in the state during the first three quarters of the year.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of market liquidity due to a constraint on resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars something that they don't use in an easy way, they don't work for it.
Detained Migration
López Cervantes noted that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of entry difficulties and secondly because on entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of serious
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is worsening given the high level of serious lack of work conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state work there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's shift are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the workers of Sinaloa was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reached $630,697, representing a decrease of $87.74 per cent the same year-on-year ratio of $14,12 per million.
In turn, the State Government's Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the tertiary sector companies.
Leave this
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July to the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the congress of the state of no more than 2 billion pesos, and the approval of the congress of the state was of 600 billion pesos.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, Mario López Valdés’ first year of government demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it was necessary to align the effort of all and especially the good already synchronized march of this new team of Government," hopefully the next year is much better.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year held back the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that is not turning fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of e flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
To Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation Patronage of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards more productive activities of dynamism.
"Overall, we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be detonated," he says.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channelizes the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to be done," he says.
Sentenced to 8 Kilos of Marijuana
A person living in Novolato has been sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was in a white pick-up truck carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s place where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debt to Contributions to Works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished where there are serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because the State Government has failed to fulfil its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us some of it," he said, "and we, to not register any delays, started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to be able to access these programs, had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made a request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide nearly $12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation in the field of radio and television is an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical reservation and subordination.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers also decided to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards for the public administration to prepare for them.
"I also consider that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the leadership of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, invaded in some form the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count is being analyzed in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by the Prep, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the 8 per cent of the votes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local norms to the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline so that this electoral process could enter into force.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he has no right to "sanction or challenge" them.
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no minutes of voting and counting in the file of the vote is not with the President of the latter; or there are obvious errors or alterations.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the second ballots of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed candidate who won the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or below one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is a representation of the candidate or party who has a vote.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the joint count it results that the difference between the supposed winner candidate and the second place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party from which the candidate came second, in which case the party that was the object of the vote will be excluded from the packages.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel’s last wish was that his ashes should be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the watch chapel of Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former tech bachelor's colleagues and the American football team Felipe Bacio was part of when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had a truck ache; but he always pursued his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, for this he knows that his uncle dies doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
It was with honors that we said goodbye to Lt. Colonel Teiló de la Fuerza Aérea Mexicana, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute that was headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth and Sixth Mile Areas, the students of the Mexican Army and the Mexican Army.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside Secretary of the Government José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his brothers and sisters Christina and his students.
Three abandoned bodies found in Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with a pardon shot, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 kilometer drive from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have gone through this place have observed that in the property, whose fence is beige and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A metre away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were stretched out on the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to the other, except for a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are believed to be related to sequestrations, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the published information, in a first act on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., military personnel made a surveillance run in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a license plateless car with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well-drawn," he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian bonds BTP at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government very much.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief break at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections advance.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spaniards is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, account for an extensive record of inter-selection Class A games, Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs in England maintain intense activity in national league and cup championships and competitions in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (defence 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, head coach of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA alongside the other centennials of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke forward, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is ready for the centenary number, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are left-handed Junior Díaz, with 48 appearances, and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five overcame the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those who have fewer. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even come at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet started.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to take place in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and will make its only stopover in Central America on Sunday.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcription of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for the holidays; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity in the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time has passed until this concert.
Some people have already said that their concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have given two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the point of this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we love those songs and what we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it is also becoming more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very emotional.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be still friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t go any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what it brought, without taking into account the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which really does not interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record before Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was always laughing and how it made me laugh.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It's true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why are you always changing the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassist I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep under the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came out at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney now make the best music they've ever done.
At first, his music had darker content and now this one has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
That’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, called very obscure songs, even though they may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and those songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that one can be happy too and even like that one can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of imprisonment for humanitarian reasons, undoubtedly he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been purging his imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army squadron of annihilation that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will begin on Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, trade and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the South American presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of his ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) gray list, integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
On a commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, was designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s spokesman in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman said that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second turn" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a blink of an eye to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber must travel through platforms mined by dangers to release Princess Peach.
Even if I player finds novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for the $70 million conspiracy to launder.
Thus, the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that Portillo demanded to be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeys the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he "did not help" in any judicial resolution and had given way to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done involves an executive proceeding after exhausting all judicial and constitutional instances to judge the former 2004-2004 mandate holder.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of the Q120 million misappropriation of funds to the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long-standing centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of a celebrated event in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly educated people, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalized.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unity of Trinijove’s work.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and the current municipal councilor Eco-Socialist Ricard Goma.
Also present in the large hall of Fabra i Coats were the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the General Director of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left at noon yesterday the building they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing micro parties that were desperate for neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and some of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residue of any kind, especially alcoholic beverage boxes.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the occupation of the building her business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property were unfair to her because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the recreational space had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the guests of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last week.
The head of the club explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgave" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civility that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not focus on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for all gates of access to Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a theme of conversation for all Barcelona architects.
This is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former cast of elected speak about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have appeared.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is opportune.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the one of the green house blocks was not carried out at the end.
"We must start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the title "Doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and which had in the Forum area "his swan singing".
The first fear is the very demarcation of the borders on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, overcoming it.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disasters.”
By sticking more to the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles region of Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he believes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe passage that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that we should create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because from the basis of the contest it lacks an overall vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project for one of the doors to shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its view, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that carries out a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Casino Red’s legal authority granted pardon to the Mayor of Monterrey’s brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a lawsuit for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Agent 3 for Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the State Capital's Old Quarter.
He stayed there for the next 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's Officer dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for blackmailing Casino Red owners with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonas, such as the one concerning the collection of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the house of gambling allow in operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, Attorney General Ramiro Arias questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling company's associates had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
According to file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and subsequently no complaints can be made regarding the trial against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for the damages and no punishment.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) said the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented in a structural way.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can take a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and this took place on an ascending soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, TBS holder Pérez Jácome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for takeoff, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-altitude cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought a lower altitude area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available to date makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the aircraft remains makes it possible to assume that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the site of the accident there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated during his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a larger area than the surrounding area, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the assumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security leads investigation to discover obesity gene in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Child and Adolescent Obesity Genetics' protocol that will allow for the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 20th Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the rightful and ineligible population to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence to minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sporting Unit Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sporting Unit Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to nutrition.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays it will be applied to all participants of the anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (it is sought to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity in boys and 47 percent in girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight,” said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the complete assessment of the children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
It even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, doctors hand it over in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying sitting in front of the TV most of the day and using means of transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, that is, the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat paste with cornmeal wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins in this protocol and genetic analysis.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid crazies
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a blend with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 cassis every rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the pavement was complete, even the pavement would be reduced.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltens, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthens, which together give the pavement its characteristic screw.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt-jouta becomes breaking, a-jouta-
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he says, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would spread better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil becomes wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes bruises.
In the process of formation of a cassis, he says, the first that spoils is the rolling film and only later the asphalt layer is affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for breakage formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent breakage formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led Melina Ramírez Serna not to receive the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle receives her title number 14 as a princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198) by Gijuca (198), by María (90) by María (90), by Alreda (198), by Alreda (198), by Maria (198), by Alre) by Alre (198), by Alre (198), by Rosa (198), by Rosa (190), by Rosa (190), by Rosa (190), by Rosa (190), by Rosa), by Rosa (190), by Rosa (190), by Rosa (19), by Rosa), by Rosa (19), by Rosa (19).
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite that in each presentation has shown that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Missia' Emportona Navarro or Emportona Navarro.
The first factor considered key in the decision made by the jury to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culture, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is 'The Little Prince', it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment" is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer did not please first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses put forward is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "this aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine."
And it was noted in her first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and her two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though she had seemed sure of herself at the two parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for Canal RCN's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not receive the Queen's crown".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by her back defects and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact for me had not been too notorious, left him with points the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the Valle candidate were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest awards for the first time, after the swimsuit parade a cruel prediction emerged that was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was making to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
So was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopist from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a dactylographer at the CTI in Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme head of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprinters working in the CTI’s local offices, this week it was the turn of “availability” of Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of forensic investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after following proper courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big awaited him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the map with Guillermo León Sáenz's ten fingerprints (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant from the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galton magnifying glass, ink, a pickup and a lantern, Eliasar compared the body’s fingerprints with those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that, yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a dactylographer from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in resolving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinters support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also dismiss or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and that a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if that doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “fingerprints are being extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a picker or tape is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the delinquent database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignated" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a court order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters were clashing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a judicial order that allows the 'indignated' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the "indignated" response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the place and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignated' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power stations, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, although Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists to whom we had also handcuffed.
The organization says that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of members of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned building - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of this judicial order at that time and they were even handing it over to officers who were monitoring the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing "laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were “violating the law”.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the place to be evacuated because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people" because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
“This morning’s early morning evacuation was disgusting and demonstrates that at bottom Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman said, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Noel TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", bailout in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program of Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be out on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet diffusion of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary to support in a crêche.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Noel show also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "pute" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Rescued After Earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become the nuclear crisis, Japan’s worst disaster since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo estimated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to definitively turn the page: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
In addition, the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that calls for taking advantage of the crisis to consolidate – or rebuild – infrastructure, use deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the turmoil of U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September for the yen’s contribution.
While markets continue to be headquartered in peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government is not shrinking its guard.
"We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it has dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, n dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to get caught up in the maze that leads to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday reported that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days set in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new measures in the future.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the Staff Disciplinary Code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise any doubts about his position: "We are committed to assisting the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The Conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the $8,000 that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letters of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by Papandreou’s referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign “a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible”.
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return to Athens "very quickly" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of $8,000, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "predominant" place in this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a preponderant global position in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has the goal of reducing the number of people who are living in the United Nations by the end of 2015.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and opportunities for greater opportunities".
We have "reached a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are coming out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought to him yesterday the qualifier of "leader of the family".
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said micro-credits meant “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” developed-country governments must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its doors to the contaminated".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen on the agenda but prevailed in the fall, notably to satisfy activists who judge the government's policy too lax about the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's master idea - and the motion - is based on a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe, but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the EU's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the motions adopted by the congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is, too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced the weight of Germany.
Concerned about appeasing the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for a hole.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud on sick leave?
After the grants, the UMP and the government launch the disease arrest offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a willingness to make savings in a rigorous context, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
First, with a view to budget savings: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of shortages on private employees before taking care of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could arouse anger, but would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on public servants a day of non-compensated deficiency in the event of work cessation (they do not have a deficiency period so far, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also raises the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will reimburse," Xavier Bertrand told RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the ad effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stop fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That is 2.5% of health care costs.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day off sick.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of sickness stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to work stops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absenteeism rate (for health reasons or not) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at sick leave represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it is only on a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sickness arrests of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169,000 cases are “unjustified”, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent a deficit of 9 to 15 billion euros in tax earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to rebuild its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said Monday, 14 November, before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of fiscal adjustment," the head of government said, making his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday backed the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the MPs of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would sign under no pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, says report from Royal Society of Canada
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, from a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, Quebec is the country with the highest rate of deaths, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything to the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or inconsistent persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, we would find more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained on the duty to respect the refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the area of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts signatories to the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," Deschamps said.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he says, “there are signs and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called “manifest pro-euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces "conspiration"
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad protested yesterday in front of the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a “complot” against the country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus while neighboring Turkey and Jordan have taken a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, told the BBC in an interview.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime had failed since the beginning of the year.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country towards which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tough line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces were killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians died "when heavy machine guns were fired and fired at Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was “going towards the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he called “a dangerous step”.
Syria “will not bend,” he added, assuring that “urgent plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said was locked in "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2nd, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities affected by the protest and the release of the detained protesters.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League's decision was "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while remaining cautious about supporting any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy (country)
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded some time from the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in talks with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, after meeting with the President-elect of the Council.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a restricted list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are specific deadlines” to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying he was “certain that markets will be patient and understand”.
His appointment by the president had initially been hailed by the markets, but concerns rose to prominence, notably after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister-designate should form a team comprising mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has committed himself, once he has taken office, to work in the emergency and with the aim that Italy "redeems the protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary equilibrium target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further measures of rigor.
Italian bosses' patron Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth cannot respect deficit parameters".
Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy must place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was “seriously concerned” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing largely from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly co-operated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked during the bulk of his military career program in this technology.
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or progressed little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," the human rights organization Human rights First stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s official.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he said, adding that this could lead to improved police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more readily, live the activity of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to recast someone else’s message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of Google+ and large public networks Facebook.
On the network, users were debating "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austro-Hungarian
Inclusion of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (Austria).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Greece.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by a single chunk, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest extra each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria thus responds to a request from the eurozone member countries at the Brussels summit on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then called for the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value by the end of 2012.
The measure adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen (disambiguation)
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will act as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of strength since 1945 in the face of the green note.
But the yen has been steadily rising ever since, doped by purchases from investors who see it as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rebounded below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was priced around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency undermines the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign income from Japanese firms when converting them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the egg's fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power rebounded with growth in the third quarter – 1.5% from the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the yen’s price did not reflect “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), raising to 55 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Rates rise, stock exchanges flank
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Constantly worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock exchanges plunge a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions on the yields of euro area debts in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, suffering in turn renewed fears from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow variation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the eurozone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, she stepped back after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, met at a congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very alarming levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds with the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time to the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the eye of the markets, as parliamentary elections are being held in the country on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between Germany's and Spain's 10-year bonds has reached a new record high.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it’s really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a further recession.
Energy Policies:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is good that an election is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and instead on the role of nuclear.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will result in a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be tackled in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not to mention the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a substitute source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just wants to build new generation power plants.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, continue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to add a unit to its fleet by resuming the construction of a power plant that was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a leap in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all of these nasty effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
European champion of wind power, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; according to which its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key competitive factor and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest any opposition in principle to this energy, the surveys show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has helped to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it drives a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them highly non-delocalizable job creators.
If France were to decide to withdraw from nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of sorrow the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years while its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no source of production of miraculous electricity, nor is there any diabolical.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them the free path to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has become the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is obsessed with trivialities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps payable electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the countries that the growth of migrants is positive, and there is a strong consensus among the experts on immigration.
Restrict immigration anemic growth and detrimental to employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to substitute for national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, who are exerting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, practicing mostly occupations in sectors that are deprived of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job offer.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on nationals' salaries and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% of real long-term wages.
And that without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant reaching the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue less expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets on average for the rest of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go looking for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, by deterring immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought.
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote and exercise it in the most direct manner possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an “instrument of oppression” as the former republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this regard double revealing value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be surpassed.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic combat have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A white-seed to the absolute European monarch or a leap of faith into the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutters, but an exercise, common, full-fledged, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to return to popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
For together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for a European economic government.
Come on.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the construction of Europe.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" the Republicans.
The Revolution in Interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
Contactless smart cards are becoming more widespread
The World Smart Card Fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most bearable segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or settle your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and account for nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distributing contactless credit cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
"We plan to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Corporation, too, said yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, Terrorist Front Expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired the certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January allegedly uncovered the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terrorism
The analysis of past calls focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we probably have to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for years that the sect has received outside financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressed Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated people of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for Sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is invading the city, 800 people are dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs of the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram took over the secure police headquarters during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, which the al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying staggering statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strongpoint.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans – often unsupported – fuse.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed in the race for the “Great Old Party” nomination, threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and question them “for manipulating their currency,” a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire chunks of his industry to Asia.
So bad if it must involve the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I’m elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he bragged.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, has an embarrassing disregard for the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in the matter of counter-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of Iraq’s “boys”, on his tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking a weak label to him.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, rather positive.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to enslavement.
And, by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part, on Tuesday, on the Baltic shores, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe each year through a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site seems to be a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But this is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, highly gas-consuming Western countries, whose deposits are declining.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us in an organic way,” Fillon confirmed when inaugurating the pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-clad steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred must have been abducted or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project officials gave up on it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently set up off their coasts.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will stop the gas passing in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have predicted welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of traveling at a speed of 3 meters per second, he delivers accurate information about possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 bars at the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, the entire capacity of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to get back into their expenses, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door for the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specifics of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a fragrance of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine gave the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the twentieth century ", says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robotic portrait of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now has almost 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her bookshelves in bookshops, from the Fnac to small downtown shops, and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand stands out on a whole range of supports.
A success that has made enviable: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of people with disabilities.
" The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for unemployed people with disabilities, many obstacles remain before access to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very prevalent: 53% for people with disabilities, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that complicate the return to employment, and that "constitute the knot of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
This is for objective brakes.
There remains the unsaid, the mentalities that are evolving, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise for the City association indicated that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of wheelchair users, mentally or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of 1987.
The latest known figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ workers with disabilities, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What of happiness"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match brings them before they faced the Bleus on Tuesday evening.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made the peace.
Five months after his striker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise to say about him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and that he's Belgian."
"I want to go forward," said the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and in selection, "it's a whole, if he's justified."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
Managed against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a supporter,” he said.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "private" character of this meeting.
In front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We just crossed paths."
"Being able to play against them is only happiness!"
With goodwill, Leekens has for his part referred to "pride".
"Pride" of contesting "a gala match".
"Proud" also to see - as a "neighbor" - that France is "returned to a very high-level team" just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunder job," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You're going to find out in the next matches." This one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts its return dam against Bosnia with a lot of optimism this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the time, both teams were lacking in realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been running since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
In fact, Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unleash.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it is obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but he was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, but it involves a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party obviously announces itself "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said.
The zero reported on Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it involves a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal outside," said Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, as long as you're realistic this time.
