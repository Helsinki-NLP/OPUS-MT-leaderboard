Members of the Welsh Assembly don’t want to “walk on muppets”
Some members of the National Assembly will be dissatisfied with the proposal to adopt the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) for their names.
The problematic solution comes from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour leader, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “rhyme with Twp and Pwp.”
For our readers, it’s not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means “stupid” and pwp means “cookie”.
According to a member of the Assembly from the Welsh Party, his organization in general “remained dissatisfied” and proposed other options.
Representatives of the Conservative Party "do not object" to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close in writing to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced approximately as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting a bill to change the name, made the following statement: “The final decision as to the names of the Members of the Assembly will, of course, be left to them.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowers the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the “Parliament of Wales” instead of the “Assembly” found widespread support among the local population.
With regard to the naming of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option of “Welsh Parliament Members” (or WMP), while the option of MWP received the most public support.
It appears that the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it will not be easy for the Chairperson, Elina Jones, to find a solution that satisfies everyone.
Reform laws would include other changes to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against the accession of its northern neighbor to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name, said he will not recognize the results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is just the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Harlem Revenues: St. Martin's Bells Are Silenced Forever
“The elders in the area I was talking to said that there were bars and churches around every corner,” Adams says.
“And now there is neither one nor the other.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar ceased to be a kind of living room for the whole area, where they regularly came.”
But as for the churches, it is worrying that the funds received from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter how much their leaders have hoped for. “Sooner or later they will be left with nothing.”
On the site of the church, he added, there will be a multi-apartment house, whose residents are unlikely to support the remaining parishes in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams said, “and that will bring the day when such churches will be finally closed, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was bought by a black parish located in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin’s Church came into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on 125th Street, Harlem’s main trading artery, where they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered significant damage, and in the course of the restoration work, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who replaced him as head of St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carillon “bells for the poor.”
But the expert, who tested the carillon in July, called it a “cultural heritage” and a “unique historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin’s Church that was the world’s first instrument of its kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play on a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merrieuezer, no replacement has yet been found in St. Martin's Church.
In the last few months, there has been a difficult situation around St. Martin’s Church with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, addressed the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost of works” to the parish assembly, although the latter had no relation to the choice of architects and contractors who were sent to the parish.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old diver who was producing lobster.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunt season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and sustained bodily injury.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with the station KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he was diving with friends and after about half an hour heard the boy's cry for help. Together with friends they sailed on a boat to the scene of the attack and dragged the teenager.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was loudly delighted to catch the lobster, but quickly "understood that he was shouting "I was bitten!
They bit me!”
On his way to the diver, Hammel noted that "he had completely torn the skin around the wrist."
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘Here’s a shark!’” Hammel says.
The boy was taken to Reddy Children's Hospital (San Diego) by helicopter; his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was spotted at the site a few weeks ago, but it was not classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had sustained injuries in the upper thorax.
Authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to conquer the UK’s perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury is set to set up cosmetics and perfume departments in the Boots, Superdragon and Debenhams stores with cosmetic consultants, modeled on luxury department stores.
The perfume and cosmetics market in the UK is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the field of fashion and home goods sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this desired market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country will be represented by the next <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and the next <0xC2><0xA3>8 billion.
Supermarket owners are looking rather than filling up the shelves that have previously been placed under televisions, microwaves, home goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market seem to be a good solution.
According to representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetics products to 3,000 names; including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the branded line of products "Boutique-Cosmetics" with the transition to products for vegans will be reorganized to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two of Sainsbury’s stores will feature fragrance shop kiosks: the first was opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second is expected to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
E-commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products every day in small shops near home have led to the fact that supermarkets are forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Seinsbury, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket network is battling for buyers in a competitive fight with cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Hundreds of Seinsbury supermarkets host Argos outlets, and some of them are now home to Habitats stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to an increase in food sales and revenue from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetics and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sinsbury and Boots was organized, but there were further disagreements between the participants regarding the division of revenues from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinsbury (a total of 281 stores) to Lloyds Pharmaceuticals for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products from La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Seinsbury, said: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favorable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with the advice.
Our range of brands for any taste, pleasant design and convenient location of stores will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of shopping. "
Peter Jones 'angry' reacted to Holly Willowby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The star of the show "The Logo of the Dragon" Peter Jones "angry" with the exit of the TV host Holly Willowby from the 11 million pound deal, which she intended to conclude with the lifestyle brand Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with ITV "Marx and Spen"
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show host of This Morning announced her decision on Instagram.
Willowby’s decision to leave their profitable lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Tale.
According to our sources, Jones was "angry" when a TV viewer's favorite during a busy meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after signing new contracts of up to 1.5 million acres, she would not have enough time.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop, and its sales were expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old star announced her departure on Instagram, while Jones himself left the UK on a private jet to one of his villas.
According to one of the sources, “The Truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision stunned all parties to the deal.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because there were a few weeks left before the launch of the brand.
The headquarters in Marlow has an entire warehouse filled with ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that leaving this morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as potential delays in the launch of the line.
It is also about breaking up long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand with Tara Kapp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company’s board in March.
Both couples often spend holidays together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of Dan Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin in the lead role of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We can’t comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiation, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that the media would throw at him because of the “unworthy president” comment and the positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“Nothing I didn’t give up.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in a re-entry meeting after Trump called their first summit in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, high-ranking North Korean diplomat Lee Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still awaiting “relevant U.S. response” after the first meeting.
Instead, the US, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have borne fruit: rocket tests have been put to an end, hostages have been released, and U.S. troops remaining on the territory of the DPRK have also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy is nothing strange.
“Behave like the president is so simple, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street breaking into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: recorded catastrophic destructions, victims are estimated by hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs said there was no need for their help.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost a roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have clearly made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, but we do not yet know if a foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sutopo, an official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether it is appropriate to involve international organizations.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, no siren was included in Palu to alert the population, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transportation between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital, previously docked in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palu, but the journey to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia’s old infrastructure the main focus of his election campaign and has spent vast funds on improving roads and railways.
However, President Joko’s administration, running for a new term next year, has been plagued by funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for exacerbating the interfaith enmity between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other shotguns.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea with a goal in the far upper corner of the goal
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.
Starridge received a pass from Jordan Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He shifted to the left and broke into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and found itself in the far upper corner of the grid.
The goalkeeper of Cape Arrisabalo jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starridge said: "The whole point was to be in this position and get the ball, players like Shack are always at their best at attacking, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible."
“I saw Kante approaching me, took the ball and, thinking for a short time, broke through the goal.”
After the first half of the match, Chelsea led with a score of 1-0, the goal in the 25th minute was scored by the Belgian Eden Azar.
The central striker of Chelsea, handing the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, broke through the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played the game for one touch.
Then he handed over the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar overtook the defense and struck Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker from the left flank, hitting the far corner of the grid.
Liverpool will meet with the team of Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place at the stadium of San Paolo in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will take place on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Relief Agency said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, under the ruins of buildings destroyed as a result of an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, there are many people left. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused tsunamis with waves up to 6 meters high, said the spokesman of the office in Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was flooded with debris from collapsed houses.

Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among the locals.
Criminal Police Inspector O'Hagen said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I strongly ask anyone who has been in the John Street area in Birkenhead and could be observing or hearing anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something on the video recorder. Please contact us with any information that may help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim lived in Birkenhead and her body was found on the territory of the complex.
This afternoon, supposedly familiar victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim’s immediate relatives.

The monument to Cromwell in front of the parliament building sparked a fierce discussion about the "rewriting of history"
Cromwell’s “exile” would be a well-deserved retaliation for the barbaric destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace has inevitably arisen.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil War.
Oliver Cromwell probably suffers from the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived forever before.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornickroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, a monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate by specialists.
But one can say with certainty that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century affected the further development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be commended and respected.”
Chinese farmer bit a pig-killer to death
In one of the markets in southwestern China, a farmer became a victim of pigs, local media reports.
The victim's bloodied body (only his name is mentioned in the media, "yuan") with a ruptured artery was found near a barn in a market in the Lupaneshui district of Guizhou province in southern China. This was reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farm is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm, May 30, 2005, in Sinin District, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, a cousin discovered Yuan’s breathless body, and the door to the neighboring pig house was opened.
There was a huge hamster in the pigsty with blood on it.
During the forensic examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bleeding and mutilated,” Wu, a relative of the man’s, told Guiyang Evening News.
Video from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate squad during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
Attacks of pigs on humans are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal nailed a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let go, only frightened by his late wife.
In 2012, a case was reported when a farmer from Oregon, U.S., was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “trigger.”
Pigs are playful.
They are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just need to instill a sense of measure and respect in your animals,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to much of the southwest of the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing power as it moves through a cooler water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring rain and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of Saturday, at 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, located 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical moisture north of Mexico, to the territory of the southwestern United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical moisture falling into the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the South-West in the coming days.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rain floods, muddy streams and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, the rainfall rate can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour due to high tropical humidity.
In some parts of the southwestern United States, mostly in most parts of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be up to 5-10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapid flooding due to uneven distribution of tropical rainfall is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical rainfall, hiking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Livni can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can occasionally cause blazing winds and lift dust clouds.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone in places on the coast of southern California, the rains will fall.
Precipitation of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause small muddy streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings there will be tropical rains in Arizona, which will spread to other territories by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will pass in the area of the Four Corners and will last until the evening of Wednesday.
In October, there will be sharp temperature changes throughout the United States, due to the low temperatures in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to strong temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be particularly noticeable in the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between the temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and De Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. territories are expected to have warm weather in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees in the area from the South Plains to the Northeast of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast is likely to promise unusually high temperatures on the U.S. East Coast until mid-October.
The Senate hearings in the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh watched more than 20 million spectators
The performances of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazy Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, caught the attention of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels on Thursday.
The political confrontation around Kavanaugh’s candidacy has received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, the media received an urgent message: Republican Jeff Flake put a condition that the charges against the lawyer be investigated by the FBI within a week.
As Ford said at a hearing before the Senate Legal Committee, she is “100 percent sure” that Cavanaugh attacked her intoxicated and tried to strip her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to the Nielsen research agency, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of audiences of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison: this is an average audience watching a game of American football in a playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
The biggest audience was on Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: the Senate hearings, which lasted all day, averaged 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reports.
After hearings, interest in the case did not diminish.
On Friday, there was a real drama with Jeff Flake.
After an Arizona senator, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Kavanaugh’s candidacy, CNN and CBS were able to film how on Friday morning on the way to the Activist Activist Committee meeting, Flake stumbled into a stumbling block.
The whole world has seen him lowering his eyes and getting a buzz from angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one of them.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“Behind you is strength, while so many women are powerless,” the women tried to explain their position.
Flake responded to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at a committee meeting. The elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous chambers.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake put one condition on the FBI to investigate the allegations against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority was pursuing.
Flake claims he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Senator from the Democrats Chris Kunz.
He made the final decision by speaking to Kunz and several other senators.
Flake's decision took effect, as it was evident that the Republicans were lacking votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By President Trump’s decree, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of "political games" around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests ahead of public interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on the same page with May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shashka” plan within the framework of Brexit, saying that he considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wade Sims Death in Shooting: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson on Suspicion of Murdering Louisiana State University Forward
Police have arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges.
Police released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional channel CBS, police found Simpson's DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, a bond of $350,000 is set for Simpson.
The Eastern District Coroner of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary ruling on Friday that the death was caused by a cross-sectional gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisiana Police Criminal Investigation Department, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local residents who assisted in the conduct of the investigations that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked law enforcement for their “faithful work in capturing the criminal.”
Simsa was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the team at the University of Louisiana.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made an average of 2.6 selections per game.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying the tragic death of Wade Sims had caused "shock" and "real grief" for all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
The volcano covered with the ashes of Mexico City.
The Popocatepetl volcano incinerated the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended the population not to approach the volcano: activity was recorded in its crater and 183 gas-to-gas emissions were produced in a day.
According to the Center, there was often a thunder and a tremor near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users posted photos of the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash.
After a magnitude 7.1 Mw earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded the volcanic activity involved 72 km southeast of the capital.
The Popocatepetl volcano (or, for his own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona held a rally dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps. It was not without clashes between supporters of independence of the autonomy and the police; six participants of the riots were caught under
Police displaced the independence protesters, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw orderly guards with eggs and powder paint, lifting clouds of dark dust in the center of Barcelona.
After the police put in motion the poles to deter the crowd, the riots resumed with a new force.
For several hours, the independence supporters chanted: “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!”, and their opponents responded with a slogan: “Long live Spain!”.
According to local media reports, fourteen participants were taken to a hospital with minor injuries.
A referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain was held on 1 October last year. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government but has become an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions remain in the sovereign region.
Catalonia with a huge advantage voted to leave Spain, but attendance was low due to the fact that opponents of the exit predominantly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, last year almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes when police tried to block the holding of a referendum in the country’s polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists overnighted on the alleged path of following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from being held.
The demonstration took place, but took a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissos Termes, who attended a rally of separatists in the company of his wife, mourns that the hope of Catalonia's acquisition of sovereignty is becoming increasingly fragile.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying with joy, having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a state of suspension,” he says.
In the recent December local elections, Catalan parties advocating the separation from Spain have won an important victory, albeit with a small gap. However, this year their movement is losing supporters, as many of the movement's well-known leaders are either on the run or in detention.
Joan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a police rally over the phone, said the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine leaders of Catalan separatists since the end of last year in pre-trial detention, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Participating in the next European elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: car crashed into house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the homes in Londonberry was hit several times by a car; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested.
The raid was carried out on Thursday around 19:30 local time in the area of Ballinagard Crescent.
As a result, the gate and the building itself were damaged, according to criminal police inspector Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that the car could have been fired from an archer.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Mengi's goal
Dolly Mengi's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to Livingston
Thanks to the score, Livingston won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
The exact strike of Dolly Mengi equalized the team of Gary Holt with the Hibernian in the standings, where they share second place.
Gerrard's club was left without a win at the start of this season of the Premier League. On Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the group, the "Harts", from which the "Rangers" are behind by eight points.
On Thursday, the "Rangers" will hold on their field matches of the European League with the Austrian club "Rapid" (Vienna).
Livingston continues its winning-winning series in the division, having played six games and not received a single loss since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Lost moments for Livingston in a fight with hard-pressed guests
Holt’s coaches had to account from the start – the Rangers clearly did not cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not come out. Then defender Alan Litgou, swinging too wide, could not prevent the ball of Kaig Halkett to get into the grid.
The host side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers gave up a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who scored from a central position.
By that time, the Rangers had the upper hand in possession of the ball, but the defense of the host team was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued on the same schedule, although Kelly still had to beat Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball away from Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a wide run from the standard position.
The balls constantly fell into the penalty box of Livingston, but all attacks were reflected, and two penalties—one for provoking replacement player Glenn Middleton by Hulkett and the other for playing by hand—were not satisfied.
"Fenomenal" game "Livingston" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, a report from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympus.
Their style of play and composition have remained virtually unchanged since their rise to the top of the rankings, and the great merit of coach Holt is that he mobilized this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Hulkett led a superbly organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
The Rangers couldn’t get into the rhythm.
“Although they had some good game moments with coach Gerrard, this time they didn’t meet our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match they lacked possession of the ball, and to pass the defense of the host team they managed only once. "Rangers", descended to the middle of the table, there is something to think about.
Receiving Erdogan during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was great, and the two top figures were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany with the aim of establishing relations between the two NATO countries – a visit, already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find an understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a crowd of 25,000 to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan were located nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn in full both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous essence of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalt Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Car Collision Leads to Bicyclist’s Death
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The crash occurred near Westwood Street and Evelyn Street, a lively junction in the southeastern part of the city of Depfort, around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was shot down by a car whose driver hid.
London police say work is currently underway to identify the deceased and inform his or her closest relatives.
Meanwhile, at the scene of the accident, roads are blocked and the route of the buses has been changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Unrest in Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured
According to the Long Lattine administration, six police officers were injured in the riots in the men's prison.
The men's prison of the strict regime of Long Lartin (Wustershire) since Sunday, the riots began at about 09:30 local time.
To suppress the unrest involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado group was called up.
The police received minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided with medical care on the spot.
According to the prison official, “specially trained staff were recruited to solve the incident in the Long-Lartine correctional facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is obvious that the culprits will be handed over to the police and their detention measure may be changed for a longer period of time.”
Long Lartine currently holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the jail manager had been hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October of last year, the prison leadership was forced to recruit special forces to reassure the insurgent prisoners who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which will benefit arid areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of passage of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time she is “lucky”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last burst, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of rainy floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of rainfall on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Phoenix.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over the Phoenix on Tuesday and will pour rain on Monday evening.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said on Twitter that “a total of ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status, being within a radius of 320 km of the Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, it will rain from 5 to 10 cm, sometimes reaching 15 cm on the Arizona plateau of Mogollon-Rome.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, precipitation of up to 2.5–5 cm is possible, in places of precipitation can reach 10 cm.
For areas where rains will pass by, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although rainy floods can pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the drought season not taking place in the Southwestern United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is experiencing at least severe drought (the second most severe category).”
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, whose maximum speed is 137 km/h, is located 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has found itself in a cooler water zone on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of "tropical storm".
It is expected that in some areas of Mexico there will be abundant rainfall with the threat of flooding.
“On the territory from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, it can rain up to 7-10 cm, places up to 25 cm,” the weather.com website reports.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the border with Arizona in the category of tropical cyclone. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is associated with heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and desert areas of the southwestern United States,” the National Meteorological Service said in a statement.
Precipitation is expected to cause hazardous floods, muddy flows in the desert, and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Arrested in Murder Attempt
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager was seriously wounded by a knife. Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim of the attack with serious injuries was found in the Exelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
Four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area on the same evening, Avon and Somerset county police said.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime, possessing any videos of what happened on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the anger of the Democrats has fallen on Kavanaugh”
“The voice behind Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally of his associates in Willing, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of acknowledging Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate, “all the hatred, all the anger” of the Democratic Party has collapsed.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address categorically dismissing the accusation of Christina Blazy Ford that he sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her allegations.
On Saturday, the US president said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class, and courage” of Cavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s approval is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unblemished state record,” the president told a crowd of his associates in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly raised the question of Kavanaugh’s nomination, talking about the importance of Republicans’ participation in elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“The most important election in our lives is only five weeks away.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in another sense,” he said.
"I'm wearing a burnt-out and fighting for our great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves the task of “resisting us with all their might.”
According to the regulations, the first key vote in the Senate to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy should take place no later than Friday, said an assistant senior Republican Party representative.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people were killed, many of them by giant waves, capturing the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible force of tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the element were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday at sunset, the coast reached waves of almost six meters high, which dared everyone on their way and led to the immediate death of many of those present.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When yesterday a storm warning was announced, people continued their beach vacation, instead of immediately running to shelter, and because of this they lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Office for Images.
"The tsunami did not come one thing, there were cars, wood, whole houses in the water, the element destroyed everything in its path," Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and crashed with all its strength on the coast.
Some of the attendees took to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 locals were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
In the aerial photography of the disaster management, destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque are visible.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by subterranean thrusts.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
A statement from the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the energy emission caused by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than in the explosion of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho said the damage was "large-scale", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Palu, in the town of Dongdala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with the Dongkal were "completely destroyed, no information received".
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area of Dongkal,” the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already headed to the disaster zone, said in a statement.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized for failing to report the tsunami to Palu in time, but authorities believe the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, an amateur video appeared in which a man on the upper floor of the building shouts about the tsunami approaching, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes, the wall of water collapses on the shore, bringing with it entire houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet confirmed the authorship of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a major depletion of electrical lines, which caused a loss of communication in Palu. This greatly hindered the rescue operations of the services.
Military transport aircraft with humanitarian assistance have been dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population is still lacking food and essentials, government sources say.
The city’s airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungala in Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents broken down in the yard of their office building. According to Doceba Sinai, on the road they saw a horrific picture of complete destruction.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to get to Palu.
Indonesian law allows for the involvement of funding, humanitarian aid and staff from foreign organizations only after the location of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is believed to be a local disaster,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government declares a natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Palu, the friends and relatives of the people who are missing still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the population's faith in the best.
On Saturday, a small boy who fell into a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from under the debris of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother's breathless body.
Gendo Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team for paragliding, prepared two of the missing pilots for the recently held in Indonesia Asian Games.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel included his students, including Mandaga.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Gendon recalls how, after hearing about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel from other paragliders, he tried desperately to get in touch via WhatsApp with his colleagues from Palu, who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray check mark, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he believes.
Bold theft of $26,750 during ATM service in Newport-on-Levy
On Friday morning, hackers stole $26,750 from Brink's cashier, who is filling one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Livy, according to a press release from the Newport police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex, and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
During this time, “an attacker ran to Brink’s employee from behind” and stole a bag of banknotes to fill the ATM.
According to witnesses, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not specify the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West invented a new name: Yee.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news of this appeared on the eve of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as co-host instead of singer Ariana, who has cancelled her participation due to “emotional experiences,” the author of the show reports.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of its name, but also carries with it a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’, ‘you’,” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
“I mean, it’s you, it’s us.
At first there was Kanye, which means “only”, and now I am only Ye, that is, the reflection of all good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye was not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy or simply Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Brother Love" or "Brother Love").
The West rapper Jay-Z also changed the spelling of his name several times: with and without deficiencies, spellings or strings.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to resort to military force against civilians on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people. This was taking place against the background of the strengthening of leftist student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also pledged to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open more free state universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects of education bring young people directly into the criminal world.
The U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
China and its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts should not be underestimated – the US should double its investment in its research, says Lee Kaifu, an AI investor and entrepreneur with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Previously, several U.S. departments have made statements on AI, although the U.S. as a whole does not have a clear AI development strategy.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Twice the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we expect the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Increasing funding twice could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most outstanding AI+ companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that surpassed the highest player in American Othello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese affiliate Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Li is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States develop artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China provides scientists with funding similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would settle a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments concluded an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum.
The question raised in a referendum was: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievskaya, a resident of Skopje.
Sufficient members of parliament said they would abide by the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it does not have binding legal force.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The State Election Commission said no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the question of changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene, placing chairs in front of tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, rather than exceeding the thresholds of official cabinets,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-worth.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring investments to Macedonia, which is so much needed in this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a guarantee of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but that is below the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it was found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of those respondents said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to take place, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguaro of Manchester City bypasses the defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling dealt with Brighton's defense, leading Manchester City to a 2:0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it didn’t seem to be a problem for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He ran between the three Brighton defenders before breaking out into open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and overtook several others along the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, while in the penalty zone, in one touch returned the ball Aguaro, who with his right foot punched goalkeeper "Brighton" Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the goal.
“Aguaro is having some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguaro got the ball, being deep in the territory of the "Brighton"
He gave an excellent cut-off on the left flank on Leroy Sane.
Sane made several touches before handing over Sterling to the long rod.
The Sky Blue striker scored the ball into the goal just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City faced Hofenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhine Neckar Arena in Zinnheim, Germany.
Sharzer is going to take the glasses from the Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals got out of the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force the event.
But the relentless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of one game of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, start problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7th or 8th place, but they are still hoping to secure a title in the first division.
“Although we play just like that, at least we can hold our positions knowing the tremendous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of spectators and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the pitcher on Sunday, but according to the latest data, in the current situation, they tend to expose Sherzer to this role.
Sharzer, who is going to go to the 34th game, on Thursday threw the ball on the pitch for the pitchers, and on Sunday, on his weekend, will be a pitcher.
Washington's right-footed statistic is 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running an election race in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, a candidacy nominated by the president to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s very, very important. I don’t run, although I really run, fighting everywhere for good candidates,” he said.
“You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by any means necessary, and we observe vileness and disgust.
They don’t care who they offend, through whom they must pass to get power and control, which is what they want to get – power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he says, have set themselves the goal of “resisting and hindering.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil, vile, nasty and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, citing Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud noises from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the contents of this document?
Mmm... mmm... what kind of paperwork?
No, no. The language of the body gave it out, I have never seen the language of the body so refute words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization that holds different views.
She does not show tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of no confidence in me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of MPs from the Labour Party who have not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our opinion.
The same is true of my colleague in parliament, Joanne Ryan, because she has spoken out strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, a vote of no-confidence criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe — ironically, fate — are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice on the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years of my tenure as a local MP from the Labour Party, the GC’s Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that differences of opinion are not allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader; colleagues whose political outlook I previously considered to be similar to mine began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions that I would never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every time after my public speech – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a tyranny of insults on social media calling for elections to be cancelled, condemning the centre’s policies, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never back down.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that this amount of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that “wide church,” and with every vote of distrust or change in the rules of choice the party becomes already.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations urging me to sit down and speak quietly, and then I will be all right.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil of a school indignant at the government’s scornful attitude that has literally disintegrated my school class, I’ve been striving to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most, whether it’s the work of a government minister or a local deputy.
I never hid my political views, I never did it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is struggling to move towards Brexit, which is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, and my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to cancel the results of the election or political expediency will interfere with me.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air gets first place
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but no doubt the Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match.
Now they lead the table, the only invincible team of dozens.
After all, all thanks to their excellent protection, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Mercy full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested for strength all this time, and we’re still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” Mercy said.
Robin Christie, Melrose: “It’s worth paying tribute to Air, they’ve tried better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, made by Fraser Clima, brought the Air forward, but a yellow card issued for the Warriors to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed the Melrose to go forward, and Jason Buggot grabbed the lead.
Climate increased the gap of the "Air" from the penalty, before, right in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then in a break made a single attempt, making a score of 17-5 in favor of the "Air".
But the Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, made by Baggot, shortened the gap to five points.
There was then a long pause due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who had been stretched, and after the re-release, the "Air" moved on thanks to the attempt by Stafford McDowell, realized by Clima.
Acting Air captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again the Melroses forced the rivals to pay the next player for Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt at the end of the period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Stryan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climax without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the incoming Air Mall.
Climate realised the advantage by not stopping almost from the very re-release, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme striker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the owners of the field.
The star of Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiran is about to start working in the hotel industry: it has become known that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script for which he writes, and is filmed together with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last on the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan plans to participate in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: Bolivia’s landlocked hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are delineated with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to bring it back.”
Across Bolivia, landlocked, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to resources; alive and eager to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may have been the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the mental balance and, of course, there is a positive result,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision process at the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be able to support Bolivia’s statement that, after decades of tense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who is fighting a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also eagerly awaiting a decision to be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already said it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was made only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, the case of Bolivia has not progressed, but on the contrary has been postponed all the time.
“The current administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, Morales’ belligerent rhetoric destroyed Chile’s last benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court’s decision was made too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he says.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the naval problem as a political scam.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to make sure once again that we have to step through our past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming stalemate nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The dream that the long-running sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington fears approving the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest line of massive headwear that promises to appear on mass sales and will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there’s no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a host of unusual headwear that is part of their SS19 collection and has blinded visitors to the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats gained popularity among Instagram subscribers, and the designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
A distinguished example of Valentino: a beige headdress, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, adorned the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included jeweled watermelon, wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all of these headwear are not designed to warm your head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of bizarre masks, which had to happen very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had a mouth sewn on them, and they resembled Hannibal Lector’s portrait more than the creation of couturiers.
One of the specimens resembled underwater equipment with a tube and protective glasses, and the other was melting ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to break into mass sales – right to you.
Huge hats go along the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with fields two feet wide, which was worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The iconic label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which has won such wide popularity on social networks, gave birth and sent to walk on the podium another huge accessory - straw beach bag, almost as big as the model, the suku, which is dressed in a cup.
An orange bag made of burnt raffia with a white leather handle and a raffia rim has become a bright example of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale next summer. Since the designer has produced such furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge axes".
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was confirmed once again in 2018: outstanding exam results demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are educated throughout Scotland, aiming to provide the highest level of services to students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector that is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you turn to his heart.”
This is a convincing proof that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages occupy the leading positions in the league tables and have the highest score on the results of the exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade "A".
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese pronunciation), while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are now in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employers struggled to fill vacancies were a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require knowledge of languages, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession the student will choose, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will benefit him throughout his further life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage, with 15 percent of the respondents speaking it.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland there is a fairly large disparity in terms of the languages that are taught - each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in light of the country’s future development by 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teaching staff, whose members are experts in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland strive to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future awaits them.
At present, there is no denying that languages remain vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country and should therefore be appropriately reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it.
John Edwards, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The long wait for fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday game against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers chart.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare for the season," he said.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned meetings next week, including a friendly visit to Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his nomination for the top judge has been postponed, Trump is seeking support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time will Trump meet in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
A meeting with Trump in Willing, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with voters in West Virginia online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearings to be held this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the position of Supreme Judge. Trump's proposal for this candidacy has caused a lot of negative reactions, as Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was to be held in the Senate, will be suspended.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans who are going to the November election increase the electoral pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign aims to ensure that these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help “activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a tense season of campaign agitation,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be named.
The action scheduled today at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing may attract supporters from “...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the media attention of Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is his second visit to the state in the past month, because it is here that he received an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“The fact that Morrissey has to be ahead of his competitors in the polls is a bad sign for Morrissey himself,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team demonstrates willingness to fight and gives hope by going on Sunday to a pairs competition
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transitional initiative is an exceptionally invented sports concept, but it is in it that the players believe, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point lead, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” Jordan said.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve on the cone.
The Americans feel the “wind in the sails,” and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least thanks to the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and everyone can boast of three points out of four.
Sleep was inflexible from you to the grin, as given by a personal example.
The victorious shouts became louder as his round continued, shoving the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas gave up two by two.
His blow, which gave them victory in the game at the 15th hole, was met with a similar shout, one of those who speak of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all our strength and focus only on our own game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go through 18 holes and become the winners.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly made history in the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe has kicked out four out of four, and it seems they don’t know the mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple not to score boggs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boggs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
The series and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the unsuspecting fans, strengthens the belief that on Sunday they will not win, and when the sun will hide behind the horizon of the field "Le Golf National", there will be no more famous player who has secured the potential victory of the Euro.
It would be great if they were both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
The boggs and the two double boggs in the first nine holes dug a pit for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
It’s so exciting to watch a four-ball and four-player game because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange and what they deliberately keep silent, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has made a significant breakthrough in the last day, but this four-day session has also shown that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday’s four-ball and four-four matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over fighting Tiger Woods to bring the score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Björn, wishing to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team’s mistake in the morning games in four balls, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the gap in the score.
Jim Ferrick’s team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday games to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then teamed up brilliantly to defeat fallen spirit Woods and American rookie Bryson Decebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday games, showed periodic flashes, but now he has lost 19 of 29 games in four balls and four in seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the morning game of four balls, returned to teammate Henrik Stanson in the fourth, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a 2/1 score, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant day refreshing walk to the south-west of Paris.
Earned by three-time champions Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a benchmark for the Americans.
They earned a decisive 2/1 win over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in the four-ball game and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McKilroy by 4/3 in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history did the team come out of a four-point lag, leaving alone, given that Ferik's team, as the hosts, had to play down to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding the second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will "categorically" not disarm unilaterally without confidence
The North’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were heightening mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea took “substantial measures of goodwill” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear site, and a commitment not to build up stockpiles of nuclear weapons and not to develop nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to take unilateral action on disarmament.
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not dismiss the unilateral denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start a security move towards the “denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must be carried out first,’ and increases the level of pressure through sanctions in order to enforce its goal, and even objects to ‘announcing the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are heightening our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the side of this denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in place.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech drastically differed from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide missile.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was much more to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not specify any deadlines for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and compulsory until we see a complete, definitive and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes "appropriate action" on its part.
Kim said the "appropriate measures" he spoke of were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest on Special Courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all elementary school students learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to wake up “at night in the spring.”
One of the academics found that the world’s most successful students often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he embarked on the idea of introducing such a course by presenting a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, ‘It’s a pity that I only learned about it now that I’m almost finishing my studies.’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of the lesson, an image of a room in a dormitory is offered, where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, exercisers and books, get information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which both cause a lack of sleep — affect the number of sports results, and how important it is to get.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages course participants to reflect on their daily life.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, like any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects their health,” Chassler said.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “walk all night” is still widespread enough, and modern technology, as well as increasing pressure on students, means that sleep deprivation becomes a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a “secret weapon” for the student to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, as insomnia translates the brain into a mode of starvation, causing him to constantly experience a feeling of hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop the course by attending one of the classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to undergo a similar curriculum before enrolling in a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students install an alarm clock that warns you that you need to go to bed and wake up, as well as remember the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts the human biorhythm and leads to problems with sleepiness.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers went through another sad outing as Dolly Menga's goal led the uncollected team of Stephen Gerrard to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped to win their first away win after a 4–1 win in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their wits, did not seem to be going to equalize the score.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, Livingston rose to third place, and only outperformed the Hibernian in the ratio of goals scored.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after Linear Judge Calum Spence had to heal a head wound after some item was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that passed through the Air in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with the same Livy 11 strategy, which increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be delighted to see how his well-managed squad squeezed opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have led in the possession of the sword, but the Livingston were pushed far more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes when Allan McGregor stopped the first transmission of Menga to Scott Pittman, but the midfielder took advantage of the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs made a penalty shot at team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Litgow, only managed to send the ball to the far rod.
The Rangers have taken control, but in the last third there seems to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident he had to hit a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made only two hits in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly worried about Lassan Kulibali’s headstroke, and Ovi Ejariya’s weak blow.
Although Livy’s first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they earned it solely by their own labor.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to hand the ball over to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began acting in the break when he replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately yielded a result when the extreme midfielder gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into the game they had planned with Litgow and Hulkett, constantly making long-running shows.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
Reserve Rangers player Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger's Counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger’s counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Coronado Bell, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — seemingly not like scientists — in the mainstream.
Man: “What kind of thing is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Look, you can hear it right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the therapeutic effect of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result, the cells get the ability to “see” the type of protein characteristic of many cancers, then the cells have to be re-conducted.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who received the vaccine and whose immune system learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and alter them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, then the modified cells are re-injected to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Wifezda, Maryland, says: “The results we’ve obtained suggest we’ve got a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted of removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in a MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
It went badly.
Kanye West was sworn in at the studio during a Saturday concert where he spoke out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he would re-take the position in 2020.
After performing his third song titled "Ghost City", performing which he wore the cap "Make America Great Again", the performer gave a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“Very often I talk to white people and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL made a parody show starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blaise Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
On television, it was not shown how the crowd was upset by West's statement, but the video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock tried to make West laugh with that move.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes his hat was ridiculed.
“They were teasing me behind the scenes.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really teasing me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “And they also said that my position was not cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a superman’s coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments have attracted the attention of the audience at least twice, the cast of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication, "The whole studio has sunk into silence."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
Many were puzzled by West’s performance of “I Love It” in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT OF MANY.”
Lead talk show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing, or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and Pippi Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lion, and as another example, of course, we can cite the performer, who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as the "Prince".
Attempted murder charge for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of knife wounds at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihakamora, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is attacking toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the sword-swinging John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, recently, the 31-year-old actor has fiercely criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such characters often instill in young people the idea that in order to be respected, you must necessarily be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The whale, who recently married his colleague in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he was "very indifferent" to the problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach young people that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes television may be partly to blame for this surge of toxic masculinity due to too muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
Why is it being taught on television and in the streets that makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is how can we change that?
Because nowadays, with young people, something is really wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, saying he had "finished battles and horses."
From November, Keith will play the lead role in the re-released True West by Sam Shepard, telling about the film's producer and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones final for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played Igryst, the subject of Keith Snow's passion in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was practically reduced to zero by this route, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 every year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies information leak on Republican senators’ fault, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The L.A. Democrat claims that the lawsuits were forged by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more vicious lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to the Waters office, and released information about Waters employees, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie.”
Waters’ statement promptly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flaescher.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleisher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
There is no need to justify either.
And you shouldn't dig into the motives of the prosecutors either.
We have to stay calm and cold.”
Flacher seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In her statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent actions.
“We will make sure that criminals are found and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous for everyone and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again – a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain appears in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise "Agent Johnny English", the production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film "Agent Johnny English".
Will the self-ironic picture with the leitmotif “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the eye-catching Johnny English with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time - this is his name most vividly suggests that he is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to glamorous smudge, received some Clouseau, Mr. Bean’s traits, and a portion of this guy who contributed one single note to the melody of Chariots of Fire in London at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
Originally, this character was created based on the identity of the traveler and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves complete chaos behind.
In this latest release, JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the shovels leaned over his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because such “serious” film rehearsals as “Agent 007” and “Mission Unfeasible” now confidently offer comedy as an element.
The feeling that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English’s bizarre mishaps are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson’s jokes in Mr. Bine’s films.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the on-call agent — Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, a busy and stubborn figure already suffering from huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for the character of Quasi Theresa May, but in the script there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And here on the stage is the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in some bridge institution, but also gives informal lessons of secret operational work: here are a few good jokes, as English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of "rock".
English returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former unlucky friend Buff, who is also played by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who obeys the captain of the submarine - the role of "fun hockey sticks", in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because there have been terrible mistakes in the secret service of Her Majesty. They are faced with a beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bullet performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems - the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farcical jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht Volta; English generates total anarchy, trying to use the intercoms of virtual reality.
All these scenes, of course, are a cute and insidious invention, but there is something quite childish about it.
Quite moderate things.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s really proportional to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of the British to four days for a five-day salary
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give the savings earned by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers, giving them an extra break.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources said that the idea "fits" into the party's economic agenda and will help the country's population to stand on the side of the workers.
The trade union congress has approved a transition to a four-day working week so workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to changing the balance sheet in the economy in favor of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Greens promised a four-day working week even during their 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour conference last week to concrete his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to tear power away from “faceless directors” and “speculators” of utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government can make “calculations” based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private sector firms’ capital to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John F. Kennedy say ‘60 minutes’ if FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham to see if the FBI could find anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the meeting, I said that I was talking to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information popped up, I asked, “Did you do that?”
His response was decisive, definite and unambiguous.”
But Graham’s opinion in the vote remained unchanged.
"I've made a firm decision about Brett Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, in the strength of action comparable to that of dynamite," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said.
“None of the people she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
This story has been going on for 36 years.
I didn’t notice anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce the level of poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music event attended by an impressive cast with an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year of the Citizens of the World Festival, tens of thousands of people flock to the large lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to tell about the real purpose of the event.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of a global anti-poverty project led by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you’re not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), you’d have to volunteer or email a world leader, make a phone call, or take any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal.
But how successful has the Citizens of the World Festival been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people by freely attending a concert really convincing fellow citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers say that since 2011, the festival has recorded more than 19 million “actions” carried out by its supporters, who pursue a variety of different goals.
As a result of these actions, world leaders have pledged to allocate more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a UK partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children fully unleash their potential”, promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the district. This was done by more Citiz.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a social injustice with regard to malnutrition past history,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to urge the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “Food Force” project, which will cover 5 million women and children through nutrition-enhancing activities.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the festival’s website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen organizers respond: “It will be a long and difficult journey that we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But, as in the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanel Monet – here are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, with Deborah-Lee Fernandes and Hugh Jackman as their hosts.
U.S. could use navy for “blockade” to prevent Russian energy exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to the help of its navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy the way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, the blockade, so that their energy does not enter the market,” the minister said.
Zinke addressed the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He further compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister said, calling Russia a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came in connection with the Trump administration’s task of increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, offering a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream-2 project, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position has provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the name of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third state interferes with our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider the possibility of running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would carefully consider the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the city duma in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and ‘fix’ our broken government, and ‘on top’ they need a woman,” Warren said.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s actions during the meeting: “It’s leading this district in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump himself and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we start voting.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that Warren’s majority does not think she should run for office in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The poll showed that the population is more supportive of former governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent support his possible participation in the election, and 48 percent oppose it.
Other well-known names of Democrats that have been discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder Trac Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump voters
Track Palin, 26, who joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experience as other family members suffering the consequences of PTSD and having injuries, and our soldiers are returning with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tallahassee, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "blind in the eye" and said of his son and other war veterans: "they are already returning by others, hardened, wondering if their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military is the same respect they have for their country."
Trak Palin was arrested Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman for interfering in the violence and possession of weapons in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wassila police department.
18 states in the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of fleeing or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday from a court adviser on support for an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the “Grace v. Sessions” lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, consisting of a criminal group,” had abused her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace-supporting states say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing large numbers of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision taken by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racin said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court adviser said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that policies banning immigrants harm the U.S. economy, emphasizing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
"Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political belief," Sashns said in a statement.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusum’s mother, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances bring in the injured.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwayne Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, rested near the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were being treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to continued strong pushes.
He weeps, remembering how a strong earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor that he shot with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was stuck in the debris of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they’re safe and that they’re okay now.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Attacks’ Through ‘Propaganda Advertising’
A week after one of China’s official newspapers published a four-page ad in the US daily newspaper describing the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid addition to the Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa’s largest commercial newspaper, as accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections that will take place on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of what U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China is coming.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalating trade war, as a result of which they equate tariffs on their countries’ imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, says Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government dearly cherishes our American tradition of free speech and free press by paying for and posting advertisements on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, in the newspaper kiosks here on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear dissenting voices and you will not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could get acquainted with when they learn about China’s alarming economic policy, because the local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party,” he said.
He also added that one of China’s best-known newspapers “smartly dismissed” the offer to publish his article, although it did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: by disseminating Kavanaugh Republicans push away women-voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction here, especially from the choice of women, which may affect the upcoming ones.
The emotion around this situation has gone to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to such things later,” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s attempts to conduct an FBI investigation at the very last minute will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in front of the Senate, when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blacey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” said non-party political scientist Stu Rotenberg.
“People say that the situation has already gotten pretty hot, and that’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of suburban female voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Court candidate, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could trigger a backlash.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench of the defendants, it’s how Republicans deal with it, how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to trust anyway – Ford or Cavanaugh, and a little more leaning on the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony accurately or likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh’s testimony accurately or likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Cavanaugh most likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, under oath, Ford testified to the Senate Legal Committee that Cavanaugh, while intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data stores” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, tasks, as well as a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools for dealing with data.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online storage is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “the personal empowerment through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers with whom it has contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his company is worth making drastic changes that will change all of their business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in the debate over net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Churchman awarded with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918, for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglis and Leucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial to this event was solemnly opened by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the Saint-Canten Canal "in a very thick fog and under the strong fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later he threw himself on the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led the group forward, and then with one hand dropped the field gun, defeating the three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that "he would hardly have been able to do the same heroically, but that's humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath at the end of the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the virtue of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be provided by many people.”
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead showed them the Pippa pig
Imagine that you haven’t slept all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you haven’t been allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six main program fights, the fights were broadcast all night live on UK TV channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, fans in Britain were stunned to see Pippa the Pig on the screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change from broadcasting to a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke."
“There was a government ruling that for 6 o’clock in the morning this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pig Peppa."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they plan to schedule the fights in a way that will also allow viewers from the UK to watch in the future.
“As for the re-show, I think we can resolve this issue,” Cocker says.
“But there is Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to resolve this issue until Sunday in our time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we will do our utmost.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a bunch of text messages spilled over, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise that next time that won’t happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we are trying to increase that number, but it has turned out to be too much.
Yeah, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that’s what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not realize that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics started worrying him less after he had a baby.
The permanent host of the multi-year show Kirsty Young because of the illness took a vacation for several months.
Daley, who played the lead guest on Laverne's show, said he felt "more insignificant than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both boys and girls.
“To this day,” he says, “these feelings of insignificance and irrelevance have been quite real, but they have given me strength and I have succeeded.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something meant” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and, in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, urged countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “surprised him.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference has never been a problem.
“If there’s so much going on in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find a peer who would have had the same drastically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said “his whole worldview” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“But you know what, there are things more important than gold Olympic medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not want to put up with the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was for first-line tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he wasn’t invincible,” the athlete says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to pick his first favorite song – Proud by Heather Small – that helped him prepare for the Olympics and still loves him so much.

Michelson, who is not in shape, spent this Saturday the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday after playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to tighten his form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played at the Biennale for the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furrick on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as has often been the case in the United States, a five-time major winner has divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of fixing what is troubling him.
Never having had the most direct shot, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not the perfect candidate for a tough run at Le Golf National, where a long raft usually penalizes for inaccurate shots.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson in the ninth match on Sunday will face the exact champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a furious start, Michelson’s match could be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, although what else could he have said.
“He fully understood the role that was given to him today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” he said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He’s a walking Hall of Fame, and he’s done so much for these teams both last week and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that’s how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michelson will break Nick Foldo's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Ferik said his presence has brought a lot of benefit to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to get people in the way, and he’s a great guy to be interesting with,” he explained.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week and it was interesting to watch.
His game is much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Björn knows that the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant single-tier leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn to the disadvantage.
The Dutchman made his debut in a 1997 match in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only slightly ahead of the finish line with the smallest 13<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 points.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in the 10th at Walderram; we had a big advantage in the 5th at Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Walderram, where we won, but only so far,” said Björn, who was shot in the photo, after viewing the 5th at the 2018 class, you’ve got a big advantage in the 5th.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be in full swing.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as the glasses are not on the board, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win a trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I have spoken without being silent, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that we are against the greatest players in the world.
Satisfied with how his players performed on an uncomfortable golf course for them, Bjorn added: "I would never have surpassed myself in this.
Tomorrow we will face a different test.
Individual speeches start tomorrow, and that’s a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you’re alone there, you’re testing all your professional golfer’s strengths.
This is the idea that players need to insinuate in order to get themselves to the full tomorrow.
Now the partner is behind, and he has to do his best, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will perform better individually than their partners, except for Jordan Spitz and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Feric himself went through all this carousel in the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before finally losing when Europe held the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought his players together before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish all this faster, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up as we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we’ll try to make a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McKilroy in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rame, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the table.
"I chose this group of guys, and in that order, because I think that way they will cover all the possible shortcomings," Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship is postponed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet was due to be put into service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War war warships, but this will not happen even less next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost increases, local media reported.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery made the fate of the ambitious project more difficult.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies – such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – there should be an opportunity to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, are already obsolete by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated frigate F125 hit the news headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in battle.
The software shortcomings were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to implement upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of anchoring the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the naval forces are in fact “lacking a supply of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said the problem had exacerbated over time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but ships had not been provided for replacement.
He claimed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be taken up by the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at a site in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the obtained data will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and help in further activities on the conservation of the species.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland, will examine the common bats, soprano bats, as well as the brown long-haired bats and bats of Dobanton, inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at certain points around the site to track the actions of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities that are responsible for the different groups of these animals.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the main areas of work on habitat management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forest massifs in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are in danger of disappearing due to construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose a danger, as well as adhesive tape for flies, chemical processing of building materials and hunting domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles along the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat population issues very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, exit checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threave is a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a prosperous existence.”
It reminds of the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within private properties, as the unintentional destruction of one nest can result in the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation officer, is calling on the public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of their individual species live,” she says.
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape against him, calling them “fake news” and arguing that people simply “want to get wasted” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published charges against the footballer.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video in which the footballer has 142 million followers, a few hours after the report of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said today is all fake news,” claims five-time Ballon d’Or winner on camera.
“They just want to get away with using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's just part of their job.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for charges they called “inadmissible information on confidentiality suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Herz said the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damages corresponding to the severity of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy, but one percent a bad guy."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of being revenged” and feared “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer switched to Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'would regret carmakers lost forever'
Business and Entrepreneurship Minister Greg Clark said Britain would “regret it forever” if it loses its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s Managing Director in Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the fact that, according to the automakers, in the absence of a deal in the framework of Brexit supply chains will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line starts “on time” and parts for custom-made cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be failures at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and spare parts shortages.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May’s plan, voiced at the Chekers, for future relations with the EU “is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to conclude a better deal, which will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 program “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are saying that we should absolutely be able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to specify how long production will be stopped, but has warned in the longer term that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Zuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s trade union, says that the concerns of the organization’s members are growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to get them back.”
The government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “deferred to another week” as the fight for Brett Cavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of Supreme Judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice on the part of the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has sparked a lot of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
However, on Monday he went to the White House allegedly in order to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blaise Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints about Cavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, maybe this week, and maybe it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists have disputed this claim: Sanders has not held briefings in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace wondered why he did it.
Sanders says the absence of briefings is not caused by the television reporter's "disregard for the community", although she added: "I will not deny that they play for the public."
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings by answering questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without giving the exact figures: “We have those numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would still be held, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We’re trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the president of the United States, it’s a worthy replacement for the press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions, leaving the White House, attending open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The president’s voluntarily, and sometimes oddly, behavior in front of journalists in New York this week may be the answer to why.
Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter about concerns about Brexit
The health minister appealed to EU officials working in Scotland’s GHS to express gratitude for the country’s wealth and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, addressed the letter to employees less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of filing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and this autumn an expected decision must be made.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible non-trade scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, right now, I want to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee midfielder Christian Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers suffered an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after losing 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodore.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just crashed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/degree of injury yet,” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who was only in second grade, this was his first season with Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, totaling 18 balls per season.

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless - this will be announced today by Theresa May.
This move will nullify the results of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters, which promises to make housing more affordable and increase citizens’ incomes.
The increase in the coat of arms fee will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds thus earned should stimulate the government's efforts to help homeless citizens.
The supplement to the existing coat of arms levy, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this step to save up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are purchased by non-British residents, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for buyers who purchase their first home to improve their housing conditions later on.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of squeezing real estate prices by buying land, but not actually using it, and urged Ms. May to give up affordable housing quotas to remedy the “disgraceful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include controlling rents and ending unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with every new generation.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not British citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own home has become too far away, and the threat of being on the street for some is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the revival of the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separated from the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got the B hat, and that’s it,” Ross told Sportssound BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child with my father, and it always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will only arise if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland managers were also Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poiet and Paulo Di Caño.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he hasn’t been intimidated by such reputable names in such major clubs, having previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In terms of its structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” the coach said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him out there, but I’ll think I’ve done my job only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, first becoming an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and the following season took St Mirren from the bottom to the championship winners.
Ross says he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management is better for me than a game.
That sounds strange because I did everything well, earned a good job and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I still feel stressed at work, but I feel good as a manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, doing so, I feel most comfortable like a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”

According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for a pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but lowered sales in restaurants chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting company, which received the statistics, says: “Long solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup means that July continued the trend of the previous month, while in June, when the sales in the pubs were up 2, the restaurants were up.
The June revenue drop in restaurant trade of 1.8% continued also in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results comparable in restaurants.
Pubs that only sell food are also affected by the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out on the street just to miss a glass.
Sales of beverages in pubs and bars grew by 6.6% in a month, and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for leisure and hotel business, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 percent drop in annual sales will be particularly painful due to ongoing price pressure.
A long, hot summer has never been more convenient for food operators, and it’s not yet the fact that August, bringing more temperate temperatures, will give the much-needed respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand declines.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 networks with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some of them only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of pages "fake instas"
The news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” account that their parents know about
However, one in five children, some of them only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake "insty" accounts - i.e. Instagram, a website for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a basic, “clean” account that their parents have access to, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, stumbled upon a teenager there who urged others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles on social networks, with half of them admitting that one of them is typically secretive.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan says, “Many teens are looking to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a worrying fact.”
Eileed Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileed Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most-titled athlete in athletics. Chairman Ian Bitty says this step is a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to take advantage of the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilid has tremendous respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that her participation will bring a huge benefit to athletics in Scotland,” said Betty.
Doyle said: “I am aspiring to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I will be able to really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC, after suffering a stroke lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Advertisement of a milk sucker, in which nursing mothers were compared to cows, shared the opinions of Internet users
A dairy company has sparked controversy on the Internet by posting an advertisement there that compares breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
Launching the world’s “first silent breast milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad music video that demonstrates the freedom the new milk pump provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in the haystack under the music track, which contains the words: "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And the choir continued: “We chew, chew, we feed our babies with breast milk, chew, chew.”
This commercial, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received a mixed reaction from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them for a few days after birth.”
Milk pump Elvie dresses directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is clear that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk suction for mothers who keep their children?”
Another user adds: “Advertising that is detached from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song "just magnificent".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was feeding a baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, of course, but that’s how it feels.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “The fun ads designed for mothers who are breastfeeding (often they do it right at their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, indeed, feel a little bit like ‘cows.’”
This advertising is not to praise or slander our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all danced with these invisible milk suckers hidden under bra.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk pump is completely insensitive, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding bra, and is imperceptible, giving women the ability to move, hold babies, and even go outside while feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and child early development specialist at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s milk pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By paralleling women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk suction gives.
This is not the first time Elvie has been featured in the news.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Yakubovskaya, using this product for her intended purpose.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children at trustees.
Typically, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking a child on bail.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested bail on unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously convicted.
“About 80 per cent of those who are either guarantors or members of their families are illegally in the country, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
That’s why we continue to persecute these people,” Albens said.
According to shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of registering children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, as was the case before.
To declare their legal status to an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those who are considered not entitled to assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that if you transport children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or say goodbye to friends, it can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders “occupation forces” of US, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "treated accordingly".
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the assembled.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been driven from their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “conduct this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Muallem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “propagating irrational fears” that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in the reconstruction until a political agreement on an end to the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will soon be convened to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the commission’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the impeachment and scandal does not prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all of history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue of the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled — to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled — to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed cable ratings by gathering 3.5 million viewers at night during the show’s main news.
“This is the fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our grasp,” says Neil Barr, director of the ABC drama Appointed Survivor, about a member of the cabinet who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skovell, a long-published comedian and author of Only Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys' Club, suggests a different theory.
She recalls how she once took a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Yes, because he’s funny!” Mrs. Scowell said.
In all this chaos there is something valuable – it is fun.
Of course, unlike all other content broadcast on television, the storylines of Washington’s events can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, when you’ve been watching for the sixth hour in a row, a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward’s “deep background” for his book Fear, or about Paul Manafort’s jacket for $15,000 of ostrich leather (clothes insulated with pride), as the poster writes “Washington Post”.
I will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.

When I contacted Mr. Flays this week, there was 27 degrees warmth on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t break away from the screen, at least not exactly when they show how Brett Kavanaugh stands before the Senate Judiciary Committee and decides the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” he said.
“I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsider money is pouring into the toughest midterm elections held by the White House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is getting cash flow due to a change in congressional districts in which two officials compete for the same seat.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not so long ago changed, is backed by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who took a seat in another county in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is speaking out against another incumbent official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th County of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that as a result of election machinations, the old districts were attributed to Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated debate over the funding of campaigns between the main party’s financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning with a small difference in the widely observed March special election to Congress in 18th County, Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district, receiving 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. He was also in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to be held in order to summarize a similar meeting that took place last year, which was perceived as a step forward in the efforts to achieve progress.
By mid-September, however, high-ranking officials of the administration had made clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to continue, and to effectively cease consideration of the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it as a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomats have returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on details of the debate reported by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst who is part of the administration, but also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is currently very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also investigating the facts of Trump’s campaign collusion with Russia and its attacks in the past election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the electorate, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many “if”; I do not mean that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do so, and this missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history is unfolding at such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he proposed to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his inadequacy for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times’ data is wrong.
“How will we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still approved for the position of supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later accompanied me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic on the eve of the confrontation with the football club Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers are accepting the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from scoring a 2–2 lead against Villarreal for the first time in the season, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we left with a draw.
Maybe in the end, we could do it, but overall, none was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am confident that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year definitely turned out to be tough, given everything that’s related to my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there’s a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly selected, and the guys really get pleasure from it; the training went on the "hour".
I hope that we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed.”
Women Lose Sleep Because of Fear of Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t try to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, the nationwide vice president of life insurance.
You have to start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for what they’re likely to have to take care of you unless you express your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in terms of costs.
Consult with your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life money insurance policy that will help cover those expenses or insure yourself with your own property provided you have the money.
Put your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battles.
Set up a health care trust and appoint a trustee who will oversee your health care and ensure that specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that you consider the possibility of establishing financial credentials.
You should choose a trustee who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you are incapacitated.
Do not forget about the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
In this case, can you provide information about what medications he is taking and to what he is allergic?
Write down all these details on paper so that you are properly prepared for any occasion.
Martin adds: “It’s not just about having finances, it’s about choosing doctors.”
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write down and write down this plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the outage of communications, rescuers are unable to receive any information from Donggal, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district that extends along 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and in particular, the coastal region of Donggal.
Nickel mining is also important for the province’s economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief, the tsunami has devastated Palu and Donggal several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Volcanic Fire Ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 occurred on one of the islands of Mentawa near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily left in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Palin from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a situation of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility and will be released under bail of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unambiguous innocence.”
Palin is threatened with three class A petty crimes, which means he can be detained for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of domestic violence and possession of alcoholic weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after she explained her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of casualties will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social networks, there are videos of the incident.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutor's Office Wants to Issue Rare Death Penalty to Suspect in New York Terror Attack
The New York Federal Prosecutor’s Office is pursuing the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare federal crime that has not been enforced in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to achieve the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two charges may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read Saipov a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of racketeering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of using violence and destroying a car.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "meticulously planned and deliberate", Saipov carried it out, as described, "in a disgusting, cruel and criminal manner."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlya, Alejandra Ferruccio, Hernandez Ferruccio, Erna
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since the prosecutor in New York’s Southern District demanded the death penalty for a crime.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was glad that he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching a video of ISIS on the phone.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov's side, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that a decision to apply the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only aggravate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had earlier appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Not Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army.”
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the flu" of Eurosceptics, as one member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have “goed out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit’s secretary.
However, the problem that May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is aggravated by the fact that members of the Tory party who oppose leaving the EU are joining a separate protest against Brexit that is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying hard to keep his compromise plan, voiced at the Chekers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihalle that he wanted to “defeat the Chekers.”
He proposed that Mr. Faraj be leveled and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have gone out,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will continue to advocate for Brexit, but we need to defeat the Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving journalists a comment: “I’m saying, Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Checkers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, he is also unpopular among members of our party and our activists who are actually storming the streets and electing us first and foremost.
Please put the Chequers aside and start listening to what they tell you.”
In her harsh address to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at work if they remain true to their promises.”
Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum, they need to be made to “feel the cold.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let this out of your hands.’”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, to feel full.
“We are mobilizing the nation’s people’s army, which gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit opponents held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Tori vs. Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim they can customize Canada plus plus IT systems and technology to work at borders, to free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
A good Brexit does not exist in principle,” he said.
Warren plans to “examine carefully” the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
U.S. parliamentarian Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “examine carefully the possibilities of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dela, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
There are talks that she has a chance to take the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Hollywood, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a city hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was “the time for women to go to Washington to “fix” our broken government, and for that to happen, there needs to be a woman upstairs.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuck), the LSU player was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which took place on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was captured on video.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stepped in for his friend, and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting at Wade Sims.
During the arrest, Simpson did not resist and was detained in the police department of East Button-Roge County.
A young man with a height of 1 m 82 cm grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 picks per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it has become clear that Mercedes team tactics will play a major role in the race.
Already from the pole position Bottas started well and practically hung on Hamilton, when he defended his position in the first two turns, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to weave in the tail of the whole group - a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some fight "wheel-to-wheel", burst forward, which led to the fact that the driver "Ferrari" reluctantly left the interior space on the side of the road free, risking the two-wheeled.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race, holding on to his home tyres in order to quickly finish, pushing Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, as Rykkonen took fourth place.
The day turned out to be difficult because Valtteri did a fantastic job on the weekend and showed real nobility by sharing this with me.
The team has done such exceptional work to have a couple of tricks in stock,” Hamilton said.
Traitorial Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not released a letter from Christina Blaise Ford accusing Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were “ugly, ugly and false people.”
“The only possible reaction to all of this, and what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, is great, it’s anger, anger, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you "swallow" the information?
Do you remember her answer... you “melted” the information of the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't spill.
Okay, stop.
Did we “swallow”?...No, we did not “swallow,” he added with the senator’s intonation.
In July, a letter was sent to Finstein detailing the allegations made by Ford against Cavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally made public, but Finstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t conceal Dr. Ford’s claims, but I didn’t merge her information,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the allegations of leakage appears to displease the president, who commented on this during a Saturday rally: “I’ll tell you what: body language has made her a great mistake.
“Maybe she didn’t shed, but body language was the worst thing I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend his candidate for supreme judge, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power by all means available.
We see uglyness, uglyness, they don’t care who they offend, through whom they have to step in to get power and control,” he said.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning a rematch on Saturday with a 5-3 score in favor of the Dundee.
The Giants got an early lead in two goals thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer took the Giants to the lead.
François Bouchard compared the score of the Dundee before the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen consolidated their victory.
For the men of Adam Keith, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two sides, when the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goal run with support from David Rutherford, after which Bouvier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markward helped Cooney level the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored a second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the score, scoring a goal with a numerical lead of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by keeping the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are headed to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid the earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he deliberately went to death in order for the plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many missing as a result of a strong earthquake on Sulawesi island on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Strong underground thrusts continue to destroy the area, many residents of the city of Palu found themselves under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the terribly rolling control tower of Mutiara Sis al-Jaffrey Airport, the city of Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when it seemed to him that the top was falling down, he jumped from it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter was able to land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths as a result of the earthquake could reach thousands, as, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of casualties is likely to increase as a large number of people are still under debris, and many have never been able to get out of there,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring in victims every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The staff of the Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but everything could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and spoke to the country’s armed forces, saying in particular, “I ask all of you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” says CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Now Reports One Person Missing After Airplane Crashes in Lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person has disappeared, while previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking plane.
The Air Niugini report said that as of Saturday afternoon, it had no information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police in attempts to locate the man.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and the crew of the plane after it fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane is entering the runway too low.
“And that’s very good,” adds Janes.
Janes said he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was along the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses panicked and screamed on board, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors who repaired the nearby dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they were taking people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Flight Safety Network data shows that over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in plane crashes with PNG-registered airlines, but none of these crashes had anything to do with Air Niugini.
Analyst on intelligence managed to prove the fact of the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a lawsuit against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette has given several hours of testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used the tapes from a mobile phone to create a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulett said he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to those data, Tellis spent the evening with Chambers, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his cell phone was near Chambers; when the circumstance was found out, police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to the records of phone calls, they were called only for one week.
Roulett also showed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale says.
The defense should begin its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is “conscious hip-hop”?
The hip-hop trio is going to fight against the negative attitude to this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The band The High Breed of Bristol claims that the content of hip-hop has changed, leaving behind the original political and social problems.
The band members want to get back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues a family couple over racist text
A New York nanny sued a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black” that a woman mistakenly sent to a nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racists, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with a “purpose of extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the babysitting service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEET, NOT ONLY THIS, ONE MORE BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her dismay, the "confused" Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, stating in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, was doing her job poorly, and in general that they were expecting a Filipina, not an African-American, reports the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing a family couple and demanding compensation for $350 a day for six months — under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not enshrined in any contract.
“I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the allegations of racism, and claim that Morris’s dismissal could be considered a reasonable step, as if they offended her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” his husband, Joe Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you’ve been rude to, even if you’ve been rude to yourself without wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on, you!"
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you ready to pursue someone who is in this position?
It’s not very nice of you,” added a banker who specializes in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already issued its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and logic problems.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, said in a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, responded to the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it's published.
It’s fun to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator for the BBC, and would have been optimistic about the refusal to publish, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was "and the author of their joyful and bitter year" because in the past year, he was not the author.
As for Paddington’s own bear, she refers to him as a “very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
After all, Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of them, even though he did not really consider that success to be his own merit.
I think that’s how he treated Paddington’s success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Over regularly called and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually stopped acting, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tightly in my hands.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, accepting the huge loss she had just had to endure.
“No one around knew what had happened,” she says.
“My head went out, I never stopped crying.
This is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-embracing feeling of sympathy for Hope.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who have survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place postcards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he started depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she says.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was as if the light was on in the room.”
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was going through a really terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler's own brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was found dead.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m not stopping being afraid of a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis invented these postcards, “so that people know there is someone you can turn to and tell everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit there and be quiet, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her husband, with whom she has lived for 15 years – he did not become soon after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he got especially bad: he didn’t even look at the kids when they opened their gifts.”
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this, this event shocked our family.
It tore her to pieces.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance: FBI starts investigation
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for — an investigation limited in time and scope — we could bring at least a little unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “breaking up” against the backdrop of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, things go badly for Republicans, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and elect him as the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Cavanaugh, who at the time worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equal votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined, the South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bong Seug, referring to the ministry’s data, said that compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, that figure fell to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates imposed by smugglers exporting people were key factors.
Pyongyang does not comment publicly.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the reliably protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjects them to forced repatriation.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume stalemate nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached a general agreement on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yun Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have the slightest confidence in the United States, we won’t have confidence in our national security either, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House of Representatives, called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave like that, she would immediately be called a ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly occurred when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh performed quite emotionally, sometimes even screaming and suffocating, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally denounced the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and clearly planned killing of an active person” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh had only confirmed in his testimony that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased towards Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with his claims, as well as the way he’s taunting the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only good for the Supreme Court, he’s good for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Health Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would annul some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time to let a hysterical and biased person into the position of the supreme judge and at the same time to shout, ‘How magnificent!’” says Pelosi.
Women should own it.
It's a righteous anger, months and years of anger, she can't go through it without tears.
“When we’re angry, we cry,” Ms. Stein told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that unusual, do you?”
She continued: "I was very much helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a leadership position. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique by which she explained to her interlocutor: "You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
In fact, I’m angry.”
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: I once cried out of fury, but I was grabbed by an old woman, a soulless manager I had always been terribly afraid of, and dragged into a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying for anger.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you in.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some unserious intrigue and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to stop her running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case “The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
The campaign had already come to an end, she was far behind in raising funds, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, offered her only $250.
“What am I to them, a valued commodity, or what?” she wondered.
When she made a speech announcing that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and the anger she felt over gender discrimination.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my monument?
"She cried endlessly?"
How a trade war with America could be beneficial to Beijing
Experts believe the first waves of a trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump made his first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs impacted goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has carried out equivalent retaliatory strikes each time, recently imposing tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, ranging from five to ten percent.
China has promised that retaliation against the United States will be equal every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to begin experiencing even the slightest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to back down means to give in to demands, but to publicly give in to the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic slump in any of these countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security.
The foreign minister said that Syria "ready" for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave due to terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept aid on any terms or aid from countries that sponsor terrorism.
Europe confirms victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 – 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-distance hit in the water in the 16th hole of par-3, giving up his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1-in-4 of the players who ever went 5-0-0, since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a 5:4 defeat by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Turbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, conceded 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have competed in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in the entire history of Europe with 25.5 points per career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Rama, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2-1 score in a single game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud of this win — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite odd for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, surpassing only Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team fought all weekend, vainly trying to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to shake Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward in pursuit of success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news Concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife reflects the overall decline in red tide concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of abundant blooms in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide stretches approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinell to southern Lee County.
Foci can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but compared to last week, their numbers have declined significantly.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there were reports of average concentrations in Pinellas County and nearby, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro County, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota County and in coastal areas, high concentrations in the shoreline, and high concentrations in the shoreline.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a likelihood of respiratory irritation.
In northwest Florida, no such probability was reported last week.
