DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on one coming into conversation with him once, also talking to him about why he apparently felt this or that in the way that is laid out in his statement," Grindel said in the "Phrasenmäher" football podcast of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite months of debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil, who is not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to put pressure on him, but he knows it from football so that when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t happened so far.”
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire brigade of Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the screed settlement, there was a risk of delay.
The professional firefighters went out and found the hut on arrival in full fire.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris had to be removed to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged in a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Resists: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Road
What led Lindsay Lohan to do this very strange thing?
Apparently, she wanted to rip off the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live as she apparently wants to rip off the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial cut of the stream.
Here you can see "Kissed for Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
The video shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to make up as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees the actress, Lohan chases the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of child trafficking.
For all this, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
“The whole world is seeing this right now,” Lohan says in the video as she continues to chase the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earring.
In tears, the actress complains about how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to do this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is supposed to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise even further.
Rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced the electric car manufacturer’s withdrawal.
The U.S. stock market regulator sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party (Congress)
Strictly guarded - the party parliament of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party’s congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doubles for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is going to be called North Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the population will vote on it - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" claims to be an anti-system candidate and is thus in the forefront of the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" development takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said development director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, detained and on leave, Audi chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wants to discuss further on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the head of Audi of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after they became aware of the emissions fraud companies.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot currently heads the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Voice".
Basically, he sees a decline in demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Scotland is committed to electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations available.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for president of the DFB again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make them as good as I can," Grindel said as a guest in the ZDF's "Aktuellen Sportstudio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try to get re-elected again and again, and I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association found it "strange" if he did not "have a desire to cooperate on the future project" after the bid for the 2024 FIFA World Cup.
Grindel has been the association’s chairman since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship organizer Philipp Lahm will work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he will continue to consult with the Bureau in this role in the future and then, of course, is cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," Grindel said.
Speculations on whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background is clearly involved in society and football and says ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Lose weight properly with a semi-smart scale
I have had a new toy for four years.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat.
Muscle and bone mass can also show them.
The body-mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say anything about me replacing fat with muscle?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear start for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his compulsory game debut.
Ex-Meister Brose Bamberg won the compulsory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg beat the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter with 24 points on the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
With the basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new game maker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
Brunschweiger, to whom NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens a mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake up our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially closed.
Thousands of police officers were on duty, including snipers.
The Ditib Islam Association is criticized for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe und Terrorsekunde
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York Central Park.
"Commit yourselves wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I’m nervous, I sweat, but it’s okay, because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage for several hours.
In the meantime, however, there was a frightening second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal latch was a shot, were frightened and tried to flee.
Shortly there was panic, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - buhrufe for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge in the Supreme Court, knocking many women in front of their heads.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted by two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault on their way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also join me at any time in an elevator," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York City.
Press freedom: Federal government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The t-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption to the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He has therefore caused the person's guardians to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is true regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged spying activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused controversy.
They were freed and were able to return to Germany, but trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for damp conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets her guests with some beer, some wine or even higher percentage drinks to ease the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Verdict" or "The Hottest Day".
However, the trip to the high north did not go well for the Municher.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely cracked on it, his eyes only two small slots.
The bed selfie shows a fully-fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Speaking to his fans, he posted some - perhaps not quite serious - findings he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black pig.
And spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws around three and a half, also leaves out.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips on how to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache pills.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the usually attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly saflage.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and filth
The entrance to the 36-kilometre railway cycle path in Redkappenland in Treysa is difficult to find and wasteful.
Recipes against grass-roots vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with a seat group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship object Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland a more than infamous sight.
Members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt and others have been involved in the topic for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city’s bicycle traffic commissioner.
The issue has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the placement of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the bid of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local council.
It’s not just the garbage that drives cyclists and locals around – the sitting group is a regular meeting place on weekends to celebrate.
Not only does it often happen loudly, but the flooring is also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, garbage bins are demolished, signs are crooked, seating furniture is greased.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for saplings.
"Along the entire cycle path here on the Haaße-Hügel is clearly the focus," confirms the bicycle traffic commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new bicycle site in Ziegenhain, which will open today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this puts the threshold much higher to committing to common property.
However, this would assume that a police strip will then pass by in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far, one can be very satisfied.
The tourist market is still expandable.
Our bike path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany,” say the ADFC members.
Susanne Klippert, an ADFC member, assesses the situation in the Asherröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical danger site.
There is no bending trail on the hill of hate.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides,” she explains.
This is not a problem for athletic drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music competition at the cultural station: The "cow of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winks in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Immig, a long-lived Albachtener in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Wewärz Zkamp and Claus.
This contest, the mayor of the district, Joachim Schmidt, explained, was a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers associate with?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the towns.
Rolf Immig named the alley "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints to their creation.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke was able to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Alvin Jasic has posted on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special about the jury’s favourites – so that others could hear their songs as well.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himmig with his Hiltrup Schlager, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed once again for the final – and even without electronic support sounded “really good,” as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, pervasiveness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, chairman of the District Offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very crowded cultural station.
The word-game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords that you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - when you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side can not accidentally read anything.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the concepts that are to be guessed here, but the codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" should be guessed not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: in this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because this is what the game wins if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads out loud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" and "Prague" would also be possible because he has been careful in the school and knows the window fall there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better summed up with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the rewrites should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But those who have just started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this seemingly insignificant game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also supports an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And for those who are just about rates and not about winning points, they can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach at night from Saturday to Sunday twice as much.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, later he also appeared in a pub in the Upper City when he molested other guests.
After not complying with the police's referral, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must also be held criminally liable for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schublocks
The railway station in Pressig has been the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers knocked on buffers, you heard it in a very pressing way," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
Then the brakes stopped and the wagons crawled.
It was pure railway.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel’s homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which, after an elevation of about 220 meters, has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, traction and thrust blocks were previously needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operation workshop with 21 locomotives, an apprentice workshop, a pipeline and a railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader for 47 years.
From the Pressig railway station (BW), which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for traction and buoyancy blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights had been ranked each month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were discontinued, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport, has not been envisaged."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" at a pompous railway festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later that out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rangers and hemming shoemakers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any wrongdoing would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with success at the China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kasatkina when the number 13 Russian gave up.
The swan is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open air area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 specimens of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been there himself since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good prospects.
In the past, both have actively participated in the selection of artists and contributed to the design of flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, a special 70-cent stamp designed by them will be available at every art station.
There you can also buy this year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high level of enthusiasm for the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" from the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, brightened in color, playful with 20 wind turbines, 24 hooves and 24 aluminum tubes provided as sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object fabulously blends and invites to rest.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albrechtites also breathed out their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to agree everywhere that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the neighborhood.
It has now become a legend: on a bench in the tin bush they lifted the MGV 68 alabaster from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated big in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," thought Chairman Jürgen Holsteige, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
To celebrate the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
It was a tradition for years, then there was a break.
In time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was it to festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Meeting" in rows of seats, but cozy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was fashionable: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made the voice sound.
Suitable for the occasion were cheerful songs.
He said, “A day as beautiful as today.”
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops".
Again, the choir was conducted by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holsteige: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singingly.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
With the proceeds, the children of the Albatros Youth Center will be financed a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is very good in League three.
No sign of shyness or frickin' sausages, the independents are doing their thing.
And that's really good at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"It wasn't clear, but we've already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately committed to it: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was hacked.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish line, such a game can already tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
Eventually, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the goal.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our necks.
I’ve seen really good volleyball in phases,” Annacker didn’t have the 0-3 – and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents is going does not seem foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball." In the fourth league, they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not dirty in the next few weeks, they need to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series may have had a co-crime in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left for good.
The series, which made her a star, could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller says in conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called to Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She believes it is possible that her then-husband could have been quite jealous, but "how many men did Hans shy away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed myself," she continues.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the state wedding I was sitting crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had love at the time "as imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I was too naive about love.”
The night owl, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ-Resort Zurich, this time dared to attend the ZFF opening party.
Our wrinkle is not a moth, but it is a bit shy of light.
And the bright glow in which a green carpet is immersed in the six-leaf square blinds him over fee.
But it is still a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he roams over the square to make himself comfortable in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large plumbing company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The needs institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to create a luxurious atmosphere.
On this evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason.
So out here, across the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the beginning of the festival, as every year, with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: from all over the world, the works shown are known to have originated.
What you don’t have to imagine in an article about this festival to not fall into the sleigh advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The wrinkle binds a little bundle around the feeler, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doorkeepers actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the guests crowd, dance to live music long after midnight or let DJs pretend to have rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite meals with Cüpli.
In the delicacy shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for snorkeling mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bursts.
And the hammer is: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleaned out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If this is two separate instructions, he has detached himself in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the top floor, the poultrymen tilt a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily awarded to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the said brand for years, is not here that evening either.
However, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that is familiar to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character may not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He is not attacked, he is not endowed, he is stolen at most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a clampdown, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team’s victory.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have made a good living in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cockpit to cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, excited by the players.
The Mexican second-place finisher defeated the Leones Negros 2–0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Bundesliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute split "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, not played badly for long periods of time, the broadcasters.
Only the initial stage "we have totally slept", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The housekeepers quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletsky had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"Then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter-hour.
At the break, the gap was only two more goals.
In particular, Senden’s best, Marius Hintze, met at a different time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst scored at 15:15, then the season changer ran almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the apparently still calming three hits (29:26).
What then?
Let the unbiased intervene.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff dismissed was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, backwards also stood well against seven men and repeatedly thrown to the empty gate.
Only you can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the unscathed Bieletsky.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old woman from Naila (county court), police search for the woman's remains.
Operational forces excavated a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers of it were removed, as the police and the prosecutor's office jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing may not have been buried far from their home at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
At the time, investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Public Prosecutor’s Office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators, using a ground radar, encountered a conspicuous sight beneath the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials confined the spot to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisory Authority (SEC) filed an extrajudicial lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk resigns as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board chief.
The CEO may remain against it.
In the comparison, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also runs space company SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of his guilt.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the funding was secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Later, Musk rushed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the deal, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk’s communications.

Shortly before the end, Sturridge rescued the Reds with a sledgehammer in the corner.
Record-breaking champion Manchester United is slipping deeper into the crisis after its worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United earned 1:3 (0:2) and with ten points after seven days of play remains only in the tables midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League start after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.

"Let's Dance" Juror Joachim Llambi and Mrs. Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Image on Sunday" (Bezhalinhalt) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert.
"Our clients have mutually agreed and amicably separated," lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told BamS.
The most important thing for both of them is the well-being of their two daughters.
The couple reportedly met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television for his jury work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as for various appearances in quizzes and entertainment broadcasts.

Polls: 46% don’t want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
Following the quarrels of the past few weeks, GroKo receives several low-pitched surveys.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD overcame the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one count to 17 percent, the SPD drops a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value to date for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag were to be held on Sunday, the SPD, CDU and CSU, according to Emnid, would receive only 43 percent of the vote.
As a result, the great coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a combined 53.4%.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second-largest party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach vote shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, and the FDP is at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the proportion of votes.
But even support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has declined significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid poll on behalf of the BamS found.
Only one in two (50 percent) would like the big coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, according to the current poll, and 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed significant declines in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also weighing whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against, according to Emnid.
Accordingly, 64 per cent of EU supporters want a candidacy, 35 per cent do not.
Aldi's Hangout: Price Reduced for Love Happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place for acquaintances radiates almost an anachronistic romance for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargaining at the swing table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for later grandchildren in doubt than just a swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don’t talk about hot stuff for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
There is real Hollywood love story potential when love is preceded by an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-found-plot.
If the guy still contacts his loved one at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this announcement in an unknown Aldi branch to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has talked a little over the "30 percent reduced organic beef".
For her belief in the magic of analog dating, she definitely deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger School has been participating in the campaign "Cover against polio - 500 lids for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, referred to in German as infantile paralysis, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be curbed by vaccinations, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand calm for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's fitness and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us good," said the idol-friend Reus after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No haste to negotiate with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see a rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

"There will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky TV on Sunday evening.
Soccer: District League: VfL Wolbeck vs SC Altenrheine
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard ones.
He gave himself up, the coach of the football district leaguer VfL Wolbeck, retired first (inwardly) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Baptismal proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only slim pass at the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked for each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscle problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly to a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It would almost have been revenge when the SCA hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer in the 41st minute - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his skill.
After the break, the VfL boldly took full control.
Thieves from 18 meters hardly failed.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entrance.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, fetsch on the left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrhein’s Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the pitchers 18 meters in front of the guesthouse.
The coward acted himself and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slap hit lower left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty more minutes, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck mishandled the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to secure their first home win.
Attacker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting elf for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a shy injury and was supposed to prevent the SGE from scoring further goals according to standards with his head-ball strength.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
During the landing of a helicopter, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, pulled to the ground and came to rest laterally.
Police, rescue and firefighters were immediately contacted.
With a large order, the troops arrived at the site of the accident.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to return home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigations.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the boards of directors were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and submitted in advance to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to act differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses in the companies of the Index of Medium Values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies – pioneers in recent years – the proportion of women has stagnated.
There were 26 women on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to commit to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges with the Supervisory Boards: as of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If you recruited as many women each year for the board of directors, it would reach 40 percent by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make a mess: luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.

Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers pay per car they sell?
Autopapst and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made an operating profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of effort on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38.000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

In the already packed party tent, the president of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of such a thing - this is a madness for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Later, wine princess Lisa II symbolically kicked off with the guests from the stage.
"It's good that so many have found their way to us again after Abtswind". Later "Die Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had fixed drink prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest’s house, before going into the second round a day later in the festive tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in Taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When you call an ambulance, they are supposed to help - best to save lives.
Such a rescue took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old woman.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an ambulance with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the paramedic and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance had crossed a red traffic light with blue lights and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided at a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Grün.
After the collision, the medical car crashed against a traffic light and a tree.
He caught the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from service.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old nurse was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another ambulance called here tried this - but without success.
The three injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the prosecutor’s office in Bonn, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
Manchester United have lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United will face ManU 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to still speak.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the revived Marko Arnautovic shot it 3:1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all the defenders of Manchester stood still, and all the time Arnautovic left the world to pass the ball on helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously inadequate performance over long distances.
At the moment, the situation is quite different for United's rival Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho’s big rival Pep Guardiola came to a 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defense bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer a leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league cup, Xherdan Shaqiri defeated Chelsea 1-1 with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Eden Hazard, a Belgian, was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, almost missed the draw after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge scored better in the 89th minute with his sledgehammer.
After the Reds started the week with an impeccable balance sheet, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated a 2–0 win.
However, the Gunners fans, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a message of success against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckyly pushed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third-season goal.
Arsenal moved past Watford for the fifth consecutive victory and is now in fifth place immediately behind the big rival Tottenham. A strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated in the league for the fifth time in a row in a 2-0 draw against Southampton.
VW’s core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic but ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the ringing for driving bans and retrofits should not be let go by the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital, they will showcase their novelties from next week.
The diesel does not really play a big role anymore.
The possible replacement and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the shining backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is expected to be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have already been officially announced.
BMW’s iNext is scheduled to start in 2021.
The center of attention in Paris is the new 3.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the aftermath of the tsunami.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and transport connections are damaged, huge property damage has occurred.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
The numbers so far are only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities - along the west coast of Sulawesi - are also affected.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Divine Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a relief team.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to perform anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m. onwards, the bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker’s early starters were on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or already with a rich curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the Biker-God service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues skirt, Valerie Lill rather suggests poetic-quiet tones," says Pastor Frank Schröder.
Yesterday was also certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: after the apple comes the milk
And also during the actual day of action Borish was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely shredded mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple piece, which looked a bit like crochet, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was not so difficult at all.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually poured into a large vessel.
But the fruit-growing farmer also had ready-made specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in fruit peat" was correspondingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up jumping castle for themselves.
Activists of the Fuchtorr comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited at some stations for short-lived games.
The home association will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the spargel village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: after all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth-season tie: "Fucking situation"
After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and spoke to them courageously.
However, a lot of positives were not seen before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
“It’s a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team,” said 96-year-old football pro Pirmin Schwegler, pushing forward: “This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action.”
The still unbeaten Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, are with two counters at the bottom and are a descent candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, on the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Roma, scored seven points in the middle of the field.
Croatian vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hesse during his debut and never got in control of Hanover’s defense.
The striker, who had been battling for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and enforceability why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian loaned by FC Liverpool was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which started swinging.
Lucas Torró's 17th header, which was thrown into the net, was in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96th defense around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced short-term loser Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the house owners fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defending corner into the penalty area, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defense player who came in the summer from French second-leaguer AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt lay still before the break.
This time Haller fit his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully refueled and left 96-goal goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the interim, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak representation of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces into Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons were now playing a little more boldly forward, but burning ideas remained out until just before the end, when at least the follow-up hit.
The Hessians were much more efficient there.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a run for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite cooler temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it in front of millions of audiences at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or the following Sunday.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who originated in the Thirty Years’ War and is believed to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing, the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting the secular part of the feast to the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been established, which was only made possible by the sighting by means of scaffolding.
The plastering of the pedestal is completed, natural stone works are still to be started before winter, and we hope to be able to complete well half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
In Münsterblickstraße, the Danube-Iller Lebenshilfe opens a new home for people with disabilities.
That in the Münsterblickstraße is now handed over "a very special house" of his destiny - at the inauguration date all those present agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair riders who have already been living in the residence of the Danube-Iller life aid for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger spaces and accessible access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a cell phone hood: "The house had come into the years and was no longer modern in the equipment," Bader said, looking back.
In 2016, the excavators attacked to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Danube-Iller opens a new residence
Around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million was invested in the new construction.
The free state contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
Jürgen Heinz, the managing director of life support, also thanked him for this.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, also commented: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile".
Housing and functionality had been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The plot in this situation is a real case of luck, because in today's situation it can no longer be acquired."
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud to be the life support manager of the eleven full-time staff, all of whom are employed on a fixed-rate basis.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Before the day of unity, SPD deputy chairman Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this dirty dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon’s office reported on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get used to it.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and apply jointly for the holding of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the reciprocal approach, Kim also agreed to shut down the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's Moving History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to substantive work - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition’s working week starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not lastly invoke the "return to work" mantraly.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask the right question, what is the difference between work and hard work, but that is it.
If the federal government is now so far behind as to re-dedicate itself to its task – to governing – then it should not be prevented from doing so with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blunders of the last few weeks will probably be shown already on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties come together to the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflict early; a lesson from all the controversy.
First, however, with the diesel upgrades and the immigration of skilled workers, conflicting issues are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesel.
While an approximation has taken place over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay-at-home perspective for rejected asylum-seekers who are working or doing training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not Equal and Equal has teamed up with GroKo, but three partners with some very different social profiles and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests does not advance.
To be constructive, however, disputes cannot be re-established for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always keep in mind the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this guide question, both the diesel and the track change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the People’s Party has to fight for it.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour specifically violate the applicable labour law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their lawyers had been working on social security reform, an overwhelming social affairs minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of List Mushroom Mandate Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes as a surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament via inquiry.
She assumes that "the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and did not in any way want to announce violations of applicable service law in front of current cameras".
However, she now has questions to be able to "speak free of any suspicion".
Police search for a woman's body on a road
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, excavations have been carried out on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgreen area until Monday.
It was previously assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its guide in repeated use, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road.
For more than a year, the Prosecutor’s Office and the Criminal Police Court have been handling the missing persons case.
Again and again, a bicycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike’s body could have been blocked here 30 years ago during the construction of the new state road.
Color powder and eggs: cravats in Barcelona before the anniversary of Catalonia
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is celebrated for the first time.
But there are cramps beforehand.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police took place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the pro-independence activists with color powder, among other things, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers of the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in the polling stations for the illegal referendum last year.
At the time, there was violence in trying to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing the officials with colored bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, authorities said in a statement.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in the fall of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in U-detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled Councillessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split up
Red-White Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third one were revealed to 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as assembled awkwardness.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Anyone who wanted to buy a beer or a fried sausage could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torch chance, because there were practically none.
First shot in half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the whole game, Güterslohs scored Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - opportunity the Ahleners had when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Attacker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the ever-increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour, the freight holes also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The fast-moving opponent over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62rd) with a lazy shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they lost with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from former athlete Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, initially bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
Thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but he didn’t get anything either.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlens Interim Trainer.
Offensively "smashed everything so little" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
I didn’t feel like we could get a back goal,” Daut said.
Unfortunately, as a spectator, you didn’t feel like your team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was brightly blue, while the space was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "It's so nice here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, who were actually to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short-term.
Verena (Daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) is ill.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not take time to entertain the increasing number of visitors musically.
This happened so well that at a later hour some folk songs were sung.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is delighted with the many actives with their stands, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board," he thanked the men's choir for the action.
Andreas Hajek praised the work of all those who were in the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - here something goes.
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
At many stands was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his decoupage saw.
Veneering, beer lids with reckenfelder motifs and much more he had on offer.
A specialty was offered by three Reckenfelder beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, strangers have advertised for the construction of a skating rink in a hardly conducive way.
At several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" appear on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the sign at the staircase of the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at the time apparently had been "only" left with an edding, it could be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department School, Sport and Culture, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the dirty board.
For years, local politics and administration have been concerned with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been demolished at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the fire station.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against construction at this point.
At the end of June, there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The city council has the last word.
It will start with a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Engpass in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes," said the head of the union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known human resources shortage in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots will take four to five years," the union leader said.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been wiped out.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe for the surveillance of the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday representatives of the Federation, the countries, the air traffic control, the airlines and the airports come together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, it will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members with the German air traffic control agency.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost estimates and personnel savings for national air traffic controllers are now fully applicable to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not restrict air traffic control further".
Currently, EU regulations would be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs at the airlines will trigger a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Renewal
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chairman Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board of directors at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side has only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are facing this.
The final decision, however, is expected to be made at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent stake in the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests at a distance with a large order.
However, according to the interventionists, advocates of independence repeatedly tried to break the security lockdown.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and shots.
According to reports, there were also ranges between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there have been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to honor the colleagues who opposed the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia almost exactly a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez to AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they strangled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic police officer, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who only did their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is here to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "didn't come to provoke," the policeman said.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and MPs of the conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown was announced a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police reported a serious traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the local exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The task force is on site.

Football: Juve coach praises for top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game together with the half-hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3-1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was also the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three goal scorers, Juve turned the game after the early lag by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanging the worst chaser for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid first placed former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who secured the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And after a corner by the head, Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the striker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record scorer.
“We have to become even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the dominance of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
Former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti’s second-place finish was not hopeless against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top match was decided.
The Portuguese had to get in too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the pitch.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin coach.
Emre can also be seen here.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool has been in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flew off the pitch in the 2:0 victory of the Turins and is locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West has changed his name.
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention at the weekend on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water suit caused head wrinkles and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye", the musician said.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince when he dropped his artist's name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Soccer: A1 Münster: Finally!
Finished!
Hoetmars coach Averhage did not hide his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more handy, we almost never put him in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's shooting possibilities is thin.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar undergoes SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after a great preliminary work of Krause he distributed free standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne initially failed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmaker and in the rematch Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all conceded.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide kicked the ball over the line was the game decided (81st).
"We had criticized each other harshly before, but that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red Card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Circular League A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think of it,” he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he allegedly meant the wingspans with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-white people who appeared with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, waving awkwardly and pulling from then on his players, however, was the relief to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Notably, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we hold against one of the top teams in the league over the whole game, that was really phenomenal."
It seems even more bitter to have to go home empty-handed.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th hit of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
Fabian Fröhning (39th) scored the 2–0 over the left side.
We knew that, but you can’t take out a player like that completely.
"It was madness what he did," Lewandowski admitted recklessly to the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf made the match: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45th).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who scored the equalization (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a tricky, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite oversized numbers, Albersloh was unable to face the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepdogs, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Morning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the national duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Full Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigns
According to media reports, the entire presidency of the second-league football team Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets invoked a joint letter from the Saxon panel in the evening.
Initially, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles of the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure to Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing will hold about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
The director of the academy, Udo Hahn, proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." The fact that celebrities are always appearing at the academy in the castle of Tutzing was also a theme in the presentation of the year's program.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: he wants to personally receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not safe!" reads the title of the meeting.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "riskful and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without limits".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death – war ridicules every human idea".
From structural racism in society, to the scissors between the rich and the poor, to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Hahn, director of the Academy, said: “A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions.”
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits one more visitor of the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other rather a tendency "from the outside to the center".
What does neutrality look like?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Land Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haarendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret performer, Teubner knobs the gender understanding, not only with humor and heartwarming for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there is, but also with music.
The mini-guitar used her and mastered her violin as well.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrup.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied by Süverkrup Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction comes from the man, although he has a partner, but it does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have arisen from Mozart’s composition if “the Nannerl” had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrup passes in improvisations, from Bach's "O Kopf voller Blut und Wunden" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G-Moll Symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, gave flowers to the Chansonette.
However, the chairman of Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, police have slightly corrected the number of victims downwards.
10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
Everyone has now been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be fired during the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was forced unbraked frontally against a dashboard.
Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored only ten goals.
"Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player has scored too many goals.
We didn’t get them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the finals made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a lag, lagging behind at the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (45).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement backroom on the left, who then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: BSV Ostbevern's top performance at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd West League.
In the second-league starter VC Allbau Essen, the Blau-Weißen won 3-1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
That’s what we’ve come up with now,” coach Dominik Münch was delighted after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the top of the table.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice champion of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the two bar, but has not come into play.
We've done her a good job.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the assumption to three bars.
We couldn’t keep up the pressure.
Food has sucked in, and we have let ourselves in a bit,” Münch continues.
At 18:17 for the first time the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses in front.
Although East Bevern defended four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was a better class now," the exercise manager found at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the leaf in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue-White crossed four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Municipality: Mosque Opening as a Missing Opportunity
The Turkish Municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the Great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a heap of shards that can only be hardly reunited," said Gökay Sofuoglu, chairman of the TGD, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the opportunity for a common, reconciling appearance.
“Instead of emphasizing the Muslims’ affiliation to Germany alongside German top politicians, Erdogan used the term for his purposes,” Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "reaffirmed many reservations".
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, it is finally time for a folk reunion.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7:30 pm, the Nottuln Home Association is already organizing its fifth Nottuln Folk Meeting in the chimney room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day, it’s been a year since we held a public meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimverein.
I had no idea that our folk meeting would happen so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the chimney room of the office was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his first "birthday" with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folkreff remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of Folkreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night", delighted the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We are counting on many happy guests to once again spend a sociable and humorous evening," the club's invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The public meeting starts at 7:30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
The billion-dollar merger is still subject to approvals in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the United States.
Recently, the chances of an insider’s approval had improved there because Linde had promised to sell additional company shares.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24, in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, it was a different name at the time: as "Bezirksfrustbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land", it was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-building, no one thought about flowers and gardening at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district homeowner Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should line long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still a task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which includes almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Maulwürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the county council decides," Landrat Söllner added, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The Circle Association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about it, county manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was enclosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, the incentive for the horticultural associations is not to give up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the sharp decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful event, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canada's Foreign Minister postpones UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are putting an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech before the United Nations.
Due to time constraints in calling for a reissue of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, her spokesman, Adam Austen, said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wants to join the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed on a recast of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement in August.
U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a conclusion, the Trump administration wants to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s President-designate Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily O Globo.
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on the open road during an election campaign event in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "Der nicht"), mainly women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Even on social networks, the associations made statements against Bolsonaro that were racist and disrespectful to women.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the million-dollar city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far lagged far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in political operations, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reaches the absolute majority, there will be a ballot on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for fighting against homosexuals and blacks and praising the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked by verbal outbursts.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula’s left workers party should be shot.
Europe wins Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale at the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn’s team of outsiders dethroned the favourite U.S. title defender for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music majors such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the breakup of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Middt om natten" from 1983 is the best-selling album in Denmark to this day.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert night with the power of a tiger". Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum.
After the soundcheck and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no sign of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and its surroundings - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly delight the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening even with the latest, unknown pieces from his own feather and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced during the performance for a harmonious and pressing interaction.
Although "addition" calls are not overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the eager, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuser has, however, gained a special degree of fame since its foundation in 2005.
With full agility, the band presents their hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in conjunction with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo, while he runs through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is part of the genre for one such hard rock concert: for the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixboard team, the three-concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is at about 98 decibels.
This is about the level of the compressed air hammer, but it is still clearly below the controls of the "Wake-Fesitval", to which "The Ignition" point out on their website.
Ear stunners 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual with the annual metal set-piece in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long been convinced with their sovereign, virtuous play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bone saw and lit a concert night with the power of a tiger," all three groups, in the sense of the word, can say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a plane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A sailplane crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
There was a fatal accident near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
According to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailplane crashed at the airport's trade fair parking lot.
The pilot was killed in this.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was alone on board - the pilot is said to be a one-seater.
The plane was already in landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located only a short distance from a festival tent on the airport grounds.
However, an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two cities of the Ruhr area and directly at the driveway to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer for large events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump to Kim: ‘And then we fell in love’
The fact that North Korean President Kim is perfectly sane despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump on Saturday made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprawl of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it turns out to be rather tough pieces in the ring for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was hard, he was hard too, and it went back and forth between us,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay.
No, really.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump pointed to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lip confessions behind it so far.
That the affection for the notorious “Rocket Man” – Trump’s nickname for Kim – may not be remembered by everyone, the US president seemed to be quite aware.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of it when he performed in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: “Donald Trump says they fell in love.”
How awful, how awful is that?
This is so unprecedented.
Trump then pointed his finger at the crowd, “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler best visited, atmospheric as well as above all spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair has cleaned up Baesweiler's downtown on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the fire-fighting tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya using a mobile phone video, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the footage in their cell in the coastal city of Sawia in July under threat of death and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who shot the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
According to the video, he was in danger of death.
One of his fellow fighters was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homeland this year, the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo, said.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not unusual given the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He hasn’t heard of a phone call yet.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local folk school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50, the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the attic of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the courtyard.
The teacher informed the police, which opened the investigations.
Whether things or money were stolen is not yet known.
Description of the offender: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he stuck the car off all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he did not return from a ride in his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search, the man's stay for days remained unclear.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to deepen, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey, according to his own sources.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had been briefly moved to a Federal Ministry of Defense’s flight readiness building at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at the castle Madness - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talks, Erdogan continued to travel to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their interlocutor - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the U.S.: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to respond.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions at the UN General Debate.
“The latest stalemate comes because the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly to the formation of trust,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," he said.
The fact that sanctions could “force North Korea to its knees” is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
To build trust, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there have been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council last year alone imposed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged strict compliance with sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to Pyongyang to discuss the end of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the open-door HoT got nothing of it: white blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power outage had shut down the huge, two-piece refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how they all got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were delighted.
"Cooks can't do better either," one visitor was impressed as Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and teenagers have put on their feet," said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen used card tricks and other pieces of art to amaze them.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Board of Directors of NRW
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Board, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen board had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He resigned as deputy head of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told World on Sunday.
Too many people have fallen in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can understand his move - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the Essen board does that."
Sartor, however, is still active for the Essen board - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor once again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
It is not allowed to follow the approach of “without us, the people of the city will starve”.
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a congress of the boards on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that criticized me that way back then.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after lag - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly hit 0-1, but after 90 minutes, the SGB won 2:1. At the top of the table, in the meantime, the SGB was able to score a 3:0.
Gladbach plays double lead - Schalke without emblem with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an external victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke wins against Mainz for the first time (1-0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvered away in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again put that strength on the day with which it had occupied the first place behind Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparations by Yevgeni Konopljanka, after which the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund once again greets from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half came to the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalled with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublette in the final phase (86th/94) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won the first round.
In the meantime, Werder Bremen, decimated by a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break, had to be afraid of the Stuttgarters.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious scoring gate that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed, debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave the lead twice, ultimately playing 2:2 and still awaiting an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga player.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20-metre shot from the Aargauer, as well as in the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalie in the foal storm.
Against Wolfsburg, the record-breaking French buyout came from OGC Nice for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finished 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgarter counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first match of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to his team: the 23-year-old Serbian retired after a jersey match against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back into the game by a curious goalkeeper (68th), a quarter-hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters acting in excess of numbers back on the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already started the home team with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million people are voting on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three-decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Because of its eponymous northern province, Athens had insisted on a name change and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
Voters will therefore also decide on the future of Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member with a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, injuring them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had raided the refugee street in Alsergrund on Friday at around 10 p.m.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who started on passers-by with his fists tied and trying to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat the officers and stepped on them.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the floor at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He also stepped on the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, concussions and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary faction and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up a fury on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stolped" on the issue.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said, referring to Günter Shabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens' Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
For about 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the Citizens' Association, Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately now it is only a shape cut.
In the spring, the hedge has already been shaved.
The breakfast that always follows at work has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Kanuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well-prepared, had enough rides here at the facility and today it fits everything," said the third Olympia of London 2012.
In the finish, he threw his paddle away from joy and raised both arms victoriously upwards - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the remaining six starters were unable to top his 89.69-second fable time.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary in a single-family house this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - thieves want to use it again.
So the Gauting police inspection yesterday announced the first attempted burglary this fall.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew the residents were not home.
But the alarm system surprised them so much that they fled without any prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha’s bankruptcy: Reality catches up: Bayern vs Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want to be liked by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance cell under the new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to rise to the larger autumn lows for the Munichers.
“A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have gotten a little bit of reality,” said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those who know us know that this is really annoying and that is why we are giving gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year without a goal outside, as at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without a win, losing the lead in the football league for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is not as dramatic as Carlo Ancelotti’s final stage at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches on the outside have delivered two blues in three days, as the last seemingly overwhelming Bavaria are cracking.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he dealt with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the once again inadequate handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first phase of his term positive before the national break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
Thus, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second appearance of the king class this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, begins the short preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax, which had also won AEK Athens sovereign with 3:0 at the start.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the loss of the Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The lawyer acted as a reminder.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind it," the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria was even five meters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with one point of lead.
And so Kimmich, with a wink, at least positively appreciated that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Cause: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the supremacy of interpretation in the permanent dispute-theme Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the line of association.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced the consequences of the attack at the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future, because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-teams, we have to draw very accurate conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England," Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral.
Honestly, as your president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil after the World Cup affair, which started with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he wants to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, that's what I always said.
But he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will now be appointed in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migration background is clearly involved in society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for the office again next year as DFB President.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make them as good as possible," Grindel said.
Man Builds Three Accidents Within Three Hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
He told the driver that he was driving against his car.
However, there was no exchange of staff, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had escaped from the road and was driving against a guide post.
Addressed to this, the man did not want police on the spot and subsequently drove away.
After that, the Red Tale went home.
However, the pensioner has proceeded to his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and stopped a construction vehicle while turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a messy impression and couldn’t remember much anymore.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Nearly 1000 operational personnel still in service.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorfire on a federal military site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, according to one speaker, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of troops is planned, it is said.
In the night to Sunday an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was declared a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighboring forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was said that an outbreak of the fire on neighboring communities is no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1,500 firefighters on the ground tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Federal Armed Forces test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point that will receive reports of damage.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday homeowners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary faction and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up a fury on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stolped" on the issue.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said, referring to Günter Shabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adoption.
Referendum on new state names in Macedonia begins
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their country should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its eponymous northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of pressure, for almost three decades, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the impetus for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the Shoah from oblivion

The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registry is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your requests can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs can continue to be taken only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives are unaware of the deceased’s wishes.
"They then have to make a deputy decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," Immer said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations for storing information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völkers-Albert, says.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, at first everyone would be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family members object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in head counting.
He made it to Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 competitors.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup entrant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the eldest a 74-year-old retired from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants came against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was already two years ago as a 14-year-old at the time in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or wonder child, organizers can begin little.
"Coupling can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even staged computer competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square root of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates receive surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, the chief arbitrator said.
Otherwise, Asians are often at the advantage, because they learn head counting more intensively and with other effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's about Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis ass Serena Williams shows herself from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.

Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency operation was launched to save the baby’s life.
During a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena's lungs were detected.

The government wants to ban more extremist symbols.
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "Symbol Law" for consideration.
This will significantly expand the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle is shaking her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at a strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start annual knitting care on Monday
Farmers in Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start their annual knick-knack care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the poor forested state for about 200 years.
The up to five-metre-wide tree and shrub hedges are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect living spaces scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Federation of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the orders of King Christian VI of Denmark in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their timber houses.
From that time comes his name "Knick": By "knicking" the branches were able to develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, some 45,000 kilometers of hedges stretch between the North and Baltic Seas, giving the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement habitat by some 7000 animal species.
Up to 1,800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed within a kilometre of knick.
However, the knick can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in the winter.
Otherwise, it becomes a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knitting care can only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the local situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because after a flight I still had to drive more than 20 hours since the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that relief goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to the surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly free to run around and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information provision on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before this did not work and we received information only via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they do not know whether they live and where they stay because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on the way to work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information on this?
We don’t know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought “Okay, no tsunami” – and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo pulled himself 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday with a muscle fiber tear in the rear left thigh, the football leaguer said on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the next country break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastián Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals every year.
Despite all this, we can sum up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that was able to attract a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to catch an injured duck.
The action, however, lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Walkers on Lake Olching spotted a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the task force again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the firefighters were able to circle the animal around and push it back to shore, where it was then pushed into a transport crate by a firefighter with a hearty handle after almost an hour.
The duck injured on the chest was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Obersleßheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard wins the World Cup Medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in fourth place at Olympia for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to recover the missing precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to grasp.
Seven tenths of a second were missing out on the bronze.
"I have deliberately taken the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a great event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point, you also have to hit.
The WM-Loipe in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to my heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the singles race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the Kontiolahti (FIN) mass start competition last World Cup winter.
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbo pace
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in a turbo-pace, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh on coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest twist in the drama about Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and First Prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer made angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the former Conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described the heavy precautions on Thursday as "bashing", initially refrained from further attacks on women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared, he said.
Later, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely curtailed the powers of investigators.
One government official told the Wall Street Journal: “They’re not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
According to the municipality, the city of Ried’s mobile radar device, installed in a “civil vehicle” to monitor the speed limit, will be stationed on the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
Against Mainz, however, the time factor also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in there.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed out.
After all, the Königsblauen had managed to bring the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under control.
In fact, it could have been different.
After being led by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given Tedesco certainty: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and pressing".
Don't actually create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "if the team were only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "In fact, I am the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start in the early stages and make a firework from it,” Schalke’s head coach said.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, calm and courageous, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather than worrying about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59th/72nd or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it wouldn’t have been a trembling victory,” Tedesco said, “You’ve already felt the fear a little bit.”
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn’t the only stalker.
Fischbachau: smoke pillar in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 13:30.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and firefighters soon found out the cause: An unknown man had lighted garbage on a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it looked like he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glut unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were engaged in pulling and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating the cause of the fire.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years, I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Politics" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With a lot of gestures, fixed numbers and one joke or another, he brings one of the most conflicting topics closer to the listener: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
At one table the German society sits, at the cat table the first generation of migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not the political right or the left that is decisive, but rather: “Am I for or against an open society?”, he stresses.
Behave rather at first, then the round of discussion starts more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani presents, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The professor of sociology does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the subsequent signing class, he still had an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an outside victory.
In a hard-fought game, Gießen made it into his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had a lot more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the lands in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the newly built area of Landsham-South on the free market.
This is reported by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favorable terms and prices - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are being reviewed" in terms of the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the goal is to have created the applicant ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the assignment can be made.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and double houses and four plots for multi-family houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, with an expectation of eight housing units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot of land as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality will be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free state-funded, income-oriented apartments.
Capacity for 200 people
It is estimated that the area of the newly built area of Landsham-South will provide housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a children’s day care center is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
How Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "great sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting elf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues was not sitting in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two-meter-high Brazilian had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all call Naldo for simplicity, switched in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his deputy captain, who, despite his re-reservist presence, did not hold any grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best scalper, knows that he did not actually get on the lay-off with his coach - but for good reason he gets a break.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn’t easy to tell him that.
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you quite honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he was not in the starting elf.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco explained.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can sneak through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also caught Naldo last.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself also on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points at a 37-month low.
Across Europe, Austria still has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-counter mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland’s industry broke this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened downhill ride could mean the worst has passed," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
However, industry remains the number one growth slowdown in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have not fallen as sharply as since November 2011.
For the seventh month in a row, the companies closed their jobs.
In China too, industrial production fell sharply in August, more than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the trends in sales, employment, stocks and prices are recorded.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds in winning the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in the French football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defender won the title thanks to two goals from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Recently, Olympique Lyon in France, 82 years ago, had made such a good start to the game.
Brazil's Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and finished in the playoffs.
In the meantime, Christopher Nkunku (46) scored 2:0.
With this, Paris also managed the general rehearsal for the pioneering second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the King's class, Tuchel's team had to take the only compulsory game defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
