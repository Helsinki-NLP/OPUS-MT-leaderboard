The Prague Stock Exchange at market close had a negative collapse.
After the morning collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange recovered its losses.
CEZ stock transactions have reached nearly half of current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the previous day's collapse that was nearly 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
So, too, we have a reaction from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the local financial sector.
Securities collapse in Asia
On Tuesday, Asian stocks experienced a dramatic downturn, although the indices, however, over the course of the day subsequently wiped out part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng Index over the course of the day wiped out nearly 4%, but later also some of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while in Shanghai markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than 5%, but in the end the losses stood at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and it will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s foreign exchange office.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer from the consequences.
Slaughter of U.S. Stocks
The U.S. parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (nearly twelve trillion Czech crowns) were to be allocated.
The legislators thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday witnessed a tragic crash, and major stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than a decade.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly 7% and a similar sized collapse was last seen in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the U.S. government can lend $700 billion to banks.
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on a broader form of understanding of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (nearly twelve trillion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to some sources, one could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening financial markets.
Subsequently, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to reach the help of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
“We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislature’s delegates met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give final shape to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.”
“It’s necessary to continue the rehabilitation plan, but I think we’re on track,” Paulson said.
The Signal to Asian Commerce
The global financial crisis is falling sharply on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, who are, in order of time, the first to influence Monday’s market following the Congressional decision.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will pass the law and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some issue.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the rest of the sum if it feels like the program is not performing its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained,that is, to get the finances to buy passive mortgage securities, whose price has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We have elaborated everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday's law and the Senate on Monday," the Republican senator said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate banking committee Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the reduction budget, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard and we've taken a big step forward towards the deal that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan is to help homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage instalments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly instalments expenses for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not so crucial, according to Marek.
"Most importantly, this week, congressional representatives will find an agreement on the support of this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time,” Marek said.
Last Blood Duel: MP3 Players vs Cell Phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should find a self-employed reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to our latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LPs and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it can be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8 thousand crowns, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd perhaps hardly digests the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the life of the batteries that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, which is something that mobile phones don’t even do by mistake.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can read music and video, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even can navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle that no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the screen will require a charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
When it comes to cheap mobile phones, don’t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
An additional problem arises when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do without an adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with some exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create their own media library, sorted by the name of the performers, album name, genre or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, focus on battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs, and clearly ease of use.
If you need music above all as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is possible now, clearly on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular, the vast majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something frowns in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always wear the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
The advantage of readers is, among others, easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our selection) and anyone who handles them can do it.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling at one time with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start-up of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for the transmission of data.
What device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, they fall within the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do it even with the 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
In this regard, Sony Ericsson has made more progress, which walkman line phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands ensure the same service and the same price category up to 4,000 kronor, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, in general up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Possibly.
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
There’s something missing here anyway – a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
We have already written many times about the fact that Czech traders belong to the most expensive ones in Europe on Mobil.cz.
After all, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed it, which noted that the price of SMS is higher by us than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regularisation of roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradox will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that would really like to start the clash.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage far above 100%.
In contrast, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák often emphasizes, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer has many possibilities. (Otherwise, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It was the entry into the market of virtual operators that led to a significant price drop, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, sounds similar to ours resonated in Britain.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can be truly successful.
After all, for examples we do not have to go very far.
In February of this year we have informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs among others U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In other words, to be able to work effectively, he needs much less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offering low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the narrower service offering.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even to bet on a target group.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and can be trusted," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if we can also assert a concept similar to that of Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say the operators of the mobile network
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic, Mobilking will not.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not have much expectations.
Mobilking will instead be turned on in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobile.cz.
Thus it has indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything because you do not create any potential competitor.
For some time now he has not hidden his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner it gets better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Informal information suggests that the first virtual operator should be available by the end of the year.
For now, however, an impenetrable wall of silence is erected around his creation.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, from Telef<0xC3><0xB2>nika O2, said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
The other operators also have recourse to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: “We have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both of us, on which it is possible to continue to build.”
“In the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent Authorities -with Complicit Operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around the creation of U:fon testify that when operators hold onto one thing they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure against <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by public access information from the web pages of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But now U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile telephony market has been strengthened only recently with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and especially on his services.”
Of the attitude of mobile operators, however, the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulators is quite surprising.
It is not only the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, in relation to all the problems has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure lease contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead, the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, is more than a delicate deal.
Particularly when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile services."
But obviously pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and lowering prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the same price of gasoline for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so he has no corresponding greater responsibility for his behavior in the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile network market to virtual operators may also be lacking for the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points .
There is, of course, the relevant market analysis developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are the single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – logically at the end of the day – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators proceed in such strangely similar manner.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all traders they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps itself out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not promoted until the recently approved update of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that many experts expected this to improve the situation.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it, when no one is looking
While we do not realize the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually the companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the predetermined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-à-vis the operator appears as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, are presented, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with such a company," said Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned you can deal with thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
In other words, they get a non-indifferent profit from the activity of these companies and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have it in full as the regular customers of mobile operators.
But this should be a bit strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another issue opens for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has rights strong enough to expose similar activities and if it did not want to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer expensive
As the text has already said several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant reduction in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where traders were born, traditional traders tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were practically identical - too small market, to the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries it is precisely in these cases that the regulatory bodies intervened to defend not the mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then the creation of the first virtual operator was achieved and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing from one to the other the whole case like a boiling potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw the sponge.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could remain unharmed to the rejection (discrimination) of the other concerned.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful anthems.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" which he specifically chose to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to make sure that both, and even the choir, have the clear statement, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
The national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in Josef Kajetán Tyl's Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It has gained popularity and people have spontaneously made it theirs.
The first verse of the song since the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the date on which the first passengers in the subway, tram and bus will climb in place of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in their pocket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual one (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoint and at the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobyrov<0xC4><0x8D>e, eZA, Raj.
The cuts can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet at the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the internet service can completely forget the counters at the metro stops where they had to make long queues for paper tickets.
The cutting can be purchased via the Internet and on the Opencard it is charged to one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the Internet and will also register on their card the acquired credit," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to load the electronic slots on the Opencard in ATM and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, resemble the obliterators of the tickets and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The cutter will be checked instead by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cut, it will be loaded on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to Prague's integrated transport there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the time and zone validity," explained Filip's Ropid organization, which sets up Prague's collective transport schedules.
Urban buses have card readers embedded in the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at a certain point next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cuts, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the cut-off expires, can again go to the self-service ATM, where the cut-offs are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Germans of the Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This is the result of a letter deposited in the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Suede Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also the result of the letter kept in a private archive and now stored in the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the “district of <0xC5><0xA0>umava” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
“We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “The people who hold the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart.”
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudetenland hope only to brutality, to lack of regard, to misunderstanding, to oppression and to slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to always assume the protectorate over and over.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and roots out ethnic minorities and has contributed in no way, in fact in no way, to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the belief of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the control of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the then Sudeten Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least guess that it would be their removal from the republic, only a few of them admitted to such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the people of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to see him for him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that once they got home the Czech would make them comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, according to him counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign Will Attack Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet and on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
It wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect the emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his life in a moment of distraction.
The ads will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
“With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
You have to remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the hospital Na Homolce.
And that’s why we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warns.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for the return of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, that means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want to have the rubble or the flats on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people were killed.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is the prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
“Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to reach the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, (the Shia movement) of Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you cannot walk on the long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus of the company Student Agency, the question emerged whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s crash that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place on the bus, despite the fact that there were still two more seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the driving licence.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses do not have standing places, the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed to Aktualn<0xC4><0x95>.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the toilet during the race if they have the seat assigned," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law recognizes only the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," added spokesman Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this issue.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
It's all here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban where there are standing seats and the maximum limited speed, intercity buses with standing seats with the highest maximum speed and long-distance buses without standing seats with the maximum allowed speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards aboard the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Nor is it safe there when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can hit his head."
“If the bus does a sudden braking, of course the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the urban bus or tram.
The carrier must resolve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also intends that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession dangerous.
“As soon as I feel that I have to consider the stewardship as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce expenses,” he said.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
“We don’t have hostesses, we oppose from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up with a fatal accident," said less than a year ago T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
There has been an immense tragedy.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably exited the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver, but he hit him with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the stewarts' rest had been occupied.
"You can't reserve these seats in long-distance coaches, they're inevitable."
The company intends to denounce the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewards aboard the buses.
“But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not so much considered by coaches, they are more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of stewards as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transportation.
Dusseldorf hopes for Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, any such union could be a decisive impetus for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate its ability to act.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Authority for the Financial Supervisory Service, having long ago pointed out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is pressing for a future solution.
The connections between Deka-Bank, which the same customers of Savings Banks already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite some time, even on the part of Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the time of the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank like Helaba or West LB does not make sense.
But the board of directors of the Deka, which is half led by regional banks and consortia of savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
These could be market trades or parts of them.
The conversations, however, as they say in the business square, have just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of those that matter most in the business square in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a short time that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this association of three.
As soon as the projects were published, the Regional Bank of Hesse was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The other two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary that the different homes of the public sector are brought closer together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could take place first.
For Helaba this is not good news at all.
If it increases the pressure for other mergers, the partners will be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Turingia Savings Association, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has put the chain in the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses combine.
In June, Merl pointed out that the association of German savings banks had not yet given an answer to the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be secured.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which on the part of that, of course, is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luke it is the third or fourth time.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them, next to the 5l. barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massive beard and demonstrates to about 200 travelers what the deep tones are that it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena first gave Luca a kiss and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 23.45 with destination Monaco, Festa della Beer" , arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, says Marco, that it is not something for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with faux fur lining and a pair of glasses with silver wide sticks belong to the buses.
They have been going to the Oktoberfest for 5 years, this year there are 3 tours.
The night, day to the party, return at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian authenticity rules, the sickness check and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the Brennero.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly there is silence in the bus, the passengers are asleep.
Better yet, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means to run!", quotes Mark of the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, split into adjacent space!"
The bowl costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Demonstrate to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. we'll meet again here! Understood?"
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street, one attaches as you follow away the yellow hats to trees, road signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "Italian Weekend".
Exact data does not exist, there is talk of 50 thousand, who depart to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police is strengthened with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in the first place with 200 medical care before the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the curtain of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from turmoil in the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that support credits would reach as much as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state lender has refinanced itself in the very short term, according to a newspaper article – which is no longer possible due to market distrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had decreased by 95% to 2.37 million Euros, and the share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both demands and certain shares as well as the liquidation of provisions in loans decreased by more than 70% on 5 million Euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were stolen from Aareal Bank.
Given that the income in classical state funding was too low, Depfa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPP) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
Hypo Real Estate after the acquisition of Depfa is an important state and infrastructure funder.
It is more dependent on market refinancing among banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has largely dried up, as banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires for a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – short-term refinancing funds.
According to the notice of the Hypo Real Estate the financial needs of the group were covered by the credit for a certain period and the enterprise protected from the influence of the international monetary markets mostly non-functioning.
From other sources it is felt that thanks to the money the refinancing is assured until the end of 2009.
In contrast, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said the HRE Group will not need monetary markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still insured.
This is hoped for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and the gravity of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price fell by 75% at 3.30 Euro.
They run mortgage courses quite well.
While previous grade debts are almost unmovable, they give up the courses of postponed credits.
The most affected are the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo subsidiary, understandably the beginnings with maturity beyond 2009.
At first, the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa the crisis has come to pass, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an annuality depreciation by the deadline.
Or it comes into effect, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the case of information overturned due to partial stateizations, the almost certain probability has become a justifiable hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision to split up from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the report of losses for future payments of the compensatory surplus tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to attend Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start laughing: The German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new exchange log tells of Japan.
First day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a craving for going to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone and fortunately I didn’t miss it.
The beginning of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed as by us in Lower Saxony.
Students arrive slowly from 8:00 until a short interview with the professor begins at 8.40, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the guy who talks in front of people, in addition to a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I wore an old mother-in-law skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat down in front of the chair and tried to pronounce it well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, laughed and made a sign and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew this from my mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me nodded, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson had continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all spoke disorderly and laughed and dried me up with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the Japanese’s English.
In the pause, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket - it's different from boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
In fact, I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
Bento is not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Blessing made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to get to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I’ve been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a bit of the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I would come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and costumes.
They keep us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends – on the opposite side: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have never seen in my life.”
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees when they feel the danger.
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it happen if, when they behave in our same way, they have our same feelings?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years published articles of well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter into an impracticable territory, because the basis of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same thing as other animals, that is, pretends to be dead, escapes, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I can't believe this.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected to human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic particularity should appear in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the awareness of the animal, as it is done, will certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will put us in great trouble.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, it goes first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What, then, is outlined for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies working memory.
As such, feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In comparison, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities than the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the cerebral palate, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is incontrovertible.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear, probably feels so with the senses in both cases: but how could it happen, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
That is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleobrains, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the palaeoencephalo responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans: how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the neural level here, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotional person.
UEFA Platini president: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
Both host countries clash in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums for Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work at maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"The U.S. will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparations for the 2012 World Cup will not suffer from it."
Numerous members of the first division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end even had to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid
He wanted to promote to a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has grains with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared adultery her former Dennis Quaid.
He foams of anger and rebukes.
Delayed Roses War for ex-wife couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time commented on the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayal she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul's window" was Ryan's work with the press for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his being publicly declared adulterous husband was clear: he would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, which “Meg repeats and reworks the story of our relationship for the second time.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "were publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from the breakup, Quaid is married again and will soon become a father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing everything for the best."
Prices for air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and hotel overnight stays have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter it saw a noticeable drop in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already about 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year ago.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak dollar quote, which would have led to a "hardened desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with a 26.3% increase even hold the record in Europe
Also as far as flight prices are concerned, the trend in the first quarter is still up:
Due to the increase in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, airfare prices in the Economy Class fell on average by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the First Class and Business the price changes were far weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 % and fell by 23.6 % in the second quarter.
As for German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be, on the one hand, downward economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, due to the agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, there would be increased competition pressure.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes a go-to.
At Borussia Luhukay still can not find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing luck for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the cross.
His message was formulated accurately, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
It hadn’t happened much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying an even greater esteem than some old players.
And so his admonition also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
“Today here wasn’t everything nice to see,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted to be more relaxed.
For the 1-zero those of Hamburg have to thank the headshot scored by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the many weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg this Monday will turn 121 years old.
Spectators have already celebrated earlier, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the blinking ranking on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a party.
"We are able to put everything in order," said Marcell Jansen.
He has the feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric as well as Jansen blown at FC Bayern – slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol relishes.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily caused the Dow Jones to collapse by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later, the Down recovered a little bit again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market barometer was quoted/detected with a good 5% down on 10.579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was stagnant with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which gave us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell by just 10%.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the bailout plan, the financial funds were to be allocated for the collection of the so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one stroke, but in degrees.
By way of reference, the State had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an appropriate price trend , to reduce the charge for the state treasuries.

Dark matter affects the flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created confusion among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the rapidly freezing fuel pipes, she now suffers death from freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/pulse/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example from Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical incident as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised scholars for years now is that rockets do not behave quite as one would expect under the law of gravity.
There are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton firmly believes as before that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
“The cause of the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
Clearly, a force of attraction comes out of her, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is evident.
It itself is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially any visible light.
According to scientists’ calculations, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the abducted tourists in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a pre-release shooting, six kidnappers were reportedly killed.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for redemption are already underway.
The Germans are always on the lookout for kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of an expedition in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The backdrop of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear, so the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security official would have been ready to end the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
“The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It would be "only a treaty to take the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday had shot and killed six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would have been delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held in custody until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to take a position on the report.
The abuses of the father-in-law "led to suicide"
Years of father-in-law abuse led a woman to commit suicide, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested and ganged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was plagued by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle’s friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were “emotionally dead,” and that she had “wet with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father-in-law, who wrote a confessional letter ending: "I tied her up and tied her up."
"I didn't sexually molest her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
“This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn’t, it would have been hard for the facts to end up in court.”
I note the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was on his way from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the account of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after saving Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" that companies and their members have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the housing market are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk salt at 5 penny per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be a rise in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price hike this year, after a two-penny hike in February, and comes after a search conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Refusal of bail to former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges hanging against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is planned for the next few weeks but his party, the Awami League, has called for the country’s military-backed temporary government to give him total freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on her word, it is unclear under the terms of her release, if she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
“The high court has rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina by arguing that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on parole for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs the bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government sided with the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-polio campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to violence related to the Taliban, the UN says.
The U.N. launched a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition’s appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5 percent.
Previously, the Commission had stated that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney General's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Attorney General to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The operation took place when a case report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or verified," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been judged worse than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in prosecution against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegation of fraud to the detriment of Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting cases in court on behalf of the government.
They may be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for the dismissals, and finally resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials fired themselves.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he claimed primary responsibility in the dismissals, that he had relinquished his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to win the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocals that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number fifteen.
But the Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell album remained in the charts for nearly nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and runs north from First Road – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the lordly neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s conservation and development department, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the county municipal commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
"There may be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wants to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to use for a cafe where the real estate company hopes to lease the space.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this abandoned alley and turn it into a public fine," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802 when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps better known as the cover photo set of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was splendid," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, bunches of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about “gentrification” of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost unchanged city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Ending City"), published part of a City History Discourse that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, outgoing alley, dark even in the daytime, and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and windows with window sills, with weeks-old newspapers floating along the lowlands."
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilely through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lay next to a group of fresh, abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by have said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a bit embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this episode of Educative Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member at California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-speaking students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classes in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging the learning gap.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
School students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among fourth graders, a staggering 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
Equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama’s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes reviewing and exercising, constant assessment of skills, and a "no apology" attitude.
Moreover, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to pinpoint what it was like."
"It works," he observed, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate it in other schools with Hispanic majority and English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy within its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevents it from predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or banalize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in the morning.
Prices have lost more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety hit investors again on Monday after congressional leaders said they had reached a deal over the weekend on the biggest bailout plan in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic negotiations over the weekend had led to a bailout deal “seem to have failed to revive the market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption home due to slowing economic growth, reducing forecasts for oil and gas prices by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter sets a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets’ uniform in the past eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the grey of the threatening clouds that overwhelmed them with a wild game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12 yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing tuning has taken a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles played catch-up games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a wandering pitch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith foresaw another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced a fumble from Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely scored a goal of 20 yards, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were told - the Jets conceded 21 points without an answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie at rest breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the favourably flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 for 27 seconds, last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such an amazing career that it has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect – that air pollution would make his asthma problems worse.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect condition - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a burning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half sprinters like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distance, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa do Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of workouts.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been criticized—especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival—for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, counting on apripista as if it were a mid-range race, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathoner.
With the pace paced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselassie after the aprilists disappeared.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but was cured to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a great detachment, picking them up after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendour, noise, huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and the home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described – and that makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a separate place.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what he's missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain distrustful of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of rural Southern Black culture—sometimes despised, sometimes rewarded—born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama.
Low as a big box in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Outside the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always cared about, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly, this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora used to say it like it was," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls whom Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moving to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston plunged into the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of decent clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were whispering.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on his chair in the backyard above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaqueless tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big commemorative ceremonies, and no big conferences.
"I don't think they understand her contribution to the world or her legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a 2003 Hurston biography.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officers wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane highway.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city’s western boundary.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended its idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's home door.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff to the people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a crocodile out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office as "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that the segregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of his youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural divide there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons – black writer, actress and artist who surpassed prejudices, as she did, with joyful self-confidence and lines like: “How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk through Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit the bookshelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The design of the highway came just as his most famous daughter had turned the lights on again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its road project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project has helped to change the image the city has of itself.
Those from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-story bookstore (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things—such as the murals on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, that make black men appear in the fields—do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fear their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of civic pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"A lot of people, if they just got in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all fluently talk about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that glass offices, beehive over their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst “ugly day in the office” since the 1929 collapse.
The factories shake metal carts for the tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts stretched hung on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4pm and 7pm on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned the affair so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk,to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the large Macy's warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from smaller banks from places they commute from, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches only operate within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and as New Yorkers head home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved her.
The employees and contractors who stood in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were shifting their money to a bank perceived as a safe harbor, the bank that is asking for more bailouts on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become proficient in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the porter in uniform, almost fifty years old of my condo, has changed the subject from our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I’ve changed, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs like those representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned a lot in national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some tombs, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance to Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Austrian Alliance for the Future, campaigned with tickets vehemently anti-immigration and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of the continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
A trip abroad banned by Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the controlling authorities that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent police last Thursday after it provided evidence to magistrates of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Prefecture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Prefecture, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offenders register.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible moves in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have the right complete systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicts for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he had to embark on a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not let him passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the prefecture of Uxbridge, west of London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him in the sex offenders register.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flying, no clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or stage performers.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these great ones you do not need to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own concept of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, exhibited these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are featured in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, get to know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gambling"
It is set in places he still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is dealing with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has crossed the Amazon.
The writer, who has always been a favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a risk" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
“If I had good sense, I wouldn’t write it, but I’ll do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible,” he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the prominent figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by attendees – an ancient edition of Dickens’s book “Our mutual friend” – filled the seats at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public who had fled the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond";
The Hispanic-American novelist, has acknowledged that "there is no way" Frivoli's own "freedom" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, stating that, on the contrary, "it's called for more people" and that "it's called for more people."
Time hampers the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has raged against this Festival preventing us from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
The sign included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after taunting with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the blockade in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers give the alt to the two occupants of a van, who instead of stopping, give up on the escape.
The officers instructed the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement of the Department of the Interior of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were conducting a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, accelerated abruptly and crossed the stopping point.
The officers pursued the vehicle until after a couple of kilometers, it stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note of it once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panets, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the registration had been "duplicated" since it did not coincide with that reported in the van's documentation, the arrested person was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Influence
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers as she tried to drive out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a California highway spokesman told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "squeezed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuvers back and forth.
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who at first glance had apparently not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and was getting out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the agents took her to a drug and alcohol use specialist center to test her.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has been collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been ruled out from the outset, although "according to what officers observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some medication."
The Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to take a decision on the case of the former advisor to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the charge of clientism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been until now an advisor in the Seville council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Blood of May", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’s Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish uprising against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in the cinemas, to become a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims that he realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and he feels that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before filming a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd May of this year.
The 15 million budgets allocated for the whole of the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the sets and costumes appropriate to portray a "stupid Spain that misguided the choice of the leader for whom to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the set he had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual practice of working, staging with actors, with whom he often uses to try before filming together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and the cinema where he is working to know what is in the industry."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the Sangre de mayo cast, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Nominated for four Oscars - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos -, should instead represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema.
From this film Garci is not expected any prizes.
“At first you think you’re working for the posterity, then you realize you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you just settle for making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillan essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A dancer from Seville pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have loved to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible to me."
The dancer says: “We do not intend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tango.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also fits into this aesthetic,” he explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as face in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with her who had been a pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because she agreed to work on my work and I’m very honored for that.”
The setup also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompaniment to all those states.
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially at that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, usually, he resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who’s had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers her, let alone considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will start today, at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diario de un poet recién casado" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Cultural Advisory Board of the Andalusian Council to celebrate the "Triennium of the Five of Zenobia and Juan Ramon's awards" (2006).
Thus, the "Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May with the International Congress and which, after having reached the various provinces, will be held in New York.
In addition, the Cultural Advisory Council of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the Andalusian poets of the highest value.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
And yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He was also known to be very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country have been able to be better thanks to its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and the homeland died at a particularly dark time, for fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperately looking for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men so without virtue and still good people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and an advocate of lost and won causes, from the Drug Fighting Foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the home and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, caring neither for nationality nor for passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man did not die, an era ended.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has left a very high-level example for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and having a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try it and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful although he certainly did not miss the opportunities to not be.
"Why am I going out to eat a hamburger today, if I have a steak at home?" he joked.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles I played, none were as proud of as that of a devoted husband, loving father, earnest grandfather, and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'd say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were later taken into account at the time of the assessment and I had to examine it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the backbone, which was supposed to go before.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if you’re forced to go, it’s to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, I don't.
You had to go only to get the back (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had T-shirts only size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inept compared to the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that more than 11,000 people are waiting for.
So, as was predictable, the race began that we had not even yet deposited the backpack, although, once we succeeded in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I guess, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it won’t come into my mind.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move the company within the camp.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group attendees into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group she is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will be at his disposal soon.
All without a blue screenshot.
Awesome.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week there has been a lot of talk about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “the least”.
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continually added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the web, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same job as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps you need to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take your computer to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and we spend more time browsing the web every day than in a remote window environment.
What is half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I give you a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreational facilities for Microsoft employees, in Redmond, earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, it was confirmed the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be put on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the apparitions of the stars, we can evoke the image of the forced with the sharp whiskers lifting weights in the walking circus.
This is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the cotton interior, cuffed and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" stands out compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable), which the most iconic models of the T-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable), which the most iconic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And beware, because the production of the Belgian company does not concern only the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara t-shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a pity to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish home?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their own clothes. I do this often.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, although in the end, everything conflues and there are many elements in common.
When I was a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to search my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better even than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and the professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into crisis?
No, no, no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted to do as a child and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me to be a mother and I also want to be a young mother, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will be to give my son a lot of happiness and to educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you’re waiting for a few movies shot last year to come out in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to come out "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see if you like it
A few days ago, you made your debut on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the dresses we performed – I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO Nao.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm to you that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part that you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help third world women, you can't pull back.
Recurrent drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if he does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General’s Office, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a course of rehabilitation on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Seguridad del Automotive (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving then return to driving the car.
Alcohol would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to put a stop to these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, no doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17:40, second schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias traveled landed in the presidential hangar at the airport Benito Juárez in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced me to use my hand as a visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the road, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
- No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 Navy soldiers who offer the honorary greeting.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they have reported that in Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing into the room where the official party awaits them.
At the door of their hotel, one of the four largest in the city, aspiring Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion prize, than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivan stylist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with excitement.
Moreover, it is the second largest store of the company in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite canvases, Mango’s presidential gala table was even more spectacular.
Born with a broken heart and making of necessity virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some accessories of ELAH to take his breath away and at the arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters tall - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and mistress of Mango, did the honors of house and knight which ended, along with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in pants and shirts – drawn by her hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and she was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the essays "she had a balloon, she had a balloon and she
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us first the photos of her son on the mobile.
The next day we were delighted with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy moving on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having made sure beforehand that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they’re all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to libraries on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it is even worse to imagine being involved in the hectic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of getting rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole "menu" of options tailored to each one's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach libraries thanks to publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" disproves this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as staying in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline isn’t already flowing into your veins to find your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but it really doesn’t matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called sleepiness.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nighttime enuresis (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful situations or over-excitation.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or that the opposite happens (screaming, screaming, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, however, is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcit the baby before going to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiresome to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleepers appear they try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will not get anything, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it might lead.
Never tell your child that you might ask him/her questions at night to learn his/her secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Such a thing causes a great anguish.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory at home after a long, fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks have created the most networked opportunities, turning one of them into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves with difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to get the best and one after another provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain top and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a midfield block, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the point of attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais net for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, it took a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the 11 of the Illhaeusern, just backed up to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Britain.
In front of the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will come forward with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place just at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Brittany fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president will "discuss with them about possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and remuneration of sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted “snail operations” in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
On the peninsula of Quiberon a road block has been implemented.
The sailors have already proved their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking steps to protests in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire-Atlantique, interrupted the blockade of the notorious Total Donges refinery in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the planned meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they do not intend to move to Paris," said, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is reached only with a gasoline less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have greeted film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer counts 215 deliveries this year, despite recession threats that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth largest airline in the sector, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first semester, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, backed up by the U.S. monetary authorities, would sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider selling most of its assets, in addition to handing over the life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation has been obtained at the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to divest include the aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No definitive decision has been made on such transfers, FT continues.
The AIG needs to get liquidity quickly in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the U.S. authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: Chronicle of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson plan to rescue financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a decline never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst of the losses in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchange following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the leading technology stock index, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street is plunged after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to bring stability back to markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans have rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All of this signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying... then the witness would be quickly passed on to the Fed – the Federal Reserve – and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And further highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
Following the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favor of the banks of the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of 10-year Treasury bonds declined to 3.632%, compared with 3.827% on Friday evening, while that of 30-year bonds fell to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama wins first TV duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates, here’s a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though meritorious, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them think Obama is the winner, while 25% are betting on McCain.
An excellent performance by his fellow list member Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm on Thursday Obama's lead.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never ceased to promote his indisputable foreign policy experience, stressing the opponent’s “naiveness” regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he has often stated on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What since yesterday is a continuous target for the republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he repeated this weekend in a Democratic spot, reproaching the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a torrential rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s economic intuition to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street upheavals, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
With prudence, the two candidates skipped the questions centered on the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night just after the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative.
While still awaiting the results, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they have not even voted: "For what benefit? They will do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that this regime, which has taken a good stand in front of foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian executives and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the stripping of votes," said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a 12-party alliance.
"It's a change of face," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case it's the executive.
If some members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the poll.
It stresses that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has given way to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you not noticed that there were elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five MPs from the opposition in parliament, the most convenient ones in power."
The silence of the night falls on the square in October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are delighted with their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the infected blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such drama and popular protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, directed by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at shedding light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminating recommendations to prevent the resurgence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was delayed in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee to devise a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever relationship, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and the Société canadienne du sang (Société canadienne du sang) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to ongoing efforts to improve the safety of blood tests and field research over the next few years, we have regained public confidence," she said, proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec already had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says she who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for some years, it has been shown that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us so much that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to that in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them has thus significantly decreased.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by a transfusion is detected.
I believe that today we can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also provide enough.
“The needs are increasing as the population ages.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors who make up on average only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory that can meet the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But the members of this group of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it is hard to find an hour to donate blood," says depressed Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec which manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abounds blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth cord blood sample and we expect to take more than a thousand of them each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection practice as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed to not be able to access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A, winning 3-1 against the Sounders of Seattle yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a goalless first time on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the following goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
On Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler scored a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed on the day.
In short - Kovalev's Decisive Network
The Canadiens and their aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the preparatory games of the Hab.
Decisive for the victory the only network signed Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to sneak in the first half," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation.”
Charest Points to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the Liberal Party’s general council, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of today’s partial elections.
"Expanding the borders of our last great northern border": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday at Levis, by means of instruments with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image Mill".
On three maxi screens, spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc. were confused.
It's as big as a full-fledged election campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first labor agreement with France, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the prime minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, has only explained why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but has not commented on timing or investment quotas, nor has he explained what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At the very least, he pointed out what he believes deserves a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That “large territory twice as large as France” is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us,” he insisted, as if to solicit a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
“There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government,” he said.
"Given climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would serve their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when “common visions will be provided.”
Northern development would, moreover, adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The Nord Plan will be “concerned, ordered and respectful of the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another reference, conservative this time, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest clarified that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will do it," he told his militants, arousing applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, particularly in a Federal Council mission to China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly as oil: the PLQ above all demands the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the North Plan has been skeptical.
PQ leader Pauline Marois has dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If she had, "we would have made progress today," said Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
“What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a show,” said leader Sébastien Proulx, deputy of Mario Dumont, on his return from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, the former minister of "Justice" (iron of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the entourage of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only one of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated a citizen of its own detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, renounces its word and lets a child-soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
For information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the return of Omar Khadraffin to be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of oppression.
He doesn’t realize it yet, but we’re witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and “democracy,” a word that Harper keeps boasting and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we are at a time when there is no more morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a minority head of government until today (to see what will happen after October 14th...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see this government giving up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame is right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and CEO of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small squatted publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, writers and the publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend a considerable amount of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the nearly bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Incidentally, in these odd-armed struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that would overwhelm the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that it should have presented its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates usually take place with an exchange of views and not at a whim.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is well evident?
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the perfumed lawyers and not to the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even defamers have a right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports Black Canada’s authors and publishers does so primarily because they reject the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to the Barrick and to judge, but based on civilian exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of ambush (searching for the "public debate", the Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum urging them to suspend the parutil...
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrack Gold lawsuit constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies in blocks the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are uncomfortable to the richest companies in the world, punishing multiple lawsuits, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific norms as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, just as it is affected by the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic party, have finally reached an agreement on the biggest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a brake on the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of pending homes for non-payments, as well as a right to inspect the salaries paid to managers of protected companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis in Wall Street,” he said.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, invaluable discomfort and upset would have spilled over the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their discontent with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with having added some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to maintain their home and the one inherent in salaries for executives of state-covered businesses.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he would vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“As far as I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unselling assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages ( mortgages ), then extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA ) and resulting in the freezing of liquidity and the dismantling of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who aired the first draft of a deal last week.
They seem to have come out of that dead end since Democrats agreed that the “toxic” assets of some companies in trouble are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision has been added that if the government should face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote from Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will earn him dividends in the event of a profit and that he will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and departure allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the plan’s architects would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be released.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and Democratic level.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Don’t take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the caucus of the skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in complete bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) due to the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the 10 largest insurers.
“It’s not about the money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this period, on the other end of the Channel, the British government seems on the verge of nationalising another bank in the grip of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the loans currently underway at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalisation by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty with blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor, of the glamorous smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful consecrated to true sacred monsters.
What a constant.
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fastest years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Often magical children are born from mixed couples.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the latest quality brand.
Because in him was recognized an entire country invaded by the safe made man, the warrior of the Pacific war, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the motorist who ranked second at the 1979 24 Hours of Mans, as well as sex symbol, although part of a 1958 model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadow zones of a secret, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of show-business, of which you will never be able to fully unravel the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman’s disappearance was a heartbreaking hit for filmmakers, while his big characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is being re-proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cow-boy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are confused in memory in The Cat on the Roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that didn’t keep what he had promised.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up There Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's 1961 film The Color of Money, which earned him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, it was hers.
Still him.
The epochs follow through its path.
Young people know him mainly for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a final role as the Irish mafia godfather in Era My Father, in 2003.
Unlike the finest film legends who soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its splendour, parties, and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging exaggerated his performances.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic characters or desperate, of which he expressed dismay and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, humble sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, from 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, she drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and sad.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunman Robert Redford (they had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with endless sadness, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love of life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift is thus extinguished.
We will have stripped her face of sticking out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the proceeds from those sales were destined to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of leaning on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that read, “Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.”
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it was equally a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Soci invoice factory?
On October 8, the hearing of the criminal case against János Zuschlag and partners will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within a criminal association that caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the execution of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million florins, ended up partly in the boxes of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method disclosed by the investigating authorities, they collected the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these, the invoices were then prepared to be sent to the tenders, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Much of this is the work of István Lados and András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has mainly drawn up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados's "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the caterer, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later referred to as Együtt at Armadik Évezredért, is full of formal errors and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however, the invoice included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fancy invoices exaggerated when they reported to Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, whose accounting - according to the information given to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to proxy and shown the invoices, he immediately realized that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT match of our company were at the wrong point."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the way, the bill was catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The assisted invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as shown during the survey, VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company must apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, furthermore, the employees of the hotel issued only hand-printed invoices.
In addition to this, the "issuers" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the Prosecutor's Office, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Also for formal defects - due to non-conform invoice format, false stamp - it has been found that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Armadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there, which is why the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he issued that invoice.
They deliberately issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He has also collaborated with Zuschlag and partners of the currently in liquidation Biogate Kft, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florins to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület economic association, behind which there was no real activity.
Neither movement of money because the prepared invoices were then cancelled, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their own documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to be contacted by the general director of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with fuel trade and automobiles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media, for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the investigation data, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas in liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would submit the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Armadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the counter-value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because, according to the defendant, they had not received work.
The companies were useful to him, however, because at the request of the co-indicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generación.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov has cashed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont tender.
Y-Generación and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a tender for the public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
To prevent this from happening, they presented five fake invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the Prosecutor's office, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It must be seen if it is in his interest, it may also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the goat the atonement.
Zuschlag could also have been offended by the fact that his requests to alleviate his imprisonment conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrests, have so far not been answered.
While the perpetrators of non-compensatory commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can walk freely or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Bidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York have managed to discover the neuro-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in Science magazine, men don’t want to stay behind in a competition like eBay’s auction, so they’re available to pay even a higher price.
The research attempted to trace the nervous pattern of this “match” at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in a auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex enters intensively into operation when you lose to the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the stretched body.
To support their theory, the group’s economists conducted a financial follow-up survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
To the control group they reported how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
In addition to this, they promised that in the event of a win, they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the group members would lose the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss was emphasized.
By checking the neuroscientists' hypothesis, the members of the team who played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winning".
"These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These, in fact, so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
In Hungary the number of patients with hepatitis amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are cured: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and caused diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leaks, saliva).
It is useful for travelers to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots form on the skin and on the white of the eyes, stools become clear and dark urine, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens deceptively destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed people.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease is worth talking to your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by disease associations.
The purpose is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and to as many atheists, while everyone was observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's handkerchief painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among the believers, while the painting of Leonardo was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and was considered to have a tranquilizing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time zone received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "have calmed down and were permeated with peace".
Looking at the religious image they realized 12% less pain than when they had before them the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you need to find the right image.
“We have to look for an image that they feel very positive towards, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality,” Wright said.
After the excellent results remains only the question whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of similar calibre is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what hospital they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, this is not enough.
As for the skeptics comparing it to the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t really see the substance of Web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to comply with the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “we put all the information in the world into one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what’s going to happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to know how to answer questions like “what do I do tomorrow?” or “what would be the right job for me?” but the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their search on the Internet, exactly the words they search for are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can e.g. store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these will then in the long run generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is being used against me, if they look at what I do? - asks users concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the reactions of Internet users are caused by the fear felt by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
However, a fact is confirmed and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, sighed for relief in May when the firm – in agreement with the EFF Electronic Legal Protection Association – successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later, you cannot force Google at any point in the constitution to provide any information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped off nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain individual user search lists and the entire two-month list of web pages and keywords.)
The judgement of Google is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data wipe out Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and private life by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users appearing in numerous countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, as long as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up-to-date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 talks about nothing but collaboration, to intentionally leave traces behind us and take advantage of the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his music tastes, all of these can fit them into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries automatically appear on stock.
In the meantime, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, comes easily to know with who has spent the night her perfidious boyfriend or a company can lay off his employee because he has written a sincere opinion on the company's summit.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google’s monopoly can do so (starting with, for example, Scroogle using Google’s search engine but at the same time not voluntarily leaving traces).
There are not a few people who do not intentionally sign up to community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
The public is not even waiting so secretly for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies only, the services introduced at the time of gross but do not cause bad memory instead.
However, the critical observers next to all this the regime find alarming points: the company summit for example has completely rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the rule of the company asylum, has considered too expensive the repeated restoration to the daily pleasure of the employees, but all this reduces the interest of the government and the fact that in 2006 the company has to pay attention to the results.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, but one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines of Google will assume such proportions in the future, that the company will soon find itself in the system.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled tale of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double murderer make traces disappear
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, suspected on grounds of helping to erase the traces of the crime, said a spokesman for the Borsod Police Quest on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, they are currently accused of favoritism.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, defend themselves freely.
Favorable treatment is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated pluri-homicide for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, for this reason last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
Police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the list of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell within a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the Polish supply represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, an offer has so far been made by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>eská Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the US president who was unable to compact his party behind a law that was swiftly dumped, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire super-funder Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even part of the press in Madrid sees the expiatory goat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the world will suffer from it later.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - mentions the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to slumpy financial institutions and with taxpayers’ money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control over the dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxiety that European taxpayers, similar to Americans, will also have to put their hands on their wallet to remedy the crisis seems more real.
So far, the EU has not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" do not have to sweep away the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion right away, however, it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
Intelligent Machine Imitates Squirrel Flight
What could be the best method to develop collision protection technologies if they do not imitate the obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the slingshots gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic impetus on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-car with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development, explained at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction.
The engineers drew on the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of the bee's sight.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the robot senses the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, in a way different from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If it weren’t for that, the robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the more harmful and innermost layer of the shield, within which the collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in a blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to the bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a high energy density, which means that their lifespan is longer than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few dozen Kb.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a collision avoidance technology that, according to Nissan, can be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Further application possibilities can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system, which by avoiding obstacles on the road leads to the destination.

The written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Act has been drafted for the purchase of disproportionate claims, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new deals extended until midnight on Saturday on the east coast, congressional leaders decided on a $700 billion bailout plan after a days-long debate.
We have taken serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the American House of Representatives, according to which it is only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Speaking about the result of the compromise, Treasury Minister Henry Paulson said: The program will work and will be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about reversing the economic tank.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (at 2 p.m. on Monday night in Central Europe time), but it did not bring about much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 concerning the program, then it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then happily welcomed the White House news of the deal.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which predicted that $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now, as a first step, you can spend at most half of the sum of $ 700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of Congress, with which the Ministry of the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credit behind, the fate of the remaining $ 100 billion will decide the president.
A special college will oversee the program in which the Federal Reserve president also participates.
Spending the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can apply a combined tactic: it can buy loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans at the same time.
The purchase can be made through auctions and in a direct way - they announced competent of the ministry.
The legal norm makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an adequate price for the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their good outing, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, furthermore the limitations depend on how the Treasury Department will offer the help.
Essentially, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose an overtax on the golden parachute, if they do not retire the defunct bank director.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing contracts of the golden parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general managers - commented the measure the Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also win if the economy, and together with it the saved bank, will recover.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that sets out how to reimburse taxpayers for expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, there have been those on both sides who have expressed their doubts about the project.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic counterpart Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same ones who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industry prices continue to rise.
Prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Institute of Hungarian Statistics.
The export sales prices of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, compared with the previous year they decreased by 3.9%
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales reported the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimum, 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and footwear production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high level of the price of plastics and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemicals sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimal extent in the processing of wood (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, primarily due to the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, taking into account the domestic sales of the sectors of the manufacturing industry, the largest increases were in the sector of the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metalworking products, the price increase was 13.2% and 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which is a determining factor.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of tools and electrical machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the manufacturing industry in the past year, prices have risen by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector surpassed last year’s prices by 18.7%.
In domestic sales among sector target groups, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods, prices have risen by 0.3%, in the energy and after-use sector, prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the larger price increase was observed in the energy and after-sales sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins rose 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared with 3.9% in 12 months.
In one month, the Hungarian florin weakened against the euro by 1.7%, compared with the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 and strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12th the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement may enter into force - the foreign minister talked about it in Chicago with Hungarian local representatives.
According to him, "now everything depends on the fact that the electronic entrance and control system is built in time."
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no more entry permits, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand the Medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain are also in favor of the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, pledged their support Sunday for the $700 billion government plan to rescue banks, but there are politicians demanding the treasury minister’s resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the days-long marathon negotiations on Sunday night announced that they had reached a principle agreement on the bank bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the freezing financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more fit than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues, Obama has again regained some advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s appointment as vice president, has disappeared.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that have also been supported by him.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industries, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
It has not escaped defining outdated McCain’s economic ideas.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that “all of us who are going to send this situation down with difficulty ... but doing nothing is not a road to go.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a committee of control of the finance minister and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a merit role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-conscious - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-Socialists have modernized Bavaria for decades and it is precisely now that these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005 again in the period of the mentioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequential modernization in the region, which devours parents.
Sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they made a lot of mistakes in time, but the secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities, and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups themselves have moved away from the CSU: the free professionals, the artisans, the graduates and the graduates.
Here, support for the CSU fell below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal political situation created after the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens do not yet want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been held, now it revolves around the coalition; in the debate broadcast on public television, party leaders have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he would like to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice chancellor.
As you stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open thing in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, leader of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, reiterated that he was open in all directions.
“To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for governing,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris began the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MP of the European People's Party in her message to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and, by the way, the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
The French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
Invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz EP, recalled, in addition to the discrimination in hiring, that Roma are being expelled from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a ridiculous number of them can achieve a higher degree."
Mr Járóka also stressed the key role of education in the promotion of human rights as a fundamental human right.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the wider context between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the greater their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on income and consumption, they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"European citizenship law for Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the union of the purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe," she said.
As part of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities held every year since last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a single forum to promote the anti-discrimination and equal opportunities objectives set at the state and European level.
CSU: Pity for a Transitional Period
At the end of October, the fate of the impudent Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, heads have not yet fallen, at the top of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed for the moment the discussion of personal issues.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it clear in any case that they will not be attacked with all their strength at the chair.
They have thus attempted to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the peak of his career, the Christian-Social Union got 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region of crucial importance to the Hungarian economy always count, in the future they will be forced in any way to unite.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a seat in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exponents of right-wing values for a possible government coalition.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislature whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for a coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber, who had previously been plotting in the shadows, will also get an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements to the son-in-law to the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be chancellor after the elections to the Bundestag scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is not re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, which does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still persists.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Neither an opposition representative entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of the well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been free of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time "with the constitutional amendments discussed in the 2006 elections.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition there was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the pipelines in possession of the Beltransgaz that cross the country, could improve the relationship with the EU's non-political rank.
It referred to a relaxation that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, had focused on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could practically not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: the political prisoners were released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus already forms a two-country on the map, considers the states a federal state.
We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Aleksandr Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "the power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a weightless parliament".
The opposition does not foresee protests for the results, but rather tries to send the message to voters of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the main security class officially the most helped, that of the pensioners, he considers the social regime that is adequate.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time for the disintegration of social security "reminiscent of burial silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were swivel doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure takes place against the cunning, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new antifannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," the minister said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of sliding doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta’s words suggest, smiling, “a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.”
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister says that "in three months the absences due to sickness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people at work in one year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
In Italy, "whose salary dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service flags today numbers about the smallest absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of 'working fawns' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree.
In particular, the TAR will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatment for sickness dependent on service; the extension of the time slots of the sick worker, within which check visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirms that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "living appreciation for the constant commitment of the association in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
“Of course, an outraged ‘enough’ has arisen, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness on the part of young people facing the world of work are of particular importance.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to slow down in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment aimed at putting an urgent end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we do not want this “downward trend” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is loosened that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that, on a general level, too little is still being done to counteract the phenomenon of injuries and the counteraction can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, more controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world".
"An additional effort is needed - he added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it requires a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli also denounced the "progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection envisaged for the victims of work" and the "assistanceal drift towards which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneities or allowances from time to time ordered by the legislator".
MP3 players accused of putting their hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, citing the opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csserri), published today in a statement released in Brussels.
"From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the loud volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high levels of audibility may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings, a clear risk emerges and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by it.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music equipment and related equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
You can greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment if they listen to loud music for only 5 hours per week (more than 89 decibels) exceed the currently in force limits for maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno launches Commission for the Future of the Capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and represents all political, social and cultural ideas - he emphasizes Alemanno - He will have to make proposals for an idea of development of Rome, which the political decision-makers, who remain the council and the municipal council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, his contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of the daily life and on emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, from a deeper perspective, working with seriousness on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design of reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a real leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look far beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who holds us to be independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.
“Obama has a big, tough face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!”
In reality, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly attacks of a racial nature and don’t answer the question of voters: Will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
There are people who speak with the heart, but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the south of the United States wrote an editorial: Once in the cockpit to vote, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
There is a side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll think about where to put the crusade, whether it’s on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before now, which almost certainly appears the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
It changed America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
In the United States, the economic downturn is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Nowadays, most journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the journalists did not openly state that they felt less concerned about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as intended by the general public is not to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism permeates the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishing houses open a gateway to the internet, for many to see as the "killer" of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted they are embracing the technology in the hope that it “does something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between who runs the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
Staff reporters are up 30%.
That of "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it”, take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach a total of 15 days after a number of years.
But American journalists, according to their admission, often get “sick” during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA AT GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl escalation counter-impact investigation.
In the course of his trial, last week, he obtained the release from the housekeepers transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the realtor could travel the route from the provincial town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the PM gave an opinion contrary) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms this by informing us that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of the South, and strong in the Central and Central states.
The soul, by the way, which has become arrogantly alive with the vow of which I spoke at the beginning.
But this is only an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps foretells or already lets us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the US and in Europe the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of long-incubated phenomena that in the new climate solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, yes, close ties with abroad, but that first and foremost see the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or has little to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union, which, as usual, is divided between the different interests and between the different state strategies and cannot decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all disbursement of funds: since when it comes to the narrows it is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in the sixth place.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization will ever have a similar amount.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, after all, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to take account of those things that are very little immaterial.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but are still absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So those who find themselves to be sovereign certainly possess several more cards than those who are not, to those who are unlucky to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which foreshadows a fracture.
He who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need of authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into their own hands.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, especially economic ones, proved so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and, in a certain sense, disturbing: a discredit, an insufficiency, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
In other words, it seems that the belief that before their actions are the same as the ideas of the social elites so far in existence, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the general sense of the term, to have made their time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority, is becoming more and more common.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and of the traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and most recent times.
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, someone would say, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what from today is not taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis may be regurgitated.
In the face of all this, to speak of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
Keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The super glue for walking on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glazed paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the paws of these reptiles and at the same time "easily detaches from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
“This material could be useful as a transient adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a microfiber-like adhesive that self-cleans from dust when moving on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Medications: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
To reaffirm the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: it is enough to reduce a glass of juice of grapefruit and grapefruit.
Grapefruit juice had already ended up being blamed because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
The same Italian Medicines Agency reported this in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to be careful what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPER - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that may change the information notes of the drugs.
Therefore, always read the leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert stressed to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the leading critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days of Enron's failure, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was rebuilt to the economist, but that has now proved to be correct.
"I'm surprised and also a little shocked at the speed at which the memory of scandals like the Enron or Worldcom collapse has vanished from public attention," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “great-value economist” but also a dissenter with a “very aggressive, particularly critical style against the Bush administration’s liberal excesses.”
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystems watches, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several novelties: the welcome screen and the interface revised and rendered less spartan, more substantial ones are added, such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system version, and the standard O format support.
Also paying attention to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some features specific to some forms such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e-mailing them, for example, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing form, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the text editor, each contributor is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review.
Some companies are also working to bring some of OpenOffice’s features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be shipped to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of freelancing can be a draw for the spread in homes, it is precisely in the business field that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, since it can already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of realities that offer a training, consulting and support service ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulator presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
A new case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the shirt of the best climber.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccó and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also he of Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the checks confirm the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of Kohl’s positive attitude to the third generation Epo.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRATE:NEW YORK TIMES IS ITALY RAZIST?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" received with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also “the country’s highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support for the Northern League”.
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants the Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rents up to 900 euros for a room
The university rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants’ union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to trigger a general process of increase".
In most cases, the rental offers also contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, related sub-rents.
Extraordinary measures are needed for Sunia which, through the revision of the taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it goes from a minimum of 650 (Nere Bande area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 euros for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the main universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed it takes 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, such as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee asked for foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities erase the historical halls
Historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multisale and the consequent death by consumption of the monosale in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inevitable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory,"it is as if he was missing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the street and so many emotions", observes the director of New cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago was worth to Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and which tells the story of the no salava for the province
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay for the major scotto are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, “it is useful that new structures are built, but we should ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendees are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the operators: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote the monosaal cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules envisaged are tax relief measures in favour of the operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
"It's an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counteract the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional halls also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have lived so many shared emotions, to not see the signs blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonize the choices of the Municipality with the interests of the Piromalli cosca".
The accusations made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association are heavy.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the same as the boss, already convicted for association for mafia criminals, sentenced to compensation of 10 million euros.
"In disregard of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted the cusca - write the judges - to enter officially within the municipalities, facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and of address of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional council, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are many collusiones between local authorities and organized crime" in his region: "There are areas where the intensity of the mafia is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.”
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved from the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been elected head of a coalition of center-right, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli cock had even come to ask for the change of the project of the A3.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the PMs, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration with the interests of the basket".
When the energy is born from the waves now the big ones come into the field.
It is an endless deposit, which occupies over 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have set their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, giants like the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, at the same time as the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental urges and the new rise in oil give momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore wind farms.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be the currents and tides.
I collided with the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a U.S. oil giant company told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a signal not least, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York's Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey's Ocean Power are on the road to energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, though not known in detail, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still at the dawn, also so that marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boe connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the boe up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four plants of this type under construction, awaiting only federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, have already invested $7 million in 2008 and planned investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
