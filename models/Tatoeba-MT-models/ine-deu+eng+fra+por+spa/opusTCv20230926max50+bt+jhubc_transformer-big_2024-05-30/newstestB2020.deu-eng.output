Fire extinguished in French chemistry plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy announced on Friday. The fire broke out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in operation with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped.
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. At the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are especially produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Selini, who is under the auspices of the EU-Buffet and
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak escaped the gas methanthiol and the surrounding area smelled far-reachingly of lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil were poured into the city's wastewater system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and gave up her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. For 57 days the dog was missing any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left the dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put the dog in panic
In hopes that Katie might still be staying at the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out of the room.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog, but from days to weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance The poor Carole King got a call: A man called me and said that Katie had found herself in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly stood out her bitch under a tree. "I just hugged her, I didn't want her to go inter", he said.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. The remainder is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" scale.
Weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again in the Bundeswehr, many of them without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary of State Peter Tauber of the CDU, so far two weapons, one part and 3474 shot ammunition have reappeared. The still missing weapons and weapons parts are, among others, machine guns type M3.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Federal Armed Forces was found to be "terrifying", said Left-Bundestag MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since in the course of investigations hardly anything had been found again. The Left-Politician also spoke of a "poor balance sheet, which was criticized by Renner."
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. As a destination port, Port Rashid was given to the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been charged by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19, on charges of violating security provisions, but it was suspected that by doing so, Iran was making a controversial, temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the Strait of Hormuz. Tensions in the region had become immensely exacerbated in the past months. The commercial shipping has been in conflict with the United States and Iran. It came to Zheng Zheng
Merkel pays tribute to people’s courage in the peaceful revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, brave citizens would have shaken up the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction.
Musk aims for extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record, with the electric car group losing last year despite a delivery boom.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter continued. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. To do this, Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. This is how strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, in the current and upcoming quarter, six-digit numbers are required. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses last.
Mysteries solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the large brain prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this out using experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. In doing so, progress has also been made in the question of why children resist tickle so vigorously, only to last longer.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand triggered laughter even before the touch, this is due to a deep layer in the large brain, which already triggers laughter when expecting the tickling.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats react with "laughing" in the ultrasound range when they are teased by humans. This "laughing" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touch
Until now, however, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why humans cannot nibble themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the large cerebral cortex are the impulses to be suppressed in the self-touch.
But if the self-touch and the touch of others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people can not actively tick themselves, because the self-touch in a large brain.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. They sometimes interrupted this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showing flight behavior or stiffness. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of the tickle is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Large fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the Normandy Prefecture told AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to authorities, no hazardous substances have been released. The samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in operation with about 200 firefighting vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within a 500-metre radius were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The plant belongs to the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements. The plant employs about 400 people.
In the past, the chemical factory has already made headlines - for example, when in 2013 a leak escaped the gas methanthiol and the surrounding area smelled of lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 liters of mineral oil were poured into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament after the compulsory break was lifted on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU without a deal on October 31 if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Regarding Cox, who had campaigned for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to re-unify this country would be to carry out the EU withdrawal.” Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Iron Roses" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron replicas of roses. They are reminiscent of the roses that had been laid down in Oslo after thousands of weeks and people in the days before.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik set fire to a car bomb in the Oslo government district and then shot dead dozens of participants in a holiday camp on the island of Utöya, the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, killing a total of 77 people in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" trapped in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now sailing to Dubai, among other things for medical examinations, said Reedreichef Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship has left Iranian waters. "It's good that it's over," he told Swedish TV SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the statement said.
On July 19, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards re-established the tanker under the charge of disregarding the regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. They had been working professionally with the situation.
The British government suspected a response to a similar incident in British Gibraltar following the arrest of the "Stena Impero": there in early July a super-tank with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. The delivery violated the EU sanctions against the US, according to the authorities.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assumptions that it was an exchange deal to free the "Stena Imperio" rejected London vehemently.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait of Hormuz. Tensions in the region had become immensely exacerbated in recent months. The trade shipping has been in several conflicts between the United States and Iran. There have been several cases between the United States and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the most pressing nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans blamed the Iranian leadership for wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018 the United States alone had withdrawn from the international nuclear agreement, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, and at the same time, the U.S. with its political and economic goals to come to an end.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protectorates, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to produce a "war winner" in a global way. In the face of the punitive tariffs imposed by President of the United States Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers are forced to re-dispose. Finance managers of Asian companies who only consider re-distributing their production from China to another country such as India.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump’s focus. Devalued by Haudegen in the White House as the “Kingdom of Tariffs”, America stripped the emerging country of trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, other goods, mobile phones, spirit.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, only a side-show. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, Amsdra has a two-pronged, prime ministerial and India five-pronged threats against the United States.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a serious status in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic insanity, which in the multi-people state is now getting a high level of energy.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has been turned to the better in India in the first five years of Modi. But in trade policy this does not apply. This is motivated by the fact that internationally little competitive governments are trying to protect new nationally competitive suppliers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer's political stance, which makes his country economically radically renewed. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, the "India First" lawyers have gone to the global, but what the "India First" party has never done so far.
Funeral of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, citing the family Chiracs.
Aimed at competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Cup
The top of the world was already in the finish line when the two armies were still stündlich stündlich in the down-cooled Khalifa International Stadium, but still stündlich stündliche scenes were played at the end of the race. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He was able to keep himself well 300 meters from the finish line.
"I just wanted to help him. Anybody in this situation would have done the same thing for him," said Dabo after the race in the Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. Shyly he swung out first, didn't want to talk at all about his heroic act. After all, he just wanted to set up his personal best time and as he noticed
He did so that evening with insistence - and much more intense than he had thought. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially Dabo even gave his competitor Busby the lead in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who did not win the finish line-up with the end of the world.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already". However, only in training time, there is no counting.
Millions: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the wake of possible government-critical protests. In central Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in recent days, police had stepped up their street controls and partially searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to the protests, with hundreds of people arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, however, there was no protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura for the majority of the people of the country. The protests were held against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critics accused of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership had been held in Egypt for years, while the protests were held against Facebook for years.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) did not confirm the number of arrests.
Arbitrary Arrests
Many people had been "arrested arbitrarily", "just because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW said, citing lawyers detainees. The allegations against the detainees range, according to their lawyers, from "distribution of false information" to "misinformation" in cities, to "inquiries in other cities" and "in terrorist cases".
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: shipping retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from sales tax on donations of goods, the ministry explained on a question of the Greens-Bundestag faction, which the newspapers of the Funke-Medien-Gruppe reported on Friday, but the traders could set the market value of the unselling returns so low that they pay no or only little sales tax m
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that when ordering on the Internet, the federal citizens send back every sixth package. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the garbage. Donating them would cost the companies additional money, according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities estimate real estate donations as a turnover.
Green group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can assess non-sale products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should be able to rely on not to be penalized for donating from the model to the construction market.
Banksy Art at Auction: There Has Never Been a Better Time to Sell This Painting
Streetart Star Banksy’s “Devolved Parliament” will be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work "underlines the return of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic attitudes shaped by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is scheduled to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exposed the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Parliament".
The image could change the owner for a million.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday at the first meeting of the House of Commons after lifting a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court had delivered a hard blow exchange with the opposition, Johnson wants to carry out the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary, even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in south-east England, he painted a picture depicting a man smashing a star of the European flag with a scissor. The work is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament, according to his top adviser, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a “walk in the park”, Dominic Cummings said on Friday, we will be attending a book presentation.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of "betrayal" of the people, including accusations that he could put MPs at risk because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as a "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore calm would be if MPs finally respected the British's decision to leave the EU. It's not surprising that people were upset that Britain still hadn't left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the crowded mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church on Friday called for restraint. "We should speak to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
If not, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If this goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which surrounding the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each rule part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region's autonomy status, thus imposing restrictions on Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo called for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with harsh hand. It lets fire with sharp ammunition on the population, over 2000 detainees join in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already seated there. Protesting in Egypt has never been an unsafe time for everything. But since the adoption of the rule of law
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it goes against opponents. The situation has gone so far
Nowadays, every third person in Egypt is living on a large scale below the poverty line. Since 2016, the market has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, must decide who they finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only the product of the economy, but also of the economy.
BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months it was checked whether the complex system mesh works in conjunction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the tuw is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, this is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
The airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful audit, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real show stopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffer.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the Construction Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this fall at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of shortages of power cables have yet to be fixed, and the Tuv intends to review them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start-up of the flight operation, intensive work must continue to be done to deal with the shortcomings," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the cable lines on which the cable lines hang. The airport manager expects them to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the railway station under the terminal still does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke apron, which turn off in the event of a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced with new gas.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to be operational in 2011. The cost has increased from the beginning of construction in 2006 to about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 6.5 billion for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, the officials are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is scheduled to take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster will switch to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on hold.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs exploded - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he was chasing several vending machines into the air in the city area of Chemnitzer! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket vending machines exploded in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police detained a 33-year-old German man in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations for causing explosive explosions in Tate unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which were conducted by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his narcotics addiction with the loot." Only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber blew up parking ticket machines on the city street.
Total damage incurred amounts to at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000!
The automaton bomber is now under investigation and police investigations against him are ongoing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic blasts in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa’s subsidiary AUA will take over “the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna”, a spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday.
The German base of the Eurowings low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the seven Eurowings aircraft currently remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by the AUA in the "Wetlease" from January 2020, which includes Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed by Wittermaschine, which will be operated by Salzburg.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. The flight times will be adjusted for connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized traffic out of the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings only serves as a "Production Company" in Vienna, but only as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. Thus, among others, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines in the start, but the number of Eurowings will be lower than the number of pilots and flight.
At the airport of Vienna a price fight broke out after the Niki-pleite. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday to increase the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair aircraft together with crews to Vienna, also known as the "Kollegewerk".
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary's announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time, on Friday, AUA chairman Andreas Otto responded: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years' time."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli stopped Mozzi (34) at the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holidays earlier this month, the palace announced on Thursday.
“We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in a statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years, full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also posted immediately on her Instagram account.
A Royal Party
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More details on the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the wedding of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the legacy of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heredity of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to trace the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne-Stiftung is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. Switzerland includes the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essential influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was said at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Now the scientists want the complete inheritance of the heart of 1000 people.
More than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are currently known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, the clinic said.
The aim of the five-year project, according to the initiators, is to develop new options for preventing, detecting and treating heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the Herz- und Herzforschungszentrum.
The chairman of the Stiftung Kühne, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Stiftung in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now, at the medical campus there, he is to create a Center for Cardioci
The bio-samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. Inheritance encryption is strictly respected for the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a Moa Holgers University (Tertaby 1000) said.
According to UKE, a person’s genetic material can be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this are 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on October 1, 2020, all 9000 samples will be analyzed by the end of 2020. The next year, first results are expected.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to locals, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, in part minors, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told them. "The victims were mistreated by their.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the guards were detained by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were placed in a small room.
According to reports, the Koran school has existed for about ten years. Residents have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They were not aware of the suffering of their children.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, therefore, in the past ten months, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border into the neighboring state.
Nigerian police release 400 children from school after being chained and tortured
Police released nearly 400 students from horrific conditions at a school in northern Nigeria, "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
On Thursday, the children were discovered in an Islamic-style school, where conditions were "unhumane" and the officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were held at their school as slaves and put in chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed slimmed-down and injured students in a recognizably poor state of health.
World Cup: Messi and Klopp's accusations
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, many things in FIFA have proved to be disappointing: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. The FIFA World Cup election, however, has so far not entered into the national capitol member’s vote, but has been suspected of disappointing the national team.
But after the Nicaraguan captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible vote.
FIFA apologizes that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and therefore invalid" and has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudanese coach also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation indicates that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second place, and Sadio Mané in third place.
Accusations had also been raised by Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera: "I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you", he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football federation simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the association's administration announced: "I voted, but of course I didn't intend to. The completed electoral documents were "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, he also said in a statement of the association. But he actually voted for the second captain, Manuel Rosar.
The other cases are now being investigated by FIFA, but it stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer's election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, more will be determined by the facts."
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, "Trump watched Biden for years".
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, only a few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policies.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to its roots."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have formally not spoken out in the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. However, even the first senators of the Republicans have spoken out critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, said that the state of Utah, inter-extends itself in the second chamber.
The affair could lead to the initiation of a impeachment trial against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek a so-called impeachment. The decision on an actual impeachment fell but in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. As yet, no impeachment has been announced.
Were the torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, alleged to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested again in June, after she had illegally approached the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees aboard. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian rich people, she was little to the house of Federal President Alexander van der Bellen.
Now there are new serious allegations against rockets, but three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) Rubpreecher have not been able to "report" after migrants had their tormentors in Italy.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed in the partition, harassed and brutally executed.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports", said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that criminals will also be on the ships".
Italy's former right-wing interior minister Matteo Salvini has demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk aims for extradition record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter continued. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. To do this, Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over six percent. This is how strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, in the current and upcoming quarter, six-digit figures must be produced. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses last.
U.S. Budget Controversy: Just a Bridge Again
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate is in session at the House of Representatives on Thursday, and has decided on a transitional financing on November 21.
Shutdown averted
Preliminary, the federal administration will now be funded at the level of 1, and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which will allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. The spending laws, however, reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have hardly any chances in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly capable of a majority.
The ghosts are already divorcing mainly on the issue of allocation of resources for the field of internal security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans apparently try to force $ 12 billion for the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats have been interfering with the wall-building plans and on their projects it has been overturned in December and the military, the real one for the other.
On the wall, the ghosts are divorcing
It is currently unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November is not excluded either.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the accompanying danger of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process of popularity are gaining. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically reduce the funding of the federal administration back to the previous year's level.
France Allows Artificial Insemination for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro insemination, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French bishops' conference is also against the novelty.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women should be covered by social insurance.
Insemination with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
On the other hand, the National Assembly, by a narrow majority, rejected an amendment aimed at giving widows access to the semen of their dead husbands for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there were a number of cases in the past, particularly in which women have been spared.
Numerous members of the ruling La République en Marche (LREM) party of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed their support for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" even if her husband was still alive.
The initiators of the now unsuccessful amendment believe it is unfair that a widow may in future be able to be fertilised with the semen of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that hiring motherhood will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women – yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for Flight Taxes for Universities Become Louder
There is a lot of flying at universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax there in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
At the same time, the discussion on a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges has been postponed until the summer break. In a joint statement, the doctoral candidates of the University of Stuttgart and the University of Stuttgart called for support from the universities. After the State Rector's Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding initiative from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now received support from the universities.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time there was a shift of gunfire between the border guards and the crew of the boat. In doing so, three Russians and a North Korean have been injured, but the fisherman later suffered serious damage.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. According to the North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the Russian Coast Guard conducts patrols according to its own information to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered and seized on the boats, and the data were seized from three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Nahodka and Poshet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local businessmen. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been temporarily arrested there this year, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tightly mesh synthetic nets. With these, even small living beings would be fed from the sea, simply brought to 200 years. To
In the future, only 18,000: the US lowers the asylum ceiling
The “most generous nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shunning asylum seekers: As confirmed by the State Department in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low threshold for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be allowed into the country, as the U.S. Department of State explained. In the now almost expired financial year, 3 000 people will still be allowed into the country.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced admissions for asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years, with far higher admission limits under Barack Obama’s predecessor government.
The proposed ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, but the State Department described the United States as "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly adheres to the use of language by the incumbent U.S. president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild their home countries, Trump said. For his tough course in immigration policy, he receives a lot of praise from supporters, but there are also massive criticisms.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to dismantle. In order to be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear under pressure. Trump is currently undergoing a drossling due to the Amffärden and Selenskyj.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted because of their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have thus been put in danger, according to the statement of the Foreign Ministry.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this backdrop, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, an orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a reception station for human monkeys in the United States. The 1986 born in Rostock Zoo "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore her release was not compulsory for all Dallas, which is why her release was not required in the area.
Since the 53-kilogram-heavy human aphid is unable to adapt to wildlife in the US, it is expected to live in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson.
"Sandra" spent a few years after her birth in Rostock at the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process for "Sandra" fundamental rights has contributed to the development of the zoo of Buenos Aires.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Hussar ride on the nearly 3000 meters high Great Pine in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other means of assistance, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Clothed in jeans, t-shirt and supported only by absolute freedom of dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, thus undermining the old top brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of Europe’s six most important northern walls.
Nike Takes Advantage of New Online Marketing Strategy
U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased in the last quarter to 1.4 billion dollars (nearly 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period, as the company announced on-line " new strategy ", the reason for this is the direct market.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, with Nike’s sales figures increasing sharply by 22 percent in China, benefiting the Beaverton, Oregon, U.S.A., also in the People’s Republic of China, from its approach to direct communication via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments, expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the sporting goods manufacturer's shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus from AS Roma, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action with #wiNots.<0x40>officials.
The club responded late Thursday, reporting the fan's Instagram account and the police, and the Roma supporters were never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. On a regular basis, italian fans chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible people and throw them out of the stadiums."
However, there had also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now occupied 38 fans of record-breaking champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not expected to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of serious blackmail, money laundering and private violence, among others. The club launched the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders were behind the black trade with tickets, they had "military control" of the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus staff to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are thought out with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?

The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has great ecological water conditions, with a mixture of "30 per cent" and "30 per cent".
The people in Gaochun have already started more crab farming in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a distinctive industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been active in the agricultural industry around a well-established, ecological and scientific development.
In recent years, Gaochun has been advancing a reform to "distribute power, optimise administration and government services" and has carefully built the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending".

Iran-U.S. Conflict: Rouhani Speaks of Ending Sanctions - Trump Opposes
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly about an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, objected to his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had urged that a meeting be held. "And America says we will lift the sanctions," added San, adding that "the kind of punishment that will be imposed by the United States will be lifted."
However, the move was not done in an acceptable way, Rouhani criticized, and given the current penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron said that US President Donald Trump was speaking to the UN on the margins of the Trump administration.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After the western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay a day before.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region outside Istanbul and caused panic in the million-dollar metropolis. Now the government wants to deploy a commission to better prepare the country for future earthquakes.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built dwellings collapse - among other things, caused by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which have been registered in the center as places of refuge, have long been built. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings were not in Istanbul.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as reported by the Disaster Protection Authority Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the roads a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that no injuries or injuries were reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying, as was shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 that killed more than 17000 people. There
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need standing next to their doorsteps, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big earthquake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was following developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to which, two minarets of Avtari and Bezkenci collapsed in Moshe.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter that the buildings would be rebuilt. He called out to the people to rebuild. He urged the buildings
The time of the quake is said to be 13:59 (local time), and just minutes after the first quake, CNN Turkey said, there was a post-quake with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judges scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul, and its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million-dollar metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad said on Tuesday.
It wasn’t the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there may be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now, making it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later the great earthquake will come too."
Just a few weeks ago there had been an accident - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had shaken.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two brising documents provide new flammability in the President's case in Ukraine". Wwja is more concerned about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump.

USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - flyer redirected
A United Airlines flight was rerouted after a passenger was locked in the board toilet and the toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline said.
In an out-of-plane stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour after she was locked in, US media reported citing other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video circulating on the Internet, which is supposed to be from Flight 1554, according to US media, it is seen how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all the passengers. The woman apologized to the open.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation”, the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will never be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now at once the most powerful man in the United Kingdom is on his mission.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If the parliament is closed, so that the government can not be challenged in a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions almost beg the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself about " what he can do ".
Kafka's 1915 first-published narrative is about Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and sees himself "transforming into an enormous insect", is gradually excluded by family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that is lagging behind," said Dio.
EU invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.5 million in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will receive whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains, and sections of the train connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna’s Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
The aim is to make travel more comfortable and to reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including 31 October 2019, one day after his insolvency application, and travel "could not be undertaken for insolvency reasons", the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency check, it will continue to do so.
Thomas Cook in Germany was sucked into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money back to hotels from now on
As of Friday, however, hotels abroad that are currently hosting Thomas Cook vacationers will receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This is immediately applicable and provided that Thomas-Cook-travellers from these hotels will not be asked to pay individually from now on", said Engel.
The insurance company responded to reports of hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodations on the spot, some of whom had to put more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, on Friday will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still traveling. Zurich Germany has secured the holidays and return of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payments to hotels announced by Zurich Insurance will only help travelers who are currently traveling. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to go on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips including 31 October would be canceled. This also applies to such bookings.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be checked, it said. In principle, for these cases, the insurance Zurich is also responsible. The sale of new travel has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, who can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers can find out on the Kaera website about ways of reimbursing the travel price and make their claims through a web form.
Prince Harry demolishes mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued the commitment of Lady Diana. Now in Africa, he is walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Clothed in a blue splitter protection vest, British Prince Harry has set fire to a mine in Angola and destroyed it.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone still has more than 100,000 relics of the land of the past decade, it still has more than 100,000 relics of the land of the past decade.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosives master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she was going at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana had in 1997 also went through a demolish minefield.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a 10-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations stalling: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear again: With him, Johnson's departure from the Brexit negotiations would not be guaranteed a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by the polarising British has been forever. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK has been swept up like a damocles sword over the blonde.
Boris Johnson believes deal is possible
Johnson, meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, hinted that in the event of a disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that it works.
And the time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels, however, notwithstanding the Brexit's position. Still about six weeks ago, the EU and the UK brokers could have time to prevent the UK's exit from the European Union without a deal. However, even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough again.
U.S.: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the U.S. health authority CDC reported. A study in the "New England User Journal of Medicine" has confirmed that there are still more than 900 cases of these cases.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain is calling for a "people's revolution". For Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics of the country are invoking corruption and mistreatment.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and divided the phones with photos of pedestrians.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were false calls in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not taken place in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), "for the past week, only nearly 2000 people wanted to arrest them."
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he overthrew democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists and pro-government activists have been detained for years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition and was greeted on his arrival at the Hamburg harbour, among others, by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the "Malizia" race hunt.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had in recent months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland investigated and documented the consequences of global warming.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to come to terms. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, was measured with a drone Greenland glacier ice and was made with nets according to microplastics.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas" the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us, who have the survival of the oceans at heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which provoked heated reactions.
"These cases are damaging the reputation of Rome, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday issue).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this is not to be deduced from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, said the host.
After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, U.S. President Donald Trump may actually be facing an impeachment process, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj wants to be active in 2020. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has been talking about the Ukrainian national security and about the democracy of the United States with his complaint finally brought to the public, is monstrous: the President has misappropriated the power of the other country for the flu.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, now published, although it does not reproduce the full text, but the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, the center of which, besides Trump, is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes out from the viewpoint of the public in May 2019, however, its beginning may be very rich, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not mix in a choice, we want to mix in a
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump’s counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, in order to construct an occasion for the Russian investigations in the United States was never serious.
In this regard, it is precisely the investigations about which Trump's subordinate was going to speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the president is: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential nomination of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has been appointed as the general representative of the Obama administration.
In fact, the course was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by this. In addition, Schokin was even accused of a deeply corrupt gesture, the US government was the only one to be released from the US.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded again and again since about 3.30 pm. Also Instagram issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if it does not affect itself.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
It is not the first massive disruption this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also this time mainly resort to Twitter to blow their trouble.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter took to rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we got the message, at just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were above the hose boat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should still not be used.
Since several new smartphones have just come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick is extremely damaging to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a phone normally by cable, the battery warms up within three hours to 27 degrees. When charging wirelessly the smartphone itself has 30 degrees.
Capacity and lifespan
According to the researchers, the temperature for the shelf life of batteries is still a decisive factor, although the battery is free of charge. Since every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces capacity, but it also does not last for so long. The life span of a smart phone is therefore less. The researchers recommend using a cable to charge a smartphone.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without an annoying cable salad and tedious plug smoke. Because with Qi (it is possible to use the inductive energy transmission only in the world.
Everest Staus Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer reportedly climbed 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just six months, with Nirmal Purja (36) reaching the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of mountaineers standing on Mount Everest snake in the spring.
The image of the mass attack sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and the highest peak of the earth, with eleven climbers dead in the climb within a few days in May.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th Eighteenth millennium: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wants to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four corpses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka, and their deaths are theoretically punishable by the death penalty.
British oil tanker detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its detention by Iran. This was announced by the naval office of Bandar Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the tanker flying under the British flag on July 19, under the accusation of Gulf law.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. In this case, it should be about the salaries of the board of directors as well as the question why the British government did not like to financially help the company struggling for survival.
Experts Say Genes Are Overestimated at Risk of Intestinal Cancer
The role of genes in the family increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to a current study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits therefore weigh the individual risk probably more than previously assumed.
Elon Musk to raise Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of business with a plus of over six percent. This is how strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, in the current and upcoming quarter, six-digit figures must be produced. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does the UK government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson withholds
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and on a similar question he just told reporters on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, Johnson criticizing this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the law's entry into force to the time after its exit from the EU.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Iran is apparently driving up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has raised pressure on the European treaty partners in the 2015 dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the pledge to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States stepped out of the agreement on its own in order to bring Iran back to a change of course with "maximum pressure" to come from the Trump-considered Middle East government.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September, and that Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges, according to the IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to bear their share of the deal, so they left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rohani said, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on a major oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the common position changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, however, the U.S.-backed Houthi rebels did not have the same value.
"Those who make such accusations must present evidence to President Boris," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders would not have been able to do this during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have only invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this on the day Emerkull, and Rouhani had been in contact with Prime Minister Emerkull.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration must first be lifted, Rouhani called on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet crosses the solar system from another star
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was previously only done once. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was initially only an assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-flung comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it is not our system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get close-up insights into a foreign solar system from the orbit of David's orbitals before it ever disappears. Early observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands, the 15th century.
According to the analyses, the comet was traveling on a so-called hyperbolic system, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called, so-called.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in the approach, leaving many months for the researchers to investigate. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be bigger with Tele until October 2020.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already conducted the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in an initial examination the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Images of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii clearly show a
Researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar equinox, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles that of comets of our solar system, and that indicates that in IUCA, our composition must be similar to that of comets.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new path to the exploration of certain processes in other solar systems. However, the frequency of such dot visits is still difficult to estimate. One of the next European interstellar visitors could catch off the planned satellite.
The agency intends to deploy the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (comet interceptor) at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth by 2028. According to ESA science director Günther Hasinger, it is planned to either visit an unaffected or fresh interstellar comet system.
First landing at Beijing’s new mega-airport Daxing
On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, the first passenger car of China United Airlines landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s most recent prestigious project is also called “Sea Sisters” due to its six-arm structure.
The complex has four runways to be expanded to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and considerably smaller, has been postponed until now. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years, a first passenger car landed.
New supersonic plane expected to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency UK Space Agency is already dreaming. The aim is to make possible this, aimed at the flight in the 2030s at the supersonic pace a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire "could develop", said the US-Sender Agents.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency also wants to cooperate more closely with the Australian Air Force in the development of the US spacecraft. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As so far the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003 the flight from New York to Paris was cancelled.
"Sabre will make the world smaller again with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound device. In addition, such aircraft can also be driven more generously than the other.
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous whistleblowers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power of the US president, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaked positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told U.S. envoys to the United Nations in New York on Thursday, saying the person was almost "a spy" and had been treated "a little bit differently" in the past than today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media disseminated audio clips of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outraged to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their allegations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who has raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. president is “using the power of his office” to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about the past affairs of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine.
The whistleblower accused the White House in particular of publishing a system with a view to the Ukraine phone call also the cover-up: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the blanket. As usual, an electronic wording of a protocol was made out of the Wessauer, but this was made out of the Wessauer data.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump questioned the source's credibility again on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" spread second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no tip-offs or spies at all.
As Trump commented in New York on those who allegedly gave information to the whistleblower, however, it sparked outrage: U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and his environment in various committees for months now, and in the face of Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pursuing investigations with new strength in order to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman regularly. Trump had already criticized
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy spheres, working mostly under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, in a statement released on Friday, backed the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible impeachment process.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual dismissal falls in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no impeachment has been achieved.
VW Operations Council: Jobs are being "sleeping down"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the automaker’s operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of this, 500 million euros are expected to be part of this year.
A key to this is the personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the Board of Directors in 2016 already envisages the reduction of 14,000 jobs by 2020 in Germany alone. In principle, a job can only be removed from the car manufacturer if it is proved that the activities associated with it are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper has now learned from business council circles, however, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are being "sleeped" down another path - that is, past the official course, so that regular vacancies would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the operating council does not have the opportunity to enforce the re-occupation. In the meantime, there is a lack of staff in many places, the work density is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleed of the vehicle works would be greater. This also increases the fear that the vehicle production can gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe to other countries.
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and to control new projects centrally. This also reduces costs and also speeds up decisions - this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a managers conference in Berlin: "We are doing well in uncertain times between the United States and Brexit".
For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time it is not called VW, according to our information
Twenty hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg main plant is the only VW factory in which the vehicles are produced. The plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg VW-intern the rule of thumb applies that there must be built annually 800,000 cars to ensure that the plant is satisfactorily profitable at this time.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll out of the band in Wolfsburg "perspectively", which is intended to make it possible to bundle the golf production in the parent plant - because the Zwickau plant is leaving the golf production site through the conversion to the site for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently evolved decreasing. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build up the e-mobility, it should remain for the time being the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human trafficker convicted
Young Nigerian women have been sworn in, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have been sentenced to prison.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to up to eight years and three months of probation and imprisonment. The defendants had taken young Nigerian women to the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience to a citizen, the expatriates of the Nigerians still had to be punished.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought in hose boats over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to cope with the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The salary was therefore completely deducted from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on board in the process. "The work made it difficult for women to create physically and mentally," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the announcement of the verdict. "Some were rightly upset."
The verdicts are on the inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, bribery and forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa group, the flight attendants union Ufo has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on October 14 about the labor struggle measures in the LH Group", said UFO tariff board Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have refused for months to negotiate with the UFO tariffs.
In this point, after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now looks strengthened. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering to appeal against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently", I think it was true.
In August, Lufthansa had also filed a request with the Federal Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a trade union checked by the court, arguing that the trade union had not set up a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfill its role as a tariff partner.
A fierce leadership dispute in the trade union had preceded, in the course of which numerous members of the board of directors as well as the advisory board resigned, including longtime trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had already begun a preliminary vote on strikes of cabin staff at Eurowings due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but this should change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa requirements.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the aim is to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism commission said.
“Saudi Arabia’s opening up to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists so far. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state granted. With the new rules, the ErzkonservativeKönigreich expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, it wants to reduce its dependence on tourism.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik as well as the oil field of Churais.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for their wedding.
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos on which she can be seen in the white wedding look.

The Biebers said yes a year ago in a New York office, and there had not been a bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. The search also involved a military helicopter. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European Tree Species Are Endangered
In addition to pests, diseases, extraneous species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the World Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all known 454 tree species in Europe. 265 of them are already found on any other continent.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "amended by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Eberesque and wild horse chestnut threatened
One of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, said: "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks less bad for the wild Ordinary Ross chestnuts. They are considered as "endangered" since 2017 cities, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan mining moth besides a mushroom. It has been spreading since the 1980s from southeastern Europe to the whole continent.
Straw species and mosses are also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one-fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wildlife, a key role in aggression and other species of tigers.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake near Istanbul: 34 injured reported
Dozens of people were forced to leave their homes and 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, according to reports.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged, with nearly 200 aftershocks since the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on Thursday shaking the Marmara region outside Istanbul and triggering panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
The government now wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disruption, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
As early as Tuesday, a 4.6-magnitude quake had shaken the region around Istanbul, calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the halftime show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't get bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is madly excited to be in the Super Bowl in February 2020.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of appearing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina". She could hardly wait "to show the world what we do to the girl".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she feels honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and around the world. "And then also together on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, "it's the first time" that Bühne
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV shows in the United States. Even if you have recently dropped the number of spectators: This February, the show in the United States attracted the fewest spectators in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly 100 million people in the city.
In February, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform in the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the show in the half-time - the critics were unwilling.
Kaepernick, then the best quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, did not want to be politicized anymore in the 2016/17 season before the NFL games at the national anthem from protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, the US president Donald Trump attacked him
Cook's Gate: Hotels Get Money from Insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press release. There are high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would have to make a total depreciation of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase write-offs of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and the lenders would have to buy <0xC2><0xA3>550 million to <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, with the actual amounts to be written-offs likely to be at the top end of the bandwidths, one expert told the newspaper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will show up after the end of the insolvency proceedings. One person close to this procedure did not sprinkle too much hope. For example, the about 40 planes of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad conditions, Co-mark can continue to buy it out with the money where the Thomas-Slot could be.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have secure information about it ourselves," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, to the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they were on their ships without.
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, crashing a ship of the Italian financial police. The three suspects were reported to have arrived there that day. Investigations are underway against the captain for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from security authorities.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief continues, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the federal government has agreed to require suppliers to provide a “declaration of trustworthiness”.
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology consists not only of the hardware:
It’s the software that’s important to keep the devices up to date, which consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
It’s “very difficult to imagine” that a government agency, “no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief said.
He accuses Chinese Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. is presented with findings that place government officials within the company, and Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the U.S. position.
Chemiefabrik in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened with precaution on Friday, the competent prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had urged citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to be exposed to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called to feed their animals and to feed the animals inside.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk of odor spreading after the extinguishing, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the fire site, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were in use.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs, according to authorities, to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso, near Milan, Italy.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seines could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at around 02:40, the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest, and the sooner the better," Le Maire said at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
Those states that have budgetary leeway for more investment should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these playgrounds, the minister added, referring to the high government debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French government debt must be "stabilized" and "lowered", Le Maire said.
In recent years, Germany has repeatedly been called on to make more public investment in order to revive the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly called on France to address its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax reliefs of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the Yellow Vest protests, with the re-indebtedness expected to drop to 2.2 percent this year, according to 3.1 percent.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson has sharply criticized the “capitulation law” passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requiring the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson may still use a loophole. Addressed this possibility, however, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the latest law passed by parliament, which is exactly what is meant to prevent. On a similar question, Johnson just told reporters that his government will abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU until mid-October, Johnson criticizing this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed on Thursday the assumption that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he is striving to enter into a treaty with the EU on 31 October and will be able to move forward with the European Union.
Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, said he felt the political strife over Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the EU’s intended exit would still happen: “We’ll enjoy it, we’ll win, we’ll leave (Note: an editorial: “At the end of the EU,” Cummings said, “no worries.”
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now acting as the chief strategist at the UK government headquarters Downing Street, purporting to be behind the uncompromising policy that has put the prime minister in an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Front.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Arizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made her, some hundreds of them are now being published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, there is always one in the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he had always danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phoned in his bathing suit with a bag on his head or wore unshaven moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on her farm in the south of England or Scotland that McCartney also led a very normal life, so the McCartney told the BBC.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaroid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo". And Linda would have had the gift to say, "It's always the right moment to catch it."
The light, the composition, the image section and the colors match, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all the anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes are also just like abstract paintings before the 50 years ".
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey would not be able to stop imports of oil and gas from Iran, despite the U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies have withdrawn “due to U.S. threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, according to the US, which secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months tensions in the Gulf region have escalated considerably.
U.S. government wants to limit admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the intake of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is a cut of 40 percent.
The U.S. Department of State said the U.S. would continue to support refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the inclusion of two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted because of their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have thus been put in danger, according to the statement of the Department of State.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, number 85,000 was low.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, adding that the U.S. would further damage its leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legally and illegally. According to his own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Get Close to a Spice"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblower whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever has given the whistleblower who accuses him of abuse of power "is coming close to a speck," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about the controversial incidents in the White House, Trump replied: "This is close to a speck." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did differently than we did in the old days?
Observers rated the latter remark as a possible allegation of the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation by witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional inquiry into a possible impeachment trial against him.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a complaint now published of having abused his office in order to ask for an interference of another country in the U.S. 2020 election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informant are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat identified: baby and toddler drown in the Aegean Sea
Over and over again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The boats are often too small. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of a hose boat - including five children.
Seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a hose boat off the Greek island of Chios, including a baby and four other children, the Greek coastguard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Breaking Up Concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has found a rough end due to an impassioned lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it's left".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologised and added that Daltrey "really can't talk now". The audience promised Townsend to come at his expense at a compensation concert. But an appointment is not yet set.
The Who, scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, have cancelled performances and are expected to be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office rental company.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners need to fear billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office lease owner WeWork has been threatening to disrupt the balance of New York's largest real estate markets in the world. The company had recently dismissed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned stock exchange and with the sale of subsidiaries and securities such as the private jet has begun to come under the leadership of others.
WeWork is supposed to rent large office spaces long term to this business, and rent them short term in part small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money at this business at a breathtaking speed. In the past year, Millar5 has been renting a company at a rate of 1, Millar5, Millar5, Millar5.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented out several locations in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, to almost 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than that of new ones in New York.
Also in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have transformed their properties for the requirements of WeWork only by pursuing high investments. If WeWork were to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of revenues. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork, so long as they do not have the special reserves of AntzWork.
Russia seizes North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coast guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 more wild boars arrested in recent days who had fished illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters in 2018. 8.The Russian Coast Guard conducts patrols according to its own data on the protection of its marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were detected. In addition, according to the data, three fishermen- and two motorboats were deployed to Wwo.
According to media reports, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been temporarily detained there in 2019, and the Russian fishing authority has not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with strictly mesh synthetic nets. With these, even small creatures from the sea would be easily brought to 200 years.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests last week. According to the FSB, a North Korean also wounded died later in his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first caught a North Korean boat and then opened the second.
U.S. imposes entry ban on former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department justified this in a statement Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he faces a system in which more than 100 Cubans would be arrested and thousands would be detained.
As the head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Venezuelan Maduro regime," said Mike.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued entry bans, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle has raged for months between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government in order to force him to kneel at the head of the Venezuelan government and the opposition leader Juanid himself.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of deployed doctors. According to the US and Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Fridays for Future climate protests
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are once again on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning again actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to make the start due to the time shift before the protests over Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg also wanted to attend a major event in Montreal.
How great the worldwide appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week, is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far it has been in the framework of the strike week 6383 actions, it has been in 170 countries.
In particular, in Germany, the influx of people was very large last Friday. A good third of all the world's protesters in the West and in the West - around 1.4 million - wanted to participate in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, the demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, but also in Köln and Berlin.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had stood before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests are mainly attended by students and students, but also by other scientists.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the imminent climate catastrophe, in particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming needs to be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic session of alternative protection with a high-sea racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and UN summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the heads of state and government of the Earth.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass agency. The ban is expected to enter into force on October 1.
Anyone who smokes, however, must expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Grilling meat on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Attack on Cybercriminals - Investigators Raise Servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time erected a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle via which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
The Attorney General’s Office in Koblenz announced that seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The suspects' customers were allegedly the operators of the world's second-largest darknet drug market, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecommunications routers at the end of November 2016, according to the prosecutor general via a server in Cyberbunker.
Such a host was first set up in Germany, it said. A webhoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are on the streets again today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backmen?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror to the people of power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it a manipulative? Is it a climate activist market itself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people on a journey similar to that made by Sears to raise themselves for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man can create an aggregation of children and youth for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne has made himself feel like a young man.
But there is also a shadow side in this regard. Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers by her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself far and wide, thanks to the unfamiliarity of the journey.
Here the spirits are now divorcing: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together during the world rescue action with stockbrokers? No matter what position is ultimately involved in doing so, a critical and reflected viewpoint can also make it more important than a democratic one.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Visitor Crosses Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently busy astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov on the Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-made telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system view. He was only the second of his kind in flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get close-up insights into an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), clearly interstellar, and moves it from an interstellar orbit to a current system.
Comet has already been seen before approach - and can be observed for several months
However, before it is so far, astronomers can still observe it in-depth. Because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from the ground for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December, then by April 2020 it will be teleported to the USDa" explained by David.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov arouse hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation of León could suggest that our comets are similar to those in other solar systems.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered in just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid passed by the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified about brother
Around Boris Johnson it gets lonelier. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister whispers with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to upgrade - at least verbally. During the questioning hour in the lower house on Wednesday, this met with massive indignation of the opposition, and now more critics have come to terms: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal should be "hanged, dragged, quartered, fed and feathered". She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version of the "Pari-Ch's" anti-Belgium vote, said Rachel Johnsons to the EU.
In particular, she found out that her brother, Jo Cox, was now speaking out very openly about LaTree's decision to come to the House of Commons, a member of the EU-friendly House of Representatives, who had been murdered by a Neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum.
Cox's widow also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos' name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if you passionately and resolutely agree to what you believe - no matter what the view you are. But never let's be more inclined to "attempt to demonize the other side".
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had resigned his post as secretary of state and his term as Tory MP. “I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months – it’s an insoluble tension,” Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also faced sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they stated: "In the past days, the language should be respected, both in debates with and outside of Parliament.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is setting a strong mark: in the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots will perform, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl Latina Power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the US NFL Football League, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2nd in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida live many people with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the November in the drama "Hustler".
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US each time. This year, many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event in the U.S. and at the same time a gigantic publicity show. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused furor there. Usually, in the NFL final, Germany watch well over 100 million.
Last year there was a lot of political controversy in advance of the group. The reason was the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up in protest against police violence against blacks, and for that, among other things, by US President Donald Trump had been harshly approached on the subject.
An actor and youtuber hires Egypt’s ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men, who had influenced whether the streets of Egypt were flooded with blood again, said the president of the United States, said that they had spent the past week both abroad. One of the two flew back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly, said the ex-general, who in 2013 freed the Muslim Brotherhood.
To lead astray - this is trying to confuse the president of the other man's homeland, who currently determines what happens on the streets. Mohamed Ali of course stayed abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces, which would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter the Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old Youssef was the only one who played in the cafe.
He expresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president swells in luxury and lets them build magnificent new palaces, it says there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he knows in his second profession as a construction contractor, he speaks exactly how to
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip on the security of the Poles, he had detained thousands of protesters against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile delta, where protesters were supposed to break up a banner with the portrait of the president in pieces last week, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo, several subway stations were blocked in the city centre due to "revolutionary maintenance"
Mohamed Ali urged these measures to change his tactics: "Our target must not be Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not clash with police officers." But as a retreatant, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much power
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transmission rates are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavaria Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the test of the providers is carried out according to specific specifications of the provider and is therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the consumer center of Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of 14 days to complete the promised performance, which is best done by written notice of objection.
If this does not work, even after several requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the legal action will help.
First-high-ranking Republican to be investigated
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here, is determined by the facts that can be established before," said Phil Scott, the governor of Vermont, in an impeachment inquiry into US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads from here is determined by the facts that can be established before the facts can be determined," said Scott at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
So far, Republicans have refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policies on several occasions, such as easing anti-default and anti-environmental smears.
Spider-Man Remains in MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to proceed with the movies around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is reported by several U.S. media accordingly. According to the film launch should be established: In the U.S. the film will start from July 16, 2021.
In the "Screenrant" magazine, Marvel Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I am delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. Me and everyone at the Marvel Studios are thrilled that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes.
But what about the sudden good news? Sony reportedly made an offer to Marvel. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would contribute 30 percent to the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finals
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the big finale. In the last episode there were many happy ends and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who for many years followed in the series, was included in the charming cut to the series.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful marriage with his hailed Mike or how she hailed him.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was not really mentioned in the "Suits" finale by the Prince of England, but by coincidence, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is going straight to the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gaulder, 51) is going to make a big deal.
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned while sailing a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. Seven people died in the accident, the Greek coastguard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousse, between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland, saving four children, three women and five men.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wants to "inform Turkey about how the refugee situation is", said Seehofer on Friday, after which he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help with the management.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission on Friday confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece continues to receive an unusual number of migrants from Turkey, with 654 people moving to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek civil protection ministry said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The rise in the number of refugees in Greece has recently raised doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted a Syrian refugee for every exiled Syrian.
However, the handling of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side because of the lack of personnel. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, have almost 29,400 people. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
There have never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, people's climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart-circuiting system has led to high temperatures in the heart and large temperature jumps in the heart.
Green politician to hold herself accountable for embarrassing photo panic
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Greens chief holds a disposable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been quite a long time unnoticed in the post office - and in the end it can still be noticed. The reusable cup of coffee with metal straw was never held in the hand by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the website of the party she was already seen on a photo with this cup, and in the conversation with the media was already published - the all-in-one
Greens chief has to hold herself accountable for photo panning
The National Post then accused May of manipulating and that the party produce fake news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she did not know anything about this action. To underscore this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, the, she correctly stated, it was made of bamboo. She always brought him with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that under the logo, it was just going to the site
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, and at the same time asked some of her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face, so I'm more concerned?"
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer Wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime Flight Ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly upgraded by email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, more than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the departure, Jaqueline’s employees refused an upgrade, even though she had presented an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly intended an upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline again tried to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman should have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they checked at the head office. And in fact, the employee, from whom the mail allegedly came in contact with DasqueMail, should have also checked the system.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban on Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (around 1,280 euros), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because while Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains locked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to settle for it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil Prices Reveal Report on Armistice in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon in the shortest possible time. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea resort Brent cost $ 61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) variety fell by 1.3 percent to $ 55.77.
The trigger for the price slide was a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in mid-September killed five percent of the world’s oil production. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the Yemen civil war had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, would hold Iran accountable. One would hold Iran accountable.
Should an agreement actually come into effect, one could focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Commodity Strategy department at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are continuing their downward movement over the past few days, with a barrel of WTI oil costing almost $59 a week and Brent almost $65 a week ago.
Recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that after the attack in mid-September, repairs to oil plants in Saudi Arabia were progressing faster than expected, with production reaching a volume of eight million barrels per day and moving back towards the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting rapid progress of state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to go public and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after being detained by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepare the departure of a ship in R<0xC3><0xA5>d, while the ship continued to share with H<0xC3><0xA5>kker An
However, the U.S. announced that it would move Iranian missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain had significantly increased oil prices over the past few weeks.
Allegations against Trump escalate
In the case of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, the accusations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have made an intense effort, after a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj, explained that "in late July, an access to the wording of the statement was prevented."
North Korea calls into question the third summit of Trump and Kim
North Korea has raised doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of the ruling Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and the prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore.
The US had so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean foreign ministry. He also criticized toughened US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea, but he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision to make it more likely to come to a decision.
Trump had said on Monday that he would like to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he prepares for it. Negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been underway since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim. Then the two met in Hanoi in February, they both fell into strife. Jun
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help clear mines
With the help of a blue splitter vest, however, the British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically detonated and destroyed a mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With a view to the goal of "coming to Angola by 2025 mine-free"
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British Pound under pressure
In the face of a swift interest rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculation on an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) adds to the pound sterling, the British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to $1.2269.
The sales were triggered by statements by banker Michael Saunders. This led to an interest rate cut, even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, said Mr. Saunders.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the strains on the economy caused by the Brexit hack, without directly signaling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move his country out of the EU even if there is an emergency without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt-Editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Revealed
Material from the Moscow analysis lab is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and today head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Athletics Championships, new details about the doping scandal in Russia emerge - and they destroy the few in credibility that the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even only initially. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015.
In December 2014, a systematic sporting fraud was revealed in the Russian sport8. After that, the Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee was neutral at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016. After an individual test, they were neutral at the World Cup in Rio 2016.
Positive findings are lacking
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but called for access to the lab and the said samples. The data should provide information about the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) said in a statement that they have received the data from the World Athletics Association (IAAF) and that they have now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the free-ranking force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the Interview.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization holding on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, now Russia threatens the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
