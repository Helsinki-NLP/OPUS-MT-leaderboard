Newcomer helped Trabzonspor to second place, <0xC5><0xA0>koda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped with the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 at Kayserispor and held Besiktas in third place.
Attacker Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after his January move from Slavia, which was saved, even though he fell 1:3 on the Fenerbahce field.
The rookie confirmed on the defender excellent productivity with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from an angle hit the ball into the net.
The homers managed to tie up five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the win on his side in the sixth minute of the setup when he successfully finished the break of four to one.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda in the start of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo at 1:1.
Although Rizespor did not hold the indecisive condition for a long time, it was not necessary to hate him, because thanks to the results of the opponents, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition ends the Sunday duel of the master Basaksehir at the Kasimpasy field.
The well-concealed cave of a deserter in the forests of Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ické hory, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, in the forests that led the Hrab<0xC4><0x9B>cí road, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and Artificially Created.
And we're going to go after the human hand that made it.
The place is called the Cave of the Desert.
In fact, however, no deserter ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber apparently on the grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rocky ravine and accessible by stairs upstairs.
But at the last moment it is practically impossible to see.
It is revealed only by a narrow staircase leading to a rock gallery, from where it just enters the rock.
Although it appears that the chamber is far from human habitation, at the time of its formation it could have been on a plateau where there is now a forest, a field.
"The fact that the object does not have a window and even in the traditional location of the melting pot, clearly shows that no deserter could survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek from the Faculty of Philosophy Jan Evangelisty Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem.
The single-room object has only a stone bench at the back, which appears to be used to store the containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
On the walls of the cave there are visible traces of instruments.
Breaking the sandstone with a spike was quite simple and fast for the dedicated.
It was enough to properly use the joints and gradually break the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail along the tip and the method of cutting at all, the period of formation of the cave can be determined by the frame.
According to historians, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, there is sometimes someone sleeping there these days.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are attracted by the flowing stream under the cave and the nearby county road, then you will surely find a path down there as well.
And on your way out of the forest, you may still be seized by the nearby Harrow Rocks.
Jockey Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík is in an artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best hands now.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly facilitates my situation and also the care of Finja’s daughter,” said Katja, Mina<0xC5><0x99>íkov’s wife, in a statement on Jezdci.cz.
"Everyone is doing their best, Philip needs time to recover.
It makes no sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of trauma to the head and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
Now we all have to be patient and give him time," said the 45-year-old jockey's wife.
Mina<0xC5><0x99>ík's financial support was also challenged on Twitter by star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh round of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, matching the legend Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been collected on the Gofundme server.
The target is 100,000 euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee takes four goals from Sassuolo players, losing 0:2
The Sassuola footballers got four balls in the opponent's goal on Saturday in Naples, but eventually they had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consulting with the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record reluctance of the technology, so many interventions the VAR has never squandered on one team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no other team.
New technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"The Festival of Unrecognized Goals of Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so strict on one team,” added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
However, Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s goal was not recognized after the video referee's intervention due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>’s intervention and Francesco Caput’s and Domenico Berardi’s hits did not apply.
On the other hand, the home team added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, it was the most reloaded in history
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registration of new e-autos," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Chmelík, Head of Clean Technologies Department of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car maker, as well as supermarkets Bill and Lidl, are also reporting their share on the market.
The operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We did not start building our network for electromobility until last year," company spokeswoman Jana Jusková explained.
However, the editorial board of Diník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
It turns out that the drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we pass small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average of two and a half hours to charge.
The vast majority of refueling then took place at a free rate.
If the motorists had already paid for the pickup, their typical expenditure was around 330 crowns.
Electricity is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five most used chargers of the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which with its popularity overshadows the entire regional cities.
Between the regions leads Olomouc.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border, for example in Bohumína or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In a large-scale survey of the Czech Moving Journal, eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Green activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far on the protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more radical approach.
The last drop event was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who are long-term opposed to the expansion of the Turów mine, there are people here who are opposed to the mining of gravel at the Hungarian Strait, there are people here who are opposed to the construction of nonsensical dams," Marika Wolfová told the organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters are to create a plan for water retention in the countryside, a dramatic change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not the ruthless and devastating business," she said.
At Malostranské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí, a stall was placed with a petition calling on Czech state representatives to plant on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of the rapeseed dungeon" or "Less coal, more boats".
From southern Moravia, Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda from the association For water for people came to Prague, protesting against the plan to extract gravel in Hodoninska.
“It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people,” he said.
He added that drilling is the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned mining of the gravel pit is located only about 500 meters from the wells and it is estimated that the quality of the water will be threatened.
For the so-called agroecological farmers came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovy Vary Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD>.
He pointed out the pros of small farms that do not marry for income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, not causing such a devastation in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people killed in plane crash at home in Germany
Three people were killed and two injured in the crash of an ultra-light aircraft into an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local rescue teams said two crew members and one resident of the house were among the dead, according to the report.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Local firefighter Robert Meyboom said both members of the plane's crew had died.
According to police, the third victim was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), referring to Mayor Wesel, wrote that it was the mother of a self-employed woman whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on the landing.
Police say it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, referring to eyewitnesses, said the plane had crashed into a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane collapsed in the air before hitting the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech savings bank incorrectly billed some card payments twice.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, the <0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna mistakenly charged some card payments to its clients twice.
According to bank spokesman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were recorded by the savings company on Saturday afternoon.
“Yesterday (Saturday night) we did a system update and all these double payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At this point everything is working smoothly," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the bank’s spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, there were fewer than a thousand transactions.
Find out the causes of the problems of the savings bank.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," said Kropík.
<0xC4><0x8C>eská spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic in terms of number of clients.
At the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch will present the system of three emergency stages against the coronavirus on Monday
"They will gradually be according to the strength of community expansion at the level of the regions.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said in <0xC4><0x8C>T.
These are so-called traffic lights, each region will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that he will still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian region would have an orange color and Prague would approach it.
The map will also include individual measures for district hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
Aquarius and Karolinka
When the waterman Jonas and the miller’s daughter Karolinka look at each other, it’s not easy at all.
Jonah is in love with his father, the ruthless waterman Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonah is not a man.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor who will do anything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolinka, from the sergeant's villain.

Soon, everyone in the village is clear who is responsible for drowning the evening Kettle, spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other lottery.
Angry villagers will arrange a hunt for a waterman, and an irreconcilable waterman's curse will also fall on Jonah's head.
And now, Karolinska's sweetheart!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of <0xC4><0x8C>T and in the exteriors at the Brzin pond, in Obd<0xC4><0x9B>nicy in Sedl<0xC4><0x8D>ansk and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of the infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading with the Czech Republic, or the summer sunshine dose has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious departments of hospitals are half empty, although the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," says Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore scarves, the army carried out pickups, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfectant for a year in advance.
However, ten people died every day.
Now, the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but a maximum of two people die each day with Covid-19.
The highest number of people infected is still in Karvinsko, similar numbers are already in Jihlava due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly closed hygiene in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice on Královéhradecka.
The disease was confirmed by tests from one of the nurses.
"We are moving, we have restricted movement, we have all hygienic measures," says the director of the retirement home Martin Schán<0xC4><0x9B>l.
According to him, none of the clients at home has symptoms of the disease yet.
Surface testing will start hygiene tomorrow and then decide on the next measure.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of people infected.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a cloak on the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of the coronavirus - most of them made up of foreign employees of the prachta company.
In total, there were 131 more infected on Saturday - half the number on Friday - but less tests are being carried out on the weekend.
A champion debutant!
Van den Bergh finished the story, Anderson smetl
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh showed excellent performance even in the fight with the player who won the second most prestigious company in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was mutually balanced, the breaking came at 8:7 for the Belgian dartboarder.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-legged leg and has been at the top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and the much more experienced "Flying Scot" was hardly getting to doubles.
The way in which the "Dreammaker" had him in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th league.
In addition, the young Belgian handled very high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the eleventh league, but in a bad state "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game there was a huge frustration on Anderson.
Rather, he threw down the arrows, and his triumphant opponent acted sovereignly.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The winning trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian dart player because it is his first major win.
It is still true that the last player who managed to defeat van den Bergh is Karel Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, a man confessed to the fire of the cathedral.
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organs.
Investigators investigated the suspicions of the fire because the fire had spread through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no sign of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The defendant is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but later released him without initiating criminal prosecution.
Prosecutors said the man was arrested again on Saturday on the basis of new evidence, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present a "semaphore" for epidemiological measures
The new system is set to play the role of a pandemic plan, due to the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"They will gradually be according to the power of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in each region varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS).
Specific measures will be imposed at each stage, according to the minister, whether it is the obligation to wear robes or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Prime Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Party television programme, according to which people should have clear information about what measures to expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented on this by saying that there is no point in talking about the declaration of a state of emergency or the re-convention of the crisis staff.
Given the growing number of people infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic, the government has again imposed the obligation to wear robes at internal events for more than 100 people.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's move, when it was not clear at the last moment what measures would come into effect and when they would be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a sense of certainty and, on the contrary, rectify the confusion," Senator Marek Hilscher said in Questions.
Measures can already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear gowns even in non-residential medical facilities, i.e., in pharmacies or in waiting rooms with a doctor.
The obligation to wear gowns when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced since Friday in the Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear robes in indoor public spaces, in public roads and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian Silesian Region, the anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly adjusts the rules applicable for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities do not require Czech citizens to have a negative test for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory upon the return of Czechs from high-risk countries.
Currently, all EU Member States are in the category of low-risk countries.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues.
Playing on a third capacity, it was supposed to finish at noon
Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko continues on Sunday evening.
One-third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates, there are about 500 people left after 20:00, the original gross estimates were three hundred, the morning was 900, police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková said.
Originally, the techno parties were supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems actually stopped.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
The music production is still in progress.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and disassembly of the music systems," Nováková said.
“Police are still strictly monitoring outgoing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before leaving,” she added.
Dozens of police officers are overseeing the event, foreign police, traffic and police officers are on site, and service dogs are also on standby.
"During today, police checked 470 people moving at the scene of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers underwent a breath test, of which six were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novakova said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also handled 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people attended the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
This was said by Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD).
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, nor did the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health request it.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the technoparties have also expanded to surrounding land, the owners of which did not agree to the use for the technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation for damages.
Fans of techno came to the meadow near Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally guarded a meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>imi, Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk, where the technoparties took place last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavá<0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota, where the technicians eventually actually settled.
According to the newcomers, no one came to the Bla<0xC5><0xBE>imi.
Snake stuttering: The girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in <0xC5><0xBD>eleznorudsk.
The snake stabbed a girl in the foot there, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," the regional health service spokeswoman Mária Svobodová told Diník that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The snake is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the forest that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no major danger from these animals.
The odds of a snake biting you are not too high, with normal contact, she is afraid on her own.
And if there's room for that, she likes to sneak away after a loud sigh.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Its bite is not a tragedy, but its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk is particularly high for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting after a bite, sweats, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from Klatov Hospital told Diník.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
After the policeman lil wine and throwing dishes
After 11:00 p.m., an intervention unit entered the apartment and detained the men.
The infants were immediately taken care of by the health care provider, said regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after a police negotiation he threw dishes, knives or poured wine out of the window.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiation by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
One day he even climbed onto the window sill where he was barking.
Police are still investigating the man.
Further information is not yet available to the public.
Stosurová prefers daughter to tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be able to compete in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
Thirty-six-year-old champion of the US Open 2011, who became a mother in June, but does not want to end her career yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to her family and daughter, she will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones our Evie will experience in the next six months, and I'm just going to enjoy it," she said.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on 3 August with an anthem tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razie reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the site transported 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of at the asana facility," the state veterinary administration said.
When checking the live fish stand, it was found that the seller does not have proof of the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for the long term.
For example, last fall, veterinarians uncovered an illegal grocery store with almost half a ton of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
For the majority, the date of consumption could not be determined, part of the products had a shelf life and was corrupted.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, algae or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky before ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire will begin at midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday, negotiators from Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new armistice with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is set to begin after midnight on Monday, to be "complete and general" and to pave the way for further provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in an interview with Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament ruled that local elections would not take place in a territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk agreement expects Kiev to regain control of the Ukrainian separatist-occupied lands with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and organizing local elections.
Zelensky's office said the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and on the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining combat areas or withdrawing some of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea, and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional shootings and artillery attacks.
The Donbass conflict has killed more than 14,000 people since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskyy made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet occurred.
The unexpected master of ten-bowl is Rykl, the seven-bowl has mastered Novotná
Defender of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al did not reach the end of Saturday's four-point program, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> did not jump the foundation in the bar on Sunday.
Tentiboji was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the disk.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outside of the Czech Republic, this time he was the only ten-year-old to get across the seven-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand.
Other medals were won by Vilém Strásk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, he recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a person about 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and the most disappointed was probably the disk, there I was below average," he admitted on the union's Facebook page.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachová won the first day of the seven-match with more than one-hundred-point lead, despite her injured ankle on her reflex leg.
In the distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not exceed 40 meters with a spear and did not step into the final eighth.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková.
The distance is 631 cm, the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was about 630.
"Yesterday I started to feel a lump, but I'm very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotna said on Facebook.
Bio LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to gasoline or oil, given the significantly lower excise duties, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per mile driven.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its eco-friendly variant - "bio LPG".
But it is quite a novelty - the front panel appeared on the European market for the first time and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press release of the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio-LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in combination with classical fossil LPG," says Primagas association director Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Karlík.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically similar to the classic oil LPG, which a number of motorists are now refueling their cars.
Therefore, both versions can also be mixed arbitrarily.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the way it is produced," says Ivan Indra<0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the association.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced specifically, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio-LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on oil LPG and up to 90% more environmentally friendly compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, that is, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio-LPG currently includes the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles are running on LPG; the Ministry of Environment reports a slightly higher number, about 200,000 in the Czech Republic.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, nearly 6,000 LPG-powered car conversions were carried out last year alone.
In the Czech Republic, LPG can be refueled at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to review the numbers of coronavirus infected.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from 5,254 to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer infected.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"At the back of the jumping increase in the number of cured is the revision of data that has not been able to update hygiene recently," said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had been infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence option.
Politologist and Sociologist Searched for Variants for Pandemic Time
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), a change in the law is needed to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He told the Prime Party TV on Sunday.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties in the ministry.
“Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law,” Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the applicable legal rules.
But the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine can not vote because of their health condition.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM show that the possibility of correspondence choice has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then expects its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overrated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could take place as early as this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main thing is to be ready for the year 2021, when the parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
Others see the already mentioned electoral units or the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries this year.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown by protesters at the government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was another of a series of protests against the "mafia style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade at the center, the DPA agency said.
Today’s protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Svoboda.
By 8:00 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
The protesters played a theater scene in front of the government building, in which they symbolically locked in the prison cell Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the main demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to the corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadzhigenov, said on public law radio on Wednesday that a "peak of escalation" in the form of "a national demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country" is about to take place.
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has said he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need for Bulgaria to carry out the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team, although the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government suspended the vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> no longer wants matches without spectators
Boloni coach Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> has had enough of Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the next season.
“What we’re doing right now is not football.
I'm already full of matches without spectators.
It's genderless football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so,” Mihajlovic said ahead of today’s match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, Serie A matches follow in a quick succession, and although they are played until evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under these conditions, you don’t even know how the teams are.
Let this season be over.
These measures had to be taken in order for the competition to finish, but I hope that from September there will be fans back," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D>, this season is also unusual because he was missing for four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
“Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move to a higher level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that, we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses have reported fires and explosions.
Some Iranian officials said the fire that erupted in the underground nuclear facility in Natanz this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will succeed in repelling it.
In recent months, according to Musáví, there have been several broader cyberattacks, behind which, according to analyses, "certain governments and groups" have stood.
However, he did not disclose details of the suspects, according to Reuters.
Musáví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state agency IRNA this month argued that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the United States, could be behind recent incidents.
Neither of these countries, however, was directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut off diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and a member of the Iraqi militia leadership Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8th, Iran fired at bases in Iraq, where Americans are operating, a number of missiles.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers have been wounded.
Israel sees Iran as its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n Automobile (TPCA) has again extended production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25th morning.
The rally will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said automotive spokesman Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek.
Production has been on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
Initially, the company planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the pause is, according to Paroubka, closed borders and closed dealerships, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce at 100 percent from the start, i.e. on two shifts.
The coronavirus affects key markets such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Amendment for Cologne) said that the TPCA production stoppage does not sign on life in the city.
"In the beginning it was known, in the city it was empty.
But the streets are gradually filling up, especially now since Monday, when a lot has unfolded.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with the foreign workers who stayed in the shelters.
"In those two months, we didn't have to solve almost any problem," Kaspar said.
For example, <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday 27 April at all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
None of the races are running at 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygienic measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the restoration of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2,500 people and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employers in Cologne.
Cancer Kills Bride Shortly After Marriage: Leaves Message to Family
For more than two years, Gemma Sisson had been battling cancer, and when it seemed that she had beaten the cancer, the disease reappeared.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she had yet to take her life’s love.
Unfortunately, the disease succumbed.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her friend Ricky Moore, with whom she has lived for more than 16 years, she has travelled through competitions taking place around the world.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman exercised and lived a healthy life, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, in hopes of healing.
After months of treatment, it actually seemed that Gemma had managed to overcome the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time she attacked the spine.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spine surgery and then resumed drastic treatment.
However, everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-nineth birthday, doctors announced that she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde finally decided to go to the hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her with her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
“If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all of my followers on the social network,” she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, amulets from mushrooms and pexeso
For a hundred crowns he receives a passing pocket work mostly by beginner Czech artists.
They create images and other creations directly for artmat, knowing ahead that they have to fit in sizes of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer may thus be surprised at what kind of artwork he acquires.
Currently, he can become a new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Stoplova or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutkova prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague walk.
Cards should be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Julián Chomová sell a pocket pack of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the teddy bear and a fortune-telling card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritistka.
Healthcare salaries will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch
Health care salaries could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) said in Václav Moravce’s Questions on Czech Television.
The demand by the unions for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in securing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think the increase (in salaries) could be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March she has intervened in the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government's decree against its spread.
Income of insurance companies declined at the time.
"A 15 percent increase at this point seems unrealistic to me," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS), the average monthly earnings of doctors in acute bed care are likely to reach 88,312, nurses 47,498 crowns this year.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
UZIS data also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019 was 34 125 kronor, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in public hospitals, which must be guided by payrolls, and contract salaries in hospitals in cities, districts or private ones.
They therefore also require uniform payrolls for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, in the case of doctors, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the President of the Czech Chamber of Dentistry Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the unions should be able to see what is going on at the moment.
Due to the impact of the COVID epidemic, the House recently approved an increase in this year’s state budget deficit to a record 500 billion kronor, of which 1.75 billion is to be spent on health-care benefits in hospitals and social services.
According to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with a flat wage increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, the head of the Administration of State Massive Reserves (SSHR), said this week that the administration currently does not own a single protective medical device.
Waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were purchased.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
A shrinking smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We're ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, there is something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they shouldn’t run it again,” the prime minister said on his Facebook page, Ciao People.
According to him, it is not possible to connect IT systems and hygiene stations sufficiently, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were according to the prime minister in the Moravian-Silesian region, where some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic are.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he had no information on Sunday's talks and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up by the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
He also said that he could be taken back by the army.
The shortcomings in the project were also previously admitted by the government’s IT and digitalization commissioner, Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project.
“The system is working, but we’re still working on it.
Twenty years it was created independently and non-systemically, now in a few months we are trying to unify it.
It's not a nozzle.
People on the march, poor hygienists on the march are adapting these new systems and actually catching the errors,” he said.
Mayor of Ostrava Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "mistake in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is an attempt to "not get lost in politics," he told the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidency of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd last one term and with that experience in business, I can turn it all around and get on my feet in that time," he told Respect.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent during the second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don’t want to go into politics,” added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about the possible end of Macur in the YO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example, for allied with the SPD or for supporting Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few UN personalities, he supported anti-Zeman anti-candidate Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Draho<0xC5><0xA1> in the elections.
From the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
“As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is involved in it, I do not have an immediate motive to stop,” he told Respect.
Sixty-six-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served among others as director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also held meetings with other companies.
Uber to return to Brno offering transportation services
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, offering transportation services.
This is a consequence of the amendment of the law, said on Thursday in a press statement the Brno City Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as the label as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, with the amendment of the law, the conditions for the operation of regular and alternative taxis have changed since July.
In recent weeks, he has held several meetings with Uber representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has been operating in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not labeling the vehicles as taxis or missing taximeters.
The court issued a preliminary ruling banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year mayor Markéta Va<0xC5><0x88>ková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
Now they will return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with lights and a taximeter, it is easier to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications.
Too buoyant celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a meter from a man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment building, an office chair flew out on Saturday night in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a pedestrian who immediately called the police.
Immediately after arriving at the address mentioned in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which the chairs were still lying, and next to it several cans and cans.
"The movement from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went out through the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the police.
The request for the appeal of Rafa will be discussed by Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans to discuss on Monday with the coalition social democrats a request for a proposal to dismiss the head of the antitrust office (UOHS) Peter Rafai.
The appeal of Rafah was called on by non-profit organizations to hold meetings of the anti-corruption council of the government and also the <0xC3><0x9A>stí kraj.
The Social Democrats say that the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>TK, Rafai was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
The second term of office expires in the middle of next year, according to the law, he cannot be appointed a third time.
Its appeal is within the competence of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the call for non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí kraj.
The reason for this is among other things Rafa's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that the materials would be read and the government parties would take "some position" on the request.
He also said he had not yet negotiated the challenge with the president and had no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafai was not charged with anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last week wrote that the police are interested in Rafajo’s meeting with hetman Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek strongly advocates.
Chunek admitted to the meeting, according to him, they jointly dealt with his "senatical activities".
Rafa speaks the same way.
The representative office of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region called on the government to withdraw Rafah at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
<0xC3><0x9A>OHS’ decision on public procurement according to the deputy hetman for transport Jaroslav Komínka is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened in the antitrust office over a tender for the collection of tolls.
This year in June, the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written for the company of the influential behind-the-scenes player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexandra <0xC4><0x8C>uby.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafajo’s account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition has been Rafah since 9 July 2009, for the second term the President appointed a former Social Democracy Member in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaji's second six-year term will expire.
The Antitrust Act states that the president may appeal to the head of the office on a proposal from the government.
It may be revoked only if it has not held office for more than six months or seriously violates the dignity of its office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The staff of the Blanen library were collapsing in the heat.
Air Conditioning Helps
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warmer months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
There was a lot of heat and bad air.
The ventilation didn't help.
That’s why I like air conditioning,” said one of Blanen’s readers, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the library Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Dlapy, temperatures in the building often climbed up to more than thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it functions as a greenhouse.
"The sun is leaning on it for much of the day thanks to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual compartments, because overnight the windows must be closed for security reasons.
Often we have from the morning in the library to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the study room and the reading room on the third floor.
And the showroom and the director's office are upstairs.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians were collapsing at work and ended up in incapacity for work.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no more breathing," Dlapa said.
Originally, the city's representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of the limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic spaces.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," said Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Svoboda from the Blanen investment department.
He added that in the first phase, workers installed air conditioning and electrical installations in the aforementioned premises last autumn.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko City Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of these, it is about nine hundred to fifteen years.
The Chicago Resistance has evicted the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to a player from the NHL who is silent about the health of the players like a grave and does not disclose anything at all.
He was one of the few to step out of the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old from Montreal was only present at the first training session, since then he has been absent from the group.
"I would like to announce to all of you that I have been tested positive for COVID-19 and because of that I have spent the last fourteen days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicague, the solid part of the goalkeeper is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are expected to face St. Louis in a pre-season duel, then face Edmonton in the pre-season.
Thousands protest in Israel against Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places in the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dealing with the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks now.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of a process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is tackling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
Netanyahu, 70, is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried in court.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all charges and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which has a population of about nine million, has been confirmed in almost 60,500 people in Israel.
About 455 people have died from the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce daily increases in infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, however, the number of infected people began to rise significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics say the government has not provided enough help to businesses affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also troubled by the fact that the government is issuing contradictory guidelines in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
The body must have been removed from the wreckage by firefighters.
The tragic accident occurred around 23.00 near Neveklov in the narrow district leading from the Slapska dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at considerable speed and crashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be released from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
End of wasting and swallowing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is committed to this by fundamentally changing its strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to sniff one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is not new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills each year.
The view of slow fashion, often a despised approach to dressing, has changed quite rapidly in recent years.
Approximately half of the goods were sold to Pietro Filipi at full price.
The other half, which sold thanks to discounts, will not buy.
The company does not want to squeeze one collection after another and at the end of each season discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most traders already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it’s kind of a scam,” says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, the company wants to support local businesses with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothing that is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for a discount," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant graffiti depicts RAF fighter Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The project was well received by the city's management," said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intense work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, he was taken to an internment camp by the Nazis because of his Jewish background, where he was held for several weeks.
He and his brother, however, managed to escape the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig entered the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in South Africa's Rhodesia and Palestine.
He took part in combat operations in early 1945.
After the velvet revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and the native Teplice, who granted him an honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, 64, known in the street art industry as Camo, has been spraying on the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the grounds designated for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna hits the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight) local time.
He hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened in a tropical storm as he moved across the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, according to the AP, power outages and various material damages are reported, including damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total it is expected to hit an area nearly 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous hail and unique tornadoes can pose a threat,” the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning, local time (afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) a storm was moving in the U.S.-Mexico border area and was accompanied by winds at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season.
Over the Gulf of Mexico it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it progressed to the mainland it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which once again excluded Hanna from the category of hurricanes.
Local authorities have urged residents to cope with the storms at home, not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with the distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter after evacuated people who had tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuated people to take their masks and disinfectant gels with them to shelter, if possible.
“We’re not far behind yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Predictions suggest that in some places it could rain up to 300 millimeters of rainfall in a matter of hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which together with sea level rise could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman to lend the rank of Colonel-General to Lipko
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavlo Lipko on Wednesday.
This is the result of a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for the lending of the rank of Brigadier General is the August entry of Lipka into the post of deputy commander of the Alliance multinational division in northeastern Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, he will replace Brigadier General Karl <0xC5><0x98>ehku as deputy commander of the multinational division northeast in the Polish Elblag, which commands the units of the Alliance's advanced presence on the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Mr. <0xC5><0x98>ehka became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (N<0xC3><0x9A>KIB).
The government proposed to the president to grant Lipko the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on Occupational Soldiers, a higher rank may be awarded to a soldier for the duration of the exercise of the elected office or for the duration of the service requiring the award of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the rank of general.
A soldier to whom a rank has been conferred has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he does not have the right to adjust the salary that corresponds to the rank.
The lending of the rank continues until the reason for which it was granted is omitted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
It will play a significant role in the fulfilment of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defense said in June.
The Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, with the participation of Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Abata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
EU countries have agreed on common standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the distance or wearing of robes in the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain vacant.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
Measures agreed include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance at security checks and check-in at the airport.
Enough fresh air must be guaranteed in the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy middle seats.
The common rules agreed upon by the officials shall meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Differing standards have caused confusion.
In the Arctic Spitzbergs fell the temperature record, there measured almost 22 degrees
"In Longyearbyen, the 41-year-old record has fallen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, surpassing the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Spitzbergen region, located about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spitzbergen are warming up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in the Spitzbergs has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could even rise by ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced to the atmosphere.
Temperature rises in the Spitzbergs can result in the melting of ever-frozen soils, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and causing more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which are dependent on the ice cover of the ocean.
The British who return from Spain are expected to face a mandatory two-week quarantine.
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential trips to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must remain in isolation for two weeks.
The new rules will enter into force at midnight.
“Protection of public health is our absolute priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British diplomat said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a certain country from the safe list," she said.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the world.
Among other things, the British have concerns about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in solitary confinement for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day vacation to Lanzarote, they were scheduled to leave on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go with the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
“I work as a driver and I don’t think my employer will agree that I will be quarantined for two weeks after I return from vacation,” Hunter said in a statement.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 newly infected people have been added in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid area.
Government discusses model of electricity purchase from Dukovan
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The bill expects that if the redemption price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the redemption price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final electricity price for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ have already stated that a more likely variant is that people will save for electricity thanks to construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
This has been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both below the market price of power electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can thus be both negative and positive.
The impact is distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at Dukovan will make money.
Otherwise, the impact in dozens of crowns per year will be per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported sources.
Earlier, he estimated that the redemption price could range between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it is to be included only in the redemption contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now the most stockpiled, is currently around 45 euros (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"The difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity for electricity of ten euros could make an average household surcharge with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four households, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including electric hobs and ovens, but does not use 100 meters of electricity.
“We are living in a very turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative matter," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, CEO of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law assumes that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO or the legal entity entrusted by it owned by the state at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated ones, but not longer than the end of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines nuclear reactor power generation as connected to an electrical system with installed capacity with a minimum electrical power of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the model of financing the new Dukovan block on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state at the time of construction without interest, for operation it is calculated with a 2% interest rate.
The opposition does not agree with the funding model, and it also dislikes the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should have a 70 percent stake in the construction.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
CEO of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kronor).
Contracts between the state and <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The Czech Ministry of Local Development (MMR) plans to spend two billion crowns on media, internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) of the SeznamZpravy.cz server said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was highlighted on Friday by the Zdopravy.cz server.
The ministry justified the plan with the failure of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, there was a decline in revenue and in the media.
The proposal provoked criticism from both the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism CzechTourism for advertising in television, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or spaces at the stations.
The largest share of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
The majority would be private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weekly newspapers would receive $400 million and the same amount would be given to MMR for PR articles, banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of which are private stations.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or in the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and take a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented," Dosta<0xC5><0x82>ová said without further details of the server ListingNews.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the advertising would benefit the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this outrageous contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn elections," she wrote on Twitter.
She denies that it is in fact the aid of the media affected by the crises.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told Dinika N on Friday.
According to her, the budget is indicative of two billion.
“Of course, we’re still counting, it can be less and more.
It’s work material,” she added.
“Save Tourism” does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D>ík, chairman of the initiative.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed at companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
A broth from life, a cock of beer and death as a stalk of grass
The third album titled And Death is the grass stem of the Brno poet, the tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, who also left a year ago, on May 24, is also posthumous.
It is the fifth item in Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ovo’s discography and, like previous titles, there is the main emphasis on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ovo’s poetry, which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, born in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration passed through his own personal experiences and also very inner manifestations of faith.
However, he was at a distance from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jana Zahradní<0xC4><0x8D>kova, for example), the masters will apologize.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ovo's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Klí<0xC4><0x8D> or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and Vít<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - in the words of the Ostrava poet Peter Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poetry compositions.
"They were filled with proud and endless bitterness," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is increasingly falling into dull consumer vanity and rudeness is increasingly moving away from what his soul was created from—the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was a squeeze in them of one who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be renounced only because of a general lack of interest.
These poems reminded us that a man may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not insignificant how he loses it.
If he sells himself to a general bankruptcy, he resigns skeptically, is silent in fear, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves.
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, former Prime Minister and President of the Czech SSD, is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
Party leader and Interior Minister Jan Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
That's what the hammock said today on the TV show Prima Partie.
About the fact that Paroubek should be the advisor of Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>k, on Friday reported the server SeznamZv<0xC3><0xBD>ry.cz.
"We write an e-mail from time to time, he sends me some material from time to time and I read it," Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
He added, however, that this is not official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I read his opinion from time to time, so there are a lot of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochová, the minister said that many members of the ODS still "undercoverly listen to the views of Václav Klaus".
It is okay, he said, because he is an experienced politician and a former leader of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that the media turns it into an affair has marked this year’s cucumber season.
The SeznamZv<0xC3><0xBD>ry.cz server wrote on Friday that Paroubek is playing the role of Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the party’s candidate for fourth place in the Uzbekistan region is the former cell president Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as the deputy leader of his party LEV 21.
Hamá<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mileage, it's a kick in the ass, woe to the Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to defeat a two-year-old Duplantis, who last year defeated him at a meeting of the NCAA University Association.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we threw it away.
In both cases, it was a very good match," Nilsen describes, who secured the victory with a 5.95 metre performance.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upwards and is currently lonely in the highest spheres.
In just twenty years, he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Toru<0xC5><0x84> he overcame a bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he finished high school," Nilsen told World Athletics.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew from a boy to a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent by ten.
"Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record," he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of achievements is thinner than Duplantis’s, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he has won regularly, in February this year on one of them he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last year in August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he entered the American expedition to the world championship, where
The closest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there,” he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead the way at events such as the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to reach the Duplantis, which can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere battle for silver?
“Everyone is trying to catch him up, but I don’t think that’s going to be possible anytime soon,” Nilsen said.
"He's been jumping for 16 years and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo starts in 2021, it will want to increase it even more.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands on the disability pension of an incapacitated son.
The court awaits her
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for adultery.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of justice and appointed his mother a caregiver, who was to manage, among other things, the money of his son.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, a woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her own needs and prepared him for a loss of CZK 440,000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said in a statement.
According to court orders, the woman set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase the vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the prosecution said.
That he could not use his son's money for his own necessities, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping to pay for family expenses.
“We had problems with our income to tighten the house.
We never bought anything over-the-top.
It was always on things that my son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I didn’t know I was committing a crime,” the woman told police.
He promised to give the money back to his son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, people inhabited the cave of Chiquihuite, located at a high altitude, for 20,000 years.
So far, a widely accepted theory has suggested that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
However, this model got cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, describes 42 different locations across North America that prove human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to America by boat.
"It's clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called human culture," said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.
Interest in tickets so far fills the optimistic scenario, say the sellers.
Prices are also gradually decreasing.
Flight ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent each week.
The development after the crisis thus fulfills the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
According to the sellers, South European countries are among the most sought-after destinations.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
On the website Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, the most sold flights to Croatia are to Split.
Of the other countries, the most sought-after is the United Kingdom, which, however, has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of tickets is also decreasing.
At the portal Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, about 6250 kronor was moved in the middle of the month, about 3000 kronor less per year.
This is mainly due to the increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European countries, such as Spain or Italy, have also fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information on Kiwi.com, the time to buy a flight before departure has been reduced by about ten days per year.
"This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Shindelá<0xC5><0x99>, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth of sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
There are currently scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations at Prague Airport.
Compared to last year’s summer season, it’s about half of the destinations.

As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited from the current thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded the limit of 16 million.
This was reported by Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died from COVID-19 is close to 645,000.

In recent days, the United States, which has already recorded over 4.1 million cases, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
Infected people are now growing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said this week that more than 284,000 new cases were reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily record since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populated states such as the United States, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in nearly 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced today by the DPRK.
The air in homes is up to five times worse than outdoors.
Air fresheners and deodorants are harmful to health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in the outdoors, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the creation of Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, the focus needs to be on household pests right now, as many people spend more time working from home.
According to research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), home air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on home air quality," she said.
In Israel, almost no one is concerned with the quality of “home air”.
Dangerous can be the things with which a person commonly comes into contact - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The clothes we regularly carry to the dry cleaner also emit poisonous gas," said Abraham.
The most at risk are children, elderly members of the household and people with breathing difficulties.
Even otherwise healthful individuals can begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
Not all pesticides, however, come from objects inside households, and the material from which houses are built can also be a source.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada came to the team for a chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to the coronavirus.
The management of the competition cancelled the postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the play off.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for COVID-19 in the club to 28.
Due to the disease in the team was postponed Monday's duel against La Coruni, in which Fuenlabrada had enough point to get into the play off.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitively revoked with regard to the higher power due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
On the contrary, La Coruña is storming against not winning the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place as usual complete in a single term.

The first two teams of the Huesca and Cádiz tables have the certainty of progress between the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will face the remaining third place in the play off.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
Dominic's daughter revealed it.
"Dad didn't need him for many years," God's eldest daughter, Dominic, told Aha!, saying that the Master couldn't find Havloi's name, and that whenever he got a word from her, Karla was always upset.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute started sometimes in the mid-1990s.
"My dad said in an article after the revolution that it was easier for him.
That Havel could have written in a drawer at a dark time, but if he had somehow resisted, he would have ended his career," Gottová said.
But he adds that Czech giants have finally found their way back together.
"I know he couldn't hear the word Havel until he was sixty.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday and suddenly Dad’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his seventies at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
“And that’s where the new era of their relationship began, because Mr. Havel’s dad regularly invited him home to Bertram,” added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavíka was also disgusted that she had never received a state award from Václav Havel.
After all, he met him in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor in office Václav Klaus (79).
The next honor will be in memoriam, because the current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to give him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
