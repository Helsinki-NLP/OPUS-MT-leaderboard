Welsh ministers worry about “looking like a fool”
Uggur is in some councillors because of a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns have arisen over the plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Counsellors from all walks of life are concerned that this could make them laugh.
One member of the Labour Party said that his party was concerned that "it is inconsistent with Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means stool.
Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and had made other suggestions for the name.
An official from the Welsh Conservative Party said his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet (floor).
In this context it may be noted that the Welsh character w is spoken similarly to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is currently working on a legislative proposal to submit the name changes, said: “The final decision on all names that are headed over the member of the Council will, of course, be left to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act (2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the council published the results of a public opinion poll that showed a lot of support for calling the council the Welsh parliament.
As for the title of councillors, the council chose the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh parliamentarians) while the MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to reports, the ministers are now making other proposals, but it could be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft on the changes within a few weeks.
The draft reforms will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the withdrawal of directors and the organisation of the committee system.
Counsellors will be able to cast a final vote on their title when the debate on the draft begins.
Macedonians to Vote in Elections on Name Change in the Country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the “Republic of North Macedonia.”
This issue was put to a vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said he will not look at the elections as valid.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have, however, said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Church Clock St. Martin's Sounds Churches in Harlem Have Trouble
“The older people I’ve talked to said earlier that you should find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“There’s nothing there today.”
He said it was understandable that the bars were decreasing.
“People have other ways of meeting” these days, he said.
“Bars are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people gather regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back to the starting line.”
He added that churches could possibly be replaced by dwellings that were full of people who would not help to save the nearby surviving fortresses.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white,” he said, “and will hence hasten the closure of these churches forever, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of black - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1940s.
A group of blacks who had worked in the vicinity took over the building.
Under the leadership of Sir John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to recruit shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who were eager to hire or provide jobs for darkened workers, a congregation of darker people took over St. Martin’s Church.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Ser Johnson made plans to rebuild it and they also had the bell tower built.
Sir David Johnson, son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the bell ring a proud "clock of the poor people."
The expert who played the bell in July called it a different name: “a cultural treasure” and “a unique historical instrument.”
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the world’s first bell to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, but he moved on to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not received anyone else in his place.
In the past month, many architects and developers have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by the leaders of the church and others from the diocese.
The Council of the Church, which oversees the parish and is appointed by the Church leaders, wrote the episcopal case in July, expressing its concern that the episcopal case “is seeking to cover the costs” of the Church, even if the Council had not done so.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dived on Lobster in California
Authorities say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed over with a group of others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill to have gotten a lobster, but then “he realized that the boy shouted, ‘I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
All the bones on him were torn up," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Coast Guard chief Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered a serious injury to the upper part of the body.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to rebuild the UK’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic shelves in the shopping mall style and with dedicated assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is growing steadily as sales of fashion and household goods decrease. Larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be placed in more genes if more genes are added.
Investment in cosmetics is part of a large market for using shelf space previously used by televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it plans to double its cosmetics range in up to 3,000 product types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be given increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also plans to resume selling its Boutique cosmetics range so that most of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test product status in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, South London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores means that large markets need to invest more to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would resemble shopping malls more and more as the chain tries to fight the low-end Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced the history of a number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The store’s previous attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s tested its partnership with Boots around 2000, but that ended due to a dispute over how the proceeds from the sale of drugs should be distributed in large markets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 drug stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy stores, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Under the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a large range of luxury leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, head of marketing at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve redesigned our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be within reach for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs. A fascinating environment and convenient locations make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones is 'eternally upset' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became "eternal" after TV designer Holly Willoughby quit an 11-million-pound deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, a brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37, who starred in the series This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a still-painted departure from a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones has been "reliable" at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the popular TV presenter admitted she didn't have enough time for the household and accessories brand Truly to allocate 1.5 points due to the new agreement.
The company has been similar to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double the assets of Willoughby, but their estimated value is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was planning to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A spokesperson said: “Truly was long on Holly’s priority list.
This was supposed to be her future project that would take her over the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely out of the question.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line moved to the market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow Headquarters that are ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the disappearance of This Morning, which is among the UK’s most popular star, can cost the company millions due to large product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and possibly cause further delays in the purchase of the product.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends of Jones and Töra Capp, his wife, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summer holidays together and Jones a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television producer.
Willoughby will become the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV series I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It’s been a long time since we’ve fallen in love.”
He was disgusted by the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would find inappropriate for a president, and for being so positive in favor of the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump responded by shouting the voice of a reporter.
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He pointed out that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks on putting down nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's chief ambassador, told international leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received a "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps of the North's approach.
He said that instead, the United States continued to encourage businesspeople for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was even more optimistic in his speech.
“We have a great relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
“Our relationship is great now.”
He said his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim had been successful - the missile tests had ceased, the hostages had been released and the ground remains of U.S. soldiers had been returned home.
He also took an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into the crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia have caused severe damage to the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international aid organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to flee their homes, a state of emergency has not been declared, but it is a prerequisite for the international organization to have relief activities there.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not intend to ask for assistance from international organisations, so this is difficult,” said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear when foreign aid workers can have jobs in the area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Given the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly ill-prepared to defend itself against natural disasters.
Flood barriers have been erected in Aceh but are rarely seen on other shores.
It seems that the waiting for flood protection flares in Palu has increased the number of casualties, even though a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
An ambulance that has landed at the port of Lombok to spot the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main focus of his election campaign to rebuild Indonesia’s downhill transit routes and has put a lot of money into roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko’s administration, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have committed themselves to a more conservative religion.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes as Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a broadcast from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the goal of Chelsea when his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot a goal towards the spring rod.
The ball flew high above the goal and towards its right angle.
The ball finally passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to make myself as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come in and touched once and didn’t think too much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the playoffs, the Chelsea player handed the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovacic and then jumped from the center to Liverpool.
Kovacic let the ball pass quickly between the center.
Then he sent the ball elegantly forward and sent Hazard in for a pass.
Hazard ran away from the defenders and scored in the far corner with a left-footed shot ahead of Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the semi-finals at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after floods in Indonesia
The death toll from the earthquake and flooding in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report by the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization, said at a news conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale. The earthquake caused flooding that reached a height of 6.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was roofed by collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with an ulcer was found at 7:55 a.m. near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to give up if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O’Hagan, the research commissioner, said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have taken a picture with their car cameras, to contact us, as they might have important information for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who died had lived in Birkenhead and that she had been found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say they are working to let the victims’ closest relatives know.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back into his apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may take until they are allowed to return.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now considered to be a scene of crime.
A weeping woman came to the scene.
She keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the police area and one car just outside.
A number of police officers stood in front of the marked area and monitored the residential buildings.
Anyone who may have any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymously at the Crime Line on 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's abbreviation of the British Parliament is the latest memorial accused of "rewriting history"
The ban on the statue would be a poetic justification for the Taliban's destruction of his perfidious Puritan companions on so many of England's cultural and religious dynasties.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick’s suggestion was “fake” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate over removing the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be in front of the bar.
The end of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither an order nor an execution by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the beginning of the 19th century and is part of the history of a man many believe to still deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of the House against outside pressure, in his case the Kingdom.
There is still a lot of historical contention as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that were in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who is a representative of one side of their conflict.
It is worth paying tribute and remembering his accomplishments as the protector of the state.”
Pig attacks Chinese farmer and kills him
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local reports.
The man, who is named only after his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a stall at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, according to reports from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He said he had travelled with his uncle from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pig shop was open.
He said there had been a big hole in the wall with a bloody mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kg of golem had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded,” the uncle, nicknamed “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News newsroom.
Footage from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while police gathered evidence on the scene.
According to the news, the Yuan family and the owners of the market are in talks about compensation for his death.
There have been reports that pigs have attacked people, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts home and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years ago, 300 kg of Welsh pigs were clamped by a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that bloody flavours can arouse aggressiveness in them.
“They’re just playing.
They like to sneak and are curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Rose's cataclysm bring heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, the strength of Rosa’s hurricane is decreasing as it crosses the cooler ocean off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring with it heavy rainfall that could cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane with wind speeds up to 136 km/h, at 5 a.m. East Coast Time on Sunday, and it was located more than 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go northwards on Sunday.
At the same time, it is low in formation over the Pacific and will head east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California Range on Monday as a warming storm, a major warming earthquake will follow in the north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Roses will follow up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the warm-belt shrapnel will mix with the approaching lowlands, forming a large and widespread rainfall over the southwestern part in the coming days.
Local rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm can cause dangerous flash floods, movement of soil and possible sediments in the desert.
High temperatures will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in Arizona County.
There is a possibility of sudden floods with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of warm-belt rains.
People are strongly advised against going on foot in the desert when there is a risk of warming.
Heavy rainfall can turn gulls into blizzards and thunderstorms can lead to storms and storms.
The approaching basin will entail local drainage in certain areas of the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation that could cause minor movement on the ground and hedgehogs on the roads.
This is the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Several scattered hotspots will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads across larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rainfall will spread across four counties on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
In October, large changes in temperature are expected throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the temperature is still rather warm.
Sometimes this can cause large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A good example of the high temperatures in the central United States could be seen on Sunday.
There is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and spread out again.
A large part of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm in early October with temperatures of around 25 degrees or more from the plains in the south to the northeastern states.
The temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term prediction suggests that there is a high likelihood of temperatures above average for the eastern United States in the first part of October.
More than 20 million people watched the interrogation of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by the Supreme Court, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual offence that should have occurred in the 1990s.
At the same time, the political stance continued and television stations paused their regular agenda to release the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator in the U.S. Senate, tabled a bill to allow the FBI to investigate the case on its own.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was sure that Kavanaugh had sniffed her drunk and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was sure that it would not have happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen said had watched on Friday.
The company measured average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other television channels that showed the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to the size of the final game in football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews, which took place throughout the day, were watched on Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. The views of that channel have supported the nomination of Kavanaugh diligently.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Congressman's Republican Party announced that he would elect Kavanaugh in favor, CNN and CBS seized pictures of it when protesters summoned him on Friday morning, as he tried to enter the elevator meeting to die.
He stood down for a few minutes while it was raining on him in a live broadcast on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
The people said to him, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would speak more at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all broadcast live later when the Judicial Committee chose whether to forward Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Elders’ Department for election.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's vote replaced the original because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'being in a political game' over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “being in a political game” about Britain’s future and burying the country’s interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published alongside her front page interview, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, granted the so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should "remove any customs duties" should be lifted.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect in the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting. He was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
Authorities released a video of the conflicts between Sims and Simpsons and said the Sims have lost their glasses in the confrontation.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they had found genetic material from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, a sister company of CBS.
Police say Simpson has confessed to interrogations that he shot and killed Wayde.
According to his lawyer, a certain amount of insurance was $350,000.
The forensic examiner's office in East Baton Rouge County issued an emergency report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and throat.
Authorities wanted to thank a special police force in Louisiana, the police crime investigation office, the police at Southern University University, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, president of sports at LSU, thanked law enforcement for “his bravery and pursuit of justice.”
The Sims was 20 years old.
The high-grown two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 rebounds for each game in the last game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that the team was "harmfully beaten" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
“It’s something you’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
A mountain of fire spits ashes over Mexico City
The ashes of the Mount of Fire Popocatepetl have reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the volcano, and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitored by vibrations and tremors from the mountain of fire.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Geologists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake on the Richter Ride over central Mexico in September 2017.
The mountain of fire, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatist right for the anniversary of the independence votes cast
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters responded to riot police and thousands took part in protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence vote.
A group of disguised separatists stoned a riot police force with eggs and threw powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, which were usually full of tourists.
Conflicts also broke out later in the day and police used clubs to hold back.
Groups of separatists shouted: “We do not forget and we do not forgive” for several hours while their opponents shouted: “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen of them had to be apprehended for minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to local media.
There is still a lot of tension in the independent region one year after the October 1 vote was condemned illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters opted for independence but the turnout was poor as most of those opposed to separation ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were displaced last year when police tried to halt the elections at polling stations across the region, which had led to clashes.
Groups of pro-independence activists had spent the night outside on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country's police.
The protest went on, but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in a divorce protest with his wife, saying he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“We had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because I could kiss, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but significant victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalonia’s independence parties have had a hard time keeping up this year, with many of their best-known leaders either being arbitrarily exiled or being held in custody.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the protests in support of the police on her phone, said politicians in both counties had urged the dispute.
“The tension keeps rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and asked for trial since late last year, announced that he would present himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My message in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the area of democratic values and the oppression we have seen the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car hits house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving repeatedly to a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Bob Blemmings, a research officer, said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the shot was from a crossbow in the direction of the vehicle.
Many scores in 1-0 win Livingston vs Rangers
First goal Dolly Menga secured win Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower division, came Rangers in the open shield and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga was lucky and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with the Hibernian.
Team Gerrard has not yet won the final in this season’s Premier League and will play against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the European Championship on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the division with six wins, and Holt's head coach has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on opportunities for berthless guests
The Holts team should have been over long before it scored a goal, but their tenacity caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then passed after running through the defensive to receive a shell broadcast from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in silence, knowing that they could cause guests trouble in the right places.
And that’s how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers got a boost and Livingston won in creating a market opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga join, who took the broadcast and scored from the middle of the league.
At that point, the Rangers had ruled over the ball but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to put much effort into it.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped at the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from the goal after a draw from Livingston.
He was fired, and two demands for a whip - after Halkett's defense against alternate Glenn Middleton, and one after him - were dismissed.
"Great" at Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Stunning performance and finals for Livingston.
For the average person, they stood great and continued to live up to all the expectations in their journey.
Their playing style and the team have hardly changed anything since they came back to the top division, but Holt deserved much praise for having punched the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the leader was incredibly good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toe all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's control, they played far below expectations.
They didn't finish their quests and only once managed to open the halfway house so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives mixed receptions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin, the sky was shining and bright.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two NATO nations.
There has been a dispute between them over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a new, giant mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside of Turkey itself.
The police used security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters gathered in its vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced their condemnation of both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to offer him to the country.
The two protest groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a monarch by others.
Accident in Deptford: A cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The attack took place near the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, the main street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and ambulances provided relief, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash took place months after another cyclist died in a collision when a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from the crash site on Saturday.
Police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest relatives know.
Other roads and direct buses have been closed and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Six prisoners were injured when riots broke out in a men's security prison, according to a report from the prison law enforcement agency.
Unrest broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and still raging.
Tornado special forces have been summoned to the area to try to contain the storms, of which eight prisoners are detained, and are only in one alley of the prison.
The guards were apprehended for minor facial injuries on the scene.
A spokesman for the prison law enforcement agency said: “Specially trained detainees have been summoned to handle an incident that is taking place in Long Lartin Prison.
Six workers have been arrested for their injuries.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars and beatings.”
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, riot police were summoned to the scene to deal with a serious disturbance of peace, where staff with billiard balls were attacked.
The Rose Flood threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (dry area might benefit from)
It is uncommon for the warming to pass over Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when the remnants of the Rosa flood pass over the southwest, at the risk of sudden flooding.
The country’s meteorological agency has already issued warnings for flooding ahead of Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with a rainfall.
The Phoenix Meteorological Observatory said on Twitter that “only ten storms have managed to maintain their strength to classify as warming storms or lows in less than 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the country's hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, with a single rainfall of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely to fall 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas in the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of individual falls up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of landing in flash floods, the fallout from Rosa could be a blessing because there are many droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause significant damage, some of this precipitation will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwestern part.
According to the U.S. Drought Control, there is at least a very large drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, but it is the second-highest category," according to weather.com.
First, the Rose Falls will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum wind speeds up to 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels northwards at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific and therefore its power decreases.
As a result, it is expected to land in Mexico as a warming storm on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a considerable risk of flooding.
"A rainfall of 7.5 to 15 cm is expected in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of rainfall," weather.com said in a statement.
Rose will then hold north over Mexico, as a warming storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a warming storm. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected to come from the Rose or its remnants is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert," the country's disaster center said in a statement.
These precipitations are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the deserts, and wetlands.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady”.
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Police have been waiting for witnesses who may have phone records of what happened to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "been able to feel the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote in support of Kavanaugh judges is a vote that rejects the ruthless and derogatory practices of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “started to feel the viciousness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denouncing the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans would have seen the kindness and the humanity and the courage” of Kavanaugh’s day.
“The vote to confirm the Kavanaugh judge is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an elegant career record as a public servant,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“It’s five weeks into one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not going to do it, but I’m really going to do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going through a lot of choices to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were working to “slow down and stop.”
The first key vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is due to take place no later than Friday, according to an aide to Republican leaders in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people have died from earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and the number of deaths is likely to increase
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away by huge waves of skulls on the shores when a major earthquake and flood swept over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-metre-high waves raged on the beach at sunset, washed out a number of people at sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The tidal wave was formed after an earthquake that was 7.5 degrees on Richter.
"When the flooding occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so it killed their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, told an intelligence meeting in Jakarta.
“The tide didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, tree drums, houses, everything that was on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tide had traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers of speed before landing on the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the tidal wave and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air, released by the disaster agency, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, rotating and unused bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake continued to ride across the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was observed in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Food and Technology Foundation of Indonesia said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday would have been about 200 times greater than from the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and winding bay, could have increased the size of the tidal wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the collapse of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the human casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala that is close to the sources of the earthquake.
Communication “is completely down and no information is available” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already become a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The foundation was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting them know that a flood had swept over Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, one could hear a shout from the top floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a flood was approaching.
Just minutes later, the flooding on the beach sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and flooding caused a power outage that hindered communication across Palu and made it difficult for authorities to organize relief work.
The military is beginning to send aircraft with auxiliary supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities to maintain.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the Palu refugee camp on Sunday.
More than 800 people have been killed in floods in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu safely and securely, where they seek refuge in tent cities that were set up in the garden outside their offices. The destruction blew them up on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People say they’ve seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Relief teams have begun difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only begin to arrive if the accident area is declared an emergency area.
It has not been done yet.
“This is still a local accident area,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster zone, we can open up to foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and flood on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, hoped that their loved ones would become one of the miraculous stories that cast hope on the devastating events of the next generation.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from a raft.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian flying team, had been the coach of two missing pilots for the Asians who finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who locked up in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr Gendon said that hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa hotel, he had sent WhatsApp messages in desperation to the competitors staying in Palu and taking part in the beach party.
His messages, however, showed only gray marks, instead of blue.
“I think that meant that the message was not received,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 in ATM Filling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a Brink employee who was filling a Newport on the Levee ATM, according to a news release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had been draining the ATM in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on it, said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in a statement.
While he was at work, another man came “running behind the Brink employee” and stole a purse intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but police did not give up how many were involved in the case.
Those who may have information about the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name - to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: “The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes for his participation in the Saturday Night Live episode where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Arianna Grandi on the show, but she quit for "emotional reasons," the producer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when he was discussing the name on his album with the radio show director Big Boy.
“I’m you, I’m you, I’m you.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye - to being just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has also written his name both with and without tape strikes and strings.
President-elect of Mexico says not to use military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, now the country will soon remember the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful protest march in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were firing roots throughout Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of study opportunities attracted young people to criminals.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it saves in research in this field, says the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks were made after different departments of the U.S. government issued notifications of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal comprehensive program on artificial intelligence.
China, however, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the amount of funding that goes into artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking forward to seeing the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in the world.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, winning the U.S. Best Actor at Othello, and later became CEO of Microsoft Research and chairman of the Chinese division at Google.
Lee talked about previous technical competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Defense Department's Robotics Competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next innovator.
Scientists in the United States often have to put a lot of effort into getting support from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that impresses its most important ideas, it’s companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work with artificial intelligence over the past year.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I think that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s parliament issued its forward-looking agenda in July 2017.
The China Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people working at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars annually in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was intended to create artificial intelligence security councils, has not been going forward for many months.
Macedonians vote in National Vote on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a national vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed their bid to join the EU.
Greece has a region called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a requirement in their territory and therefore denying them entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonian residents of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the ballot and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required so that the ballot is considered valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Will NATO and the EU walk by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote on the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the outcome is not legally binding, enough senators have said they will follow it and bind it into law.
The change of name would require the approval of two-thirds of the House.
The Election Commission said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters paid their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid their vote in the National Vote in Macedonia on whether to change the country's name, but it would make its way into NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Skopje Congress, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov won to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who would ignore the vote.
"We're in awe of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not go through the service door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we live on an erection.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to something else like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says membership of NATO will move the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
“I think the long-term majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the country’s citizens are in the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
He said approval would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Agency showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national vote poll, but that is below the minimum required.
A second poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would say yes.
In order for the national vote to be valid, the attendance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could be the first serious shock to the government’s policy, which is being harassed by the West, since it was adopted in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defense of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with the defense of Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian leader received a transmission in the middle of the estate at the beginning of the parish.
He jumped past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then encircled by four green-clad defenders.
He passed one defender and then ran away from a few in addition to the right at the Brighton side.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forward used the first touch inside the pitch to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, goalkeeper of Brighton, with a shot on the right side of the goal.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, City’s chief executive, told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a consignment far inside the Brighton halves in that parish.
He sent the glorious long balls to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling towards the spring pole.
The City forward sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force another start.
But the fierce Scherzer hope to get to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to reach the final, but they have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division.
The Rockies were given at least a “wildcard” seat with their 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach their first division title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electrified atmosphere in Denver as well as the rest of the team after playing their best game this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to fight in such a situation?”
The Nationals are yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but it is believed that they will have Scherzer thrown under these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting the game for the 34th time, took a practice ball on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his usual Sabbath.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 windmills in 220 2/3 rounds during this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly referred to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“Everything will be fine in November.
It’s five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of those big, big... I don’t offer myself, but I do, so I’m going through a lot of choices to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this awful, radical bunch of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, over whom they have to go to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give them that.
He said the Democrats were working to “shut up and stop.”
"And it's been seen in the last four days," he said, saying Democrats are "angry and evil and cruel and untrue."
He nominated Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ruling Democrat in the Senate Judgment Committee, and was responded with a loud bang from the audience.
“Do you remember her response?
Were you the one who wrote the book?
Ha, what.
No, look, no. I waited for one... it was a really bad show, the worst I've ever seen."
The Church is no longer a clergyman.
He does not tolerate those who express their minds.
When the Activists Momentum in my class chose to give me bullshit, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many members of the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our thoughts.
Joan Ryan, my fellow Member of Parliament, was treated in a similar way because she strongly objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to give me a bully was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were important to have a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, a coldly similar issue, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about it.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want the meetings to understand no outsiders and be effective."
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday’s meetings have been the longest.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “softer and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not lost in the Labour Party and that all views are judged on the basis of whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I previously believed to have similar political views to me, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support views that I had never been in agreement with the EU, regardless of whether it was the case.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a lot of contempt on social media where my departure is called, central politics is denied and I am told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get about me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who have to endure the hollowness of sexual or prejudiced offenses on a daily basis but never quit.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers’ Party should embrace a culture of contempt.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of churches, and with every reluctance or change in electoral rules, the class becomes narrower and narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice for the past two years about letting me carry a little bit, don’t have too much and then I’d be “all right” with me.
I didn’t want to be involved in politics to do that.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my classroom in ruins, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most, whether I was in the city or not.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my devotion to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my only message I would like to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that there will be no threat of deviation or any political disregard for the best.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have breached the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr won in this amusing game of the day in Tennent’s Premiership division.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
Eventually, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious and Peter Murchie coach had full right to be happy.
“We’ve had a tough opposition in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserved praise, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we did,"
Mark Grant Anderson crossed Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned on the quest, but the yellow card on the Scottish team, which was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count and Jason Baggot to score a touchdown.
Climo stepped up to lead Ayr with a wicket before scoring with a kick just before a half-game and then touching a goal and scoring Ayr over 17-5 in a half-game.
But Melrose started the second half with the power and touchpoint of Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the quest, the goal scored by five points.
It took a long game break to cope with Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, and after that Ayr continued to increase his lead with a touchdown goal from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the corner.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's manager, was then awarded the yellow card, and Melrose again used to be a man over with a touch of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough quest.
The homers, however, came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for covering Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr quest, after an extra kick.
Climo reversed the quest, as he did again shortly after the restart, after Kyle Rowe kicked David Amrstrong from the wicket and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
Star Still Game episodes ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game episodes, seems ready to move on to a restaurant show after discovering that he was hired as CEO of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and plays alongside his old entertainment partner, Creg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth installment will be the last and it seems that Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's future.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to say anything about the news, but Scottish Sun said that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in Glasgow's "live restaurant industry".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia’s landlocked country hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the ocean.
It’s our duty to bring it back.”
Across the entire landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline, lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in its freshest memory – along with the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of prosecution.
“Bolivia has the power, the unity and the supremacy, and of course awaits the verdict with positive thoughts,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice in large-scale courts across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant access to the sea to Bolivia, after many decades of agreement.
The verdict on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the country's president of Indian origin, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts find it unlikely that the court would rule in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change little if it did.
The court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no power to cede land from Chile and has ruled that the ruling will not affect the outcome of possible disputes.
The fact that the court’s verdict comes only six months after hearing the final hearings suggests that the case “would not have been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that the past four years have not been a matter for Bolivia to progress, but have caused the country to retreat.
“The current administration of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
Morales’ dictatorship has deprived Chile of all goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks sometime, but it will be enormously difficult after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former president of Bolivia and the country's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a “unique opportunity to open a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139-year-old dispute back in time, for the benefit of both countries,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, would use this issue as a political raise.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The trial is an opportunity to see that we need to make up for the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted by the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the country would never take down its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri made his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow the promises it made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says it's "dreamy" to hold on to continued U.S. trade bans and protests against a declaration on the end of the Korean War will sometime conquer North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes first clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, will meet again at another meeting.
However, there are strong doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Introduce the Latest Line of Large Headwear That Will Come to Fashion Stores Near You
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or stay completely hidden from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased a variety of oversized hats for their SS19 line on the fashion scene that captivated the crowd at the Paris Fashion Week.
A number of photos of extremely unwanted hats have been published on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creative work to showcase at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide bars resembling feathers and covering the heads of the models.
Of other accessories in oversize, watermelon sets of gemstones, sedimentary hat and even pineapple could be seen, but these items are not designed to keep the heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, precisely at the right time for the hamster ride.
Many of the colorful masks were made of composite wool and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-end.
One mask resembled a diving device with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other looked like melting ice in the form of bread.
If you want to customs in fashion, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be on sale in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come with a dose of heels “La Bomba”, a straw hat with over 60cm large bars that has adorned the heads ranging from Rihön to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark behind the extremely unfit hat, which was seen on all social media, was the inspiration for another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene – a straw bag made of straw that was almost the same size as the swimwear model that wore it.
The orange strawberry, with studs and a white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus clothing line at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the people’s stylist, told FEMAIL in an interview: “I expect to see big hats and bags appear in fashion stores for next summer – as the designer has caused such a huge impact, it should be difficult to ignore the demands of follow-up.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland are known for their outstanding student performance and it has continued throughout 2018 with new, elegant test results, which are still reinforced by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other contexts.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further further studies, the career path they have chosen and their status as a citizen.
As a teacher who can compile and teach tailor-made curriculums, we see that new grades continue to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will touch his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can not just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the list with the highest percentage of students who pass exams in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who learned a foreign language received the excellence mark A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received the A score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A score.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will certainly need to maintain in the future.
At the moment, languages, such as electives, are placed in the same place as science-related subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers said it was difficult to hire because of a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require proficiency in languages, this ability is essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if it learns another language, but it is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to have direct communication with people from other countries will automatically give the multilingual character a lead on the competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to sustain conversations, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children of today to invest immediately in language teaching.
Multilingualism, especially in new market countries, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, there is a difference between the schools in what language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on classic nomads, while others will teach languages considered to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future entails.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the global business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern linguistics should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The bid is coming to an end soon for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be longer than one minute and shorter than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After rehearsals earlier this week, James was asked about his schedule for the Lakers' six-game schedule for the start of the season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare,” he said.
Timelines for Trump's election in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of polling sessions and the first will be tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly venues, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump is aiming to increase support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when the votes are paid in November.
What time is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. East Coast Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump is discussing the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, where tensions reigned over allegations of sexual harassment. The Department of Elderly Voting Order to confirm him as a judge was put on trial for up to a week during FBI trial.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans achieve better results, while theirs are awaiting tough elections in November.
That’s why the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters with zeal, the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that they have in the Reuters department.”
“Government of the Senate is so essential to the president’s agenda that he will travel to as many states as possible and another campaign period is already about to begin,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The meeting will be held at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Stadium and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and to be told by Pittsburgh media,” according to the West Virginia Metro News news agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent in this county in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, but he is at the bottom of the polls.
"It's not good news for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive for individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the fourth game, which was on Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this competition for the Ryder Cup.
Swinging in success is a sporting idea that has been invented and in which players believe so truly, and never more than in a competition like this one.
Where would you say your success is now?
“They had six stages ahead and now there are four stages, so the success is rather on our side now, I expect,” Spieth said as he started the race of the day.
Europe is of course at the forefront, four stages ahead with an additional twelve in a row.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have some wind in the sails and they can be hopeful of many, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played great all the way to the flat and leads with his example.
The cheering crowd increased as the circle progressed and he put down an important puddle to shepherd all four stages of the game after he and Thomas had been two stages below after two games.
His puppet, who assured them victory in the game in hole 15, received a similar cheer, shouting from the genre that tells you that he believes that the American team still has no victory.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do right now.
18 holes to win points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but fascinating European pair has won four games out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple to get a blowjob on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid a blowjob on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday, and at the nine-hole court on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from loud spectators clearly shows that they are the pair that need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the National Golf Le sun sets over.
The best option would be to do it both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
A school and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniards and the Swedes into a hole they never managed to scratch out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch next door because of the interactions between the pairs, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how the play schedule can change in a single spot.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable lead for the final day, but this four-game slot also showed that the U.S. team has the fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other U.S. players.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the competition for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after a four-ball and a quarter-final on Saturday, with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, and have scored four points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to win back the prize-winner, who lost to Hazeltine two years ago, showed great superiority over the U.S. team in the morning’s four-ball game and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarter-finals and won two games but failed to earn the scoring.
Team Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who share the nickname "Molliwood" after a wonderful weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great teamwork and defeated Woods and American freshman Bryson Dechambeau 5–4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his ingenuity once, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in quads and quads, including seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was at rest for the morning's four-ball game, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson in the quarter-finals and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place on the list of the world's best golfers.
Europe, however, did not fully benefit from this mild and tasty day southwest of Paris.
The three-time golfer, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the goal for the U.S. by two points on Saturday.
They beat Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in four-ball games and later came back to defeat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four-game after losing their first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won four different points at the start of the individual race, although the team of Furyk only needed an equaliser to continue the cup.
However, after being next in line for two days, it seems that a data breach on Sunday will overwhelm them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament "impossible" without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued trade sanctions only reek of their mistrust of the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to unilaterally lower its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial steps to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, defusing nuclear detonation and nuclear testing.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons unilaterally first.
Although Ri has reiterated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “stage-by-step” approach to nuclear disarmament where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement appeared to be specific in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear weapons.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, where Kim said he would work to "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump issued a pledge to the North Korean government.
North Korea has sought solutions to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must put down its nuclear weapons after all.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax strict trade sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States demands that ‘nuclear disarmament should take place first’ and increase the pressure by using trade bans to achieve its goal, and even protest the declaration of ending the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreamy people who don’t know anything about us who think that a trade ban can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that continued trade bans increase our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, of which the US leader spoke at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead spoke about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea over the past five months, adding: "If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea in place of the United States, the U.S. would not be a pat on the wall.
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the devilish assassination of” President Trump called Kim “a bomber.”
Last year, Trump threatened to "defeat" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim with the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and that trade sanctions would continue to apply until the end of the war.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame in this regard and said, “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s trade ban must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has been confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase trade bans with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to shut down funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying the results had been achieved, but only hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea said it would take down a missile and nuclear power plant if the U.S. takes "corresponding action" at a meeting with Moon this month.
He said Kim had said that the "corresponding actions" he was looking for were security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take classes in a good rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine pills.
A study found that students at the best universities in the world often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it sees the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why is this being told to me only now, in my final year?’
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the fundamentals of how good sleep habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even promote general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of health care at the school, said the university had decided to introduce the course after learning that students were extremely sleepy during the week.
The course is an hour long and involves a variety of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on coffee cups, window curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen with lack of sleep, along with the importance of good routine for children.
In another part, participants are told how a lack of sleep over the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students under the same.
But we feel that they have a right to know this, just as one has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that celebrates those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the increased pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that enough quality sleep is achieved should be a student’s “weapon of choice” to defend against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep increases the brain’s urge to eat so that the body is mentally tired.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and urged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete similar courses before they start studying at university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to bed, and to wake them, and keep in mind the damaging effect of the blue light that electronic displays and LED lights emit, but it can confuse the internal clock of the body to a difficult and difficult path.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots down men Gerrards
The Rangers were still in trouble at the finish line when Stevens Gerrards had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted to score their first win in the final after their win at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave the team Gerrards only their second loss in 18 of his games as CEO. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of halftime and the Rangers team seemed to lack all the inspiration and were never likely to tie.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, while Livingston is in third and are only behind the Hibernian in goalkeeping.
Rangers may face further problems after lineman Calum Spence had to get a head injury injury after some item was thrown into him from the side of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made a breakthrough in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, kept up with the same Livi 11 setup that reached the level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teams rolled over the opposition.
The Rangers were perhaps more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls that it hit.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when the first broadcast from Menga came Scott Pitman ahead of Allan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
Keaghan Jacobs' long extra shots then ended with Craig Halkett, while his defensive partner Alan Lithgow shot past the feather pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than belief in their game in the final quarter of the game.
Alfredo Morales really felt he should have been fired when the quarterback was out of the game, when he and Steven Lawless got together, while Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half but Liam Kelly, former Ibrox goalkeeper, did not have much to defend the skull from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi in the 34th minute had come despite the fact that the other team had passed, no one can deny that they deserved it, not only because of their perseverance.
The Rangers once again failed to do anything from Jacobs's long overhaul.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took the lead in the half and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly and the shifts were impacted nearly as soon as the defender Morelos came in, but Kelly quickly broke through and ran over to close the shot.
Livingston continued to trick the guests into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett each reached the long run on the feet of the other.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the finals, but McGregor was successful in denying Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran to the finish from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' deputy, wanted a second wicket when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson dismissed it again.
The Man Who Invented the Geiger Counter
Here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" journal: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFRAM... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called the Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a permanent place in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What in the world is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s measurement, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to the radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It’s really breaking right now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves removing immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient.
Vaccines at the experimental stage have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer. The cells are then injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is highly effective.”
HER2 "endangers various types of cancer," including cancers of the breast, ovaries, lungs and colon and rectum, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken from patients and ‘known’ to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a single type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a long solo in support of Trump and wore a MAGA deck after appearing on the SNL television show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was filmed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a lengthy speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would bid for president in 2020.
After releasing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great demo, he spoke long against democracies and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve spoken so often to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have long since left the United States,” he said.
SNL began the show with a teaser in which Hollywood star Matt Damon joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the long-running West hasn't been released, the recording was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock would make a joke to West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to viewers that he had received bad receptions from the backstage because of his hoodie.
“I was caught in the backseat.
They said to me, “Don’t go up on the stage with this hose.”
They harassed me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the deep pit?" and said that he would put on his superhero costume, "because that means you can't order me to do anything. Do you want the world to progress?
“Test your love.”
His remarks were met with a buzz from audiences at least twice and SNL actors seemed most embarrassed, according to Variety, and one attendee said to the newspaper, "There was a rock silence in the studio."
West had been invited to replace Arianna Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance as he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, but she said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SEEING THE MULTIPLE OPPOSITION.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “he himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I feel supports and spreads ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that now he was "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and name to Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and can't forget the musical legend Prince the Promised, which changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after knife attack on restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will pass the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of The Crown, criticizes poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent HBO adventure series The Crown.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the stand-up film about the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of male toxicity during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his Crown Actress, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "stronger views" on how to deal with the matter.
"Personally, I feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with manhood?"
“What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the extremely masculine characters in television.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of today – how do we change this?
It’s clear that something has gone wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be playing in any other Coronation episodes after the series resembled next summer, saying that he had received "enough of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play in the re-creation of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these episodes, so they somehow gave me my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow whom Kit played in these Emmy Awards shows.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of the Lesliar family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of nationals infected with the HIV virus or with the disease.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections occurred with sexual intercourse, which is a change from what was before.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to donations of infected blood.
In contrast, the number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way has again fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in the Yunnan region.
However, the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
Sex-induced HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still widespread discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many of these marriages are contagious due to inadequate contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised everyone access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information of three Republican Party senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations came from “superstitious” extremists and websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released online on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill while interviews were being conducted with the Brett Kavanaugh Elderly Division, the Supreme Court’s nominee, on charges of sexual harassment.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Holdings sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP addresses identifying the source of the information connected to Waters’ office and disclosed information about one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and a lie,” Waters continued.
“My employee – whose personal data and security are now at risk due to these false accusations – was in no way responsible for this disclosure.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and a pure lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It’s a sign that she doesn’t have the guts to sit in the Senate.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There can be no opposition.
It should not be questioned on the grounds of the accused.
We need to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh judges, who critics said appeared too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his view on Twitter.
“Great if it’s true,” he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had made “appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials aware of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the culprits are found,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all the deeds that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson’s spy film turns out to be powerful
It has become commonplace now to look for the Brexit references in all new films where Britain comes up with history, and it seems to be true in this revival of the Johnny English comic book series - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and rightly awoke to life again in 2011 with the film John English.
Will this inquisitive satire about how obviously miserable we are be a new export opportunity for the country?
Regardless of whether or not Johnny English has been renewed for a second time to mess up everything - his name shows above all that he is a creative work designed for exhibitions in countries other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the clever secret serviceman who pretends to have fascinating personalities but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the man who played one night for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious citizen Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left everything in disarray.
There are one or two good points in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk on a helicopter dressed as a middle-aged girl and the wings of a helicopter skull in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his ridiculous abilities, but the humor seems rather powerless and oddly superficial, especially now that “serious” movies like James Bond and the Mission Impossible films are also relentlessly joking.
The grin seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and I found the adventures Johnny English landed in not as imaginative and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinson in Mr. Beans’s art.
The only real problem with this film is that the UK is in a lot of trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into a secret spy network in Britain and has come up with the identities of all British spies, to a great extent for the spy on the watch - but that is where Kevin Eldon unfortunately comes in too small a role.
This is the final line for the Prime Minister, who is arrogant and controversial and when in great danger due to huge political hostilities: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a character to remind of Theresa May, but the script is not up to him for many fish.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already settled in the holy stone.
And there comes Johnny English himself to the story, now a schoolmaster at some fine school, but also provides a secret lesson in how to be a spy: here are a few funny jokes English offers a spy school that resembles the film School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long-time partner, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine boss, but in that energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let her light shine.
The spy island that messed up everything in Her Majesty's service is now back in the gear and meets the high-ranking actress Ophelia Bulletov, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is captivated by the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the tech industry, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: it's the evil Jason Volta, the game by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their quest: they light up a fine French restaurant dressed as waiters, they cause a mess as they smuggle themselves into the luxury Volta, and English turns everything back when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with the interior.
There is nothing to be saved in that final item, but although the picture is feathered and energetic, it still contains some of the children's material in it as a whole.
A medium-sized material.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his abilities?
The Labour Party denies that it is making a plan for a four-day working week for the UK, with the same pay as for a five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, the company’s executives want to make use of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and allow employees to benefit from having one extra day off.
Employees could then enjoy three days of long weekends, without decreasing salaries.
Authorities say that the idea would “fit” the group’s economic plan and its policy to improve the interests of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, which has enabled workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A spokesman for the Labour Party’s top division told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“The change will not take place overnight, but the four-day workweek is a goal that fits the class’s approach to transforming economics for the benefit of the workforce and the overall industrial policy of the class.”
The Labour Party would not be the first group to support this idea, but the Green Party promised four days of working week in its 2017 election campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “Four days of working weeks are not on the party’s policy sheet and the party is not considering introducing it.”
John McDonnell, the secretary of commerce of the shadow ministry, used the Labour Party conference last week to describe his ideas of a social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unknown CEOs” and “vegetarians” of donors.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get their full share back, as the Labour Party’s government could “depart” for wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put executives on corporate boards and create a joint-stock fund to leave 10 percent of private equity to their employees, who could get <0xC2><0xA3>500 of that annually in their pockets.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” if the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds
An FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether her findings could be backed by a motion of censure.
In an interview to be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 Minutes episode of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would get them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to the Kavanaugh judge.
I called him after the charges were brought and asked, “Are you doing this?”
He was determined, steadfast, undisputed.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible excuse to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, echoing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those she mentions in her name could not confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the International Day of Citizenship and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of great stars will take place and with a similarly influential strategy; ending poverty around the world.
This is the seventh year that the International City Festival is held and tens of thousands of people will flee to Central Park, not only to listen to music items from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, among others, but also to draw attention to the reality of the secular 20th anniversary celebration.
The International City Day, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, but there are international organizations that want to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concert guests had to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to one of the world’s leaders, calling a few phone calls or using other bins to help out.
But how much success has the festival achieved, already 12 years on the road to achieving the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts in a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just a so-called “smug action” – where people feel it does something that matters by signing up for a krefulista online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, calling for a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped get the world’s leaders to outline commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group counted 390 commitments and announcements due to its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the amount of funds raised so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main liabilities comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and CEO working to “help children enjoy themselves to the full,” and pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country’s global outbreak of malnutrition.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world and international cities like you, we can make the social injustice that malnutrition is a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, 2018 Vice President at The Power.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals were sent that the UK should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach up to 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of frequently asked questions on the group’s website, one question is: “Why do you think you can end up in poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will reach our limits, just like the movements that fought for citizens’ rights and the abolition of racial segregation ahead of us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe will be present at the event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman presenting.
U.S. could use the Navy as an "obstacle" to Russia's energy exports, says Interior Minister
“If necessary,” Washington could use the navy to prevent energy in Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, according to a report from the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially where the country is working with the legitimate government there, would be a proposal to explore a new market.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern part," he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to counteract it.
“The United States can use the navy to ensure that sea routes are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not come to the market,” he said.
Zinke invited guests to the meeting offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less the use of energy supplies and replacing them with others," he said, saying Russia has only one card in its sleeve with an economy that would be dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to lay out new power lines, which Trump says would make Berlin a “Moslem address.”
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Russians say Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to switch from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very dissatisfied with the foreign state sharing our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be “seriously considering” bidding for 2020 presidency, she says
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she would "consider seriously" to run for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering herself at a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and re-establish our government, and then we need a woman as a leader," she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider inviting myself to the presidency.”
Speaking about President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said he was “going in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been swayed by his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by his Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need to have the FBI investigate the case before the vote goes through.”
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren County do not feel that it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “likely” voters said the senator should not bid, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed more support for the supply of former Prime Minister Deval Patrick, with 38 percent saying they support his possible supply and 48 percent saying they are against it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible 2020 presidential nomination were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to reports from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Stroke Disorder at Donald Trump's Election
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel like other families are being affected by the stress disorder and the mental wounds that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told audiences at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, O.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other soldiers "return only differently, they are hardened and wonder if any respect is paid to what their comrades in the army and the air and other divisions of the country have done."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to block a domestic violence report, and gunshots under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 counties and Washington D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen counties and Washington, D.C., have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 counties and the city submitted a court report on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker protesting the policy, according to news from NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband and "his abusive sons who were reciprocals" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The plaintiffs, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where trade-related problems and domestic violence are increasing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new refugee policy revokes a ruling imposed by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
WASHINGTON State Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “scattered decades of state and international law.”
“State law requires that a decision be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court report said.
Lawyers further said in the report that the policy of refusing admission to immigrants was detrimental to the U.S. economy, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and “provided important workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, ordered immigration courts to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and violence against women in June.
“Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular community or political opinion may apply for asylum,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
The fire department was never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead doubles
Things are getting more and more difficult for those who survived.
“There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her weak son at the aid centre in the city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies here all the time.
It’s just a little bit of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes and searching for their water-sauce possessions to try to rescue what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake, which was measured at 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulders, were outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were rushed to outside due to continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the wall ruins, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silenced.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'persecution' with 'grassroots announcements'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual advantages of trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about an advertisement for the Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election that will take place on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections marketed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new step in Washington’s expanding campaign to apply pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to squeeze trade, Beijing and Washington are in a growing trade war, with new tariffs on imported goods from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for a long time, but that state exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad told the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media.”
“By spreading its reputation, the Chinese government is making use of the beloved U.S. free speech agency and our free media by publishing expensive advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in a statement.
“On the other hand, there are few protesters in newspaper outlets on the streets of Beijing, and there is no true reflection of the different views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic policy,” he said.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China has escaped the offer to publish” his article, but he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters cut them off for the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections, because many Republicans have backed and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court, who has settled the allegations of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want to start voting.
“This stuff can’t be backed up,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Jeff Flake, the Republican senator in Arizona, appealed at the last minute for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, spokeswoman for MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" as they protested in the hallways of the Elderly Division when the Republicans who ruled the Judgment Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christ Blacine Ford.
“The electorate’s interest and enthusiasm will rise from all power,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
Analysts predicted a setback if the Republicans pushed to have Kavanaugh confirmed, even for Ford's testimony describing her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party’s national committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the votes of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put in the class, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve handled it,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of the U.S. Semi Board of Directors.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who should believe the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the narrow majority supports the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimonials, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh’s testimonials.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh likely or likely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s appeal, the FBI is now investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judgment Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they both attended a party at Yale University in the 1990s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, plans to set up a startup to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology fairy tale, Inrupt, is a company based on the solid, open Berners-Lee platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do this now,” he said of the company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
There may be a list of contacts, task list, calendar, music library and other personal and work-related devices.
It is similar to having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal abuse of power through the use of data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was purchased by IBM, several applications that were hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
As of this week, tech developers around the world could create their own independent applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team should not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had "the goal of creating energy in businesses and ecosystems that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on Solid."
Berners-Lee switched to the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as he sets up Inrupt.
“I’m full of optimism for the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and holder of the Victorian Cross from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross in World War I as a soldier has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Sir Bernard Vann, who held the position of lieutenant colonel in the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never learned that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his nephews unveiled a memorial to him during a walk in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his affluent sons, said it would be "wonderfully symbolic" that the monument had been unveiled exactly 100 years ago from his grandfather's honor.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through an extremely thick fog and under heavy fire from parachutes and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the line forward before attacking the parachute of his own team and overpowering three soldiers.
He was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his heroic grandfather was "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also performed the flower after the ceremony, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a “great honor to be a part of the show” and added that “the dates of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see Gurru pig
Imagine, having woken up all night to see the overwhelming Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
On the agenda were 13 battles from San Jose, of which six were on the main roster and they were shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5 channel.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received an unexpected incident as the broadcast turned into Gurru Pig.
Some were dissatisfied after waking up all night to watch the fight.
A Twitter fan described the switch to the children's material as "some kind of sick joke."
“According to official rules, the material was not suitable for viewers at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch to children’s material,” Dave Schwartz, deputy director of marketing and communications for Bellator, said in a statement.
"Gurra pork, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would review their schedules and include viewers in the UK in the bill in the future.
“I think when I think about the re-show that we could probably solve this,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning there on Sunday and we can’t resolve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the transmission was switched, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We limited the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and got out of it.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley found 'disease' due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has felt impotence towards other people in his upbringing because of his sexual orientation, but that it has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn’t realize “he was different” until he went to anti-discrimination school.
In the radio show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to provide others with "hope."
He also said that his parenting role has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual director, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Laverne said he thought he was "a lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it wasn't accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of feeling superior and different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The Double Olympic Bronze has made a lot of money as an LGBT supporter and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he felt fortunate to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to provide “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When a man goes through so much at a young age” – but he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it would be difficult to find a peer who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that "all his life views" had been dubious.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
“Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.”
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, at the age of forty, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not agreed that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already gotten their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, diving in front of my audience at home at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also an inspiration to the first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - that had given him inspiration for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and left to sit in the Ryder Cup class on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will score his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he must find his old pace again so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, was placed in the class after the decision of the team Jim Furyk for the competitions in four-ball and four-game on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hassle, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion is split between being a clapper and practicing the acting on the pitch in the hope of correcting what ails him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot targets with the drachmas, and is not the best player for Le Golf National Golf Course, where wanting clumps punish often for bad shots.
And it is not enough that the golf course is a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is in the team with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of these games.
If the Americans, who are four levels below when they take the first game of 12 singles games, get a good start, the game Mickelsons could turn creative.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back and took me out and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and he has been such a great improvement for the teams before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more of it, but that’s how it ended and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup that has never achieved quite as high as any other achievement on his list.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain uncertain impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s cool, he’s funny, he enjoys making jokes about people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to fight him as well this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just golf.”
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of Europe knows that a lot of advances can pass quickly
European team leader Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good lead for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
Danin first played in Valderrama in 1997, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the United States, but managed to claim the final victory with the least possible scoring, with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 wins.
“It’s always remembered that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only that,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-6 on both the day and the day.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
We’ll all be there tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all the steps are on the table.
We have our goal and it is to try to win this cup, we focus on it
I’ve always said that, I’m focused on the 12 players in our team, but we’re very aware of our opponents in the other team – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjorn was thrilled with the way his players had handled the tough times and added: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be all different.
Tomorrow is the performance of the individuals that matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone, you’re trying out all of a person’s skills as a golfer.
It’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now a man leaves his partner and he has to play his best game himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will try to make his players stand better in individual games rather than with teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this great transition in the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brooklyn but ended up losing when Europe performed the “miracle in Medina.”
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, who was in charge in 1999, had encouraged his players to continue for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but one wants to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When the pitcher reaches to build up, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We have sorted our players accordingly and let them play as we think they will do best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover all the way through," Bjorn said of his selection of players in the individual race.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The newest German navy warship should have been built in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it will not be ready until early next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, according to news in the area.
The construction of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leader ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from an army spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be taken advantage of by the navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery plagued the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 are to be replaced by the Bremen class, which have reached their seniority.
They should be equipped with a powerful parachute, many anti-aircraft and ship fire rifles, and concealed technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signals.
Other important features are a longer service life - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant loss means that these newest type of warships - which are said to allow Germany to show its strength at sea - will be already obsolete when they are finally taken advantage, says Die Zeit.
The F125 came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to take the aisle and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of many women seriously "deficient in software and hardware" that made the warship useless if it was sent to war.
Software shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class warship will be commanded by 120 crew members, which is half the size of the Bremen class warships.
It was also revealed that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make additions to it in the future.
The 7,000 ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship is believed to be twice the weight of a similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from hardware flaws, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the project - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but was originally expected to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems afflicting the latest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that the superiority of the Germans in the sea is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was in fact being "split with a capable ship."
The representative said that the problem had been solved over time, because older ships were decommissioned but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the orders of the Baden-Württemberg class could be put into use by the navy.
The National Trust Nature Conservation Association spies on the secret life of leather jackets
A new study, carried out on land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how leatherworms use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation measures.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of leather blocks in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Specific recording devices will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather skins over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on surveillance trips with handheld sensors.
Experts will analyze all recordings to find out the frequency of callers, which the leather blocks emit, and what types do what.
A map of the habitats and a report will then be issued to create an accurate picture of their behavior on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s Night Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal what types of habitats are most important for the leather blocks and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forestry for leatherworms and other related species.
Leather blocks have declined considerably in the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk due to construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce livelihoods.
Windmills and lights can also pose a risk, including flying paper and certain chemical handling of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Skin patches are actually not blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to urgent hunting, because they are used to hunt at night.
They use advanced rock-measuring techniques to find insects and objects that are on their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes leather blocks very seriously.
The organizations employ ten experts, who carry out regular inspections, quarry inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland's first and only leather-blood conservation area at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten leather-blood conservation species have their homes.
David Thompson, the farm’s manager, says he’s the perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for leather patches,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of grown trees and lots of good livelihoods.
But there’s still a lot of unconsciousness about skin patches, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to clean up.”
He emphasized the importance of checking with leather blocks before maintenance takes place in dwellings, where the possible unintentional destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 female and young leather blocks and destroy all leather blocks in the area.
Leather blocks are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot of unlearned about leather patches and we don’t know how well many of their species are doing.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, lawyers prepare prosecution against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations against him of rape "fake news" and said people want to "catch attention" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping a woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news," the world champion told the camera five times.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called “an unacceptable disclosure of privacy suspicions,” according to the Reuters news agency.
Attorney Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would claim compensation for “a conspiracy of the same amount and severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After watching the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the anus, according to documents filed before the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after an outrageous incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good man" who was tempted by "1 percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo has agreed that the couple had sex, but that it was with the consent of both.
Mayorga says she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but finally accepted a bailout because she was "deadly afraid of retaliation" and worried about becoming "publicly humiliated."
She says she's going to quit because she's still in shock after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due to take place, and last summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would "see after forever" to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “see forever” if it lost its position as a global leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, said Minister of Commerce Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK moved out of the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily shut down its production facility in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of leaving the borders if a no-deal Brexit became reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production facilities in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have voiced concerns about exiting the EU without approval on how to conduct cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns lie in what automakers say is a supply chain risk if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on a “last minute” reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars produced on-demand.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions to the borders that the industry believes could lead to waste and spare parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day’s worth of storage at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan for Theresa May’s future relationship with the EU “was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the borders.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only the success of the present, but as an opportunity that we can use,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue with highly successful acquisitions.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the Workers’ Society at the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred again for a week" now that the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by the Supreme Court, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian electoral disputes, the connections between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the president.
For weeks, stories have been going on in Washington about whether Trump will run an assistant state prosecutor and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overturning the president by using the 25th additional paragraph of the executive order.
Rosenstein denied these allegations.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, among the news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed so he wouldn't be at the same time as hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have sued him for sexual harassment, were wise.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which postponed the Senate Department’s vote further.
Sarah Sander, Trump's spokeswoman, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date set for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be postponed another week because of anything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we do, and I’m always happy to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the director of the show, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with television reporters being “imaginary,” but she said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they are virtual.”
She then gave indications that the direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more media questions than any other president has ever asked,” she said, without referring to the source: “We have gone over these numbers.”
Sanders said, “If the media have a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do a lot of it, and you’ve seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks, and that’s going to replace media meetings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are uncommon.
The president may have shown the reason for this in New York this week, when he showed unhindered and at times odd behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff within Scotland's health system over concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to staff from the EU working within the Health System in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the gratitude of the nation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of the UK leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to meet the costs of applying for a work permit for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, talks between the UK and the EU over the verdict have continued and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The British government has also worked on the preparations if there is no agreement.
I know this must be a great time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate how much I value the work of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare and benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to news from Mike Organ, a Tennessean journalist.
Tennessee State Supercoach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had come shortly before the game.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Coaches and ambulances gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before he was put on a carrier and carried out for a closer inspection.
A Tennessee State spokesman for WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, Chris Harris said Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information on the type or severity of the accident yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in high school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five cops on Saturday before he left, which increased the total number of cops with him to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK. Excess will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plan of the Conservative Party
The action will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The government plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy real estate in the UK. Excess will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The action will be considered an attempt to make no success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at affordable prices and taxing high-profile people more.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp fees, and the surplus will go to the actions of the government to help the homeless.
The increase - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase imposed two years ago on ancillary housing and real estate purchases for rent - could be up to three percent.
The U.S. Treasury estimates that the increase will be up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new buildings are bought by foreigners, which causes price hikes and makes it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many industrialized areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become “mineral cities” due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp fees to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to stop quoting homes at affordable prices to fix Britain’s “residential shame.”
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant renovations in housing matters, including a lease inspection and the end of the lease-out without charge.
He also wants to give the government more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that involves repairing our unused real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is equally easy for foreign parties and companies with head offices abroad to buy homes and for competent British nationals.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Jack Ross, coach of Sunderland, says it's his "greatest goal" to become Scotland's coach of all time.
This 42-year-old Scottie is now taking on the challenge of bringing new life to the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the first division, three levels from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got injured on my knee and that was the end of it," Ross told Sportsound in an interview with BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I succeeded in training the team.”
Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic club coach said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As I am, I am going to measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is undoubtedly at home in the Premier League due to its structure and facilities," he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I would probably only see myself as a success here if I came back to the club up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the coaching team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall into the division, into a division champion the following season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real match,” he says of the period when he became Alloa’s coach.
“I really believed that the coaching job was good for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds strange, because I did well, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed a moral success.
However, changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot each week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching job just seems right for me.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better about myself in all my adult years.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
The heatwave this summer has proved to be beneficial for British bars in Basle, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which summarized the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when sales rose by 2.8 percent, except for what it offered.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which focus mainly on the sale of drinks, stood for a long time with more bulging while restaurants went down.
Pubs that sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
The sale of drinks at pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while the dining room decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman, from the RSM analysis firm, said: “These findings are a continuation of the swing we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling at non-domestic markets.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still in difficulty, although a decrease in sales of up to 4.8 per cent between months is particularly painful above the continued pressure of costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for a restaurant and only time will reveal whether tempered temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the pace of the openings.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, all under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the survey’s findings.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the number of “smart Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “principal” account they show their parents
One in five children, all under the age of 11, create secret social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed a large increase in “Gervi Insta” accounts – which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a pure “main” account to show their parents, as well as having secret accounts.
A mother who stumbled onto the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, found that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'the voice of athletes' in Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive chairman at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful freestyle athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect within the sports community in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money getting her on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of the athletes and I hope that I can make my mark and help drive the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who won, among others, the 200-m and 400-m Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, but has a total of four Olympic medals, and now a regular visitor to the BBC, became paralyzed after a short-lived stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I had recovered and then to what extent.
This has been a hard job but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising, comparing mothers with cows, causes online dispute
A company that produces breast pumps is now being talked about online because of advertisements carried by lactating mothers to lactating cows.
The company Elvie has released a whimsical ad to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be worn outside”. The ad is inspired by music videos and is intended to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are pregnant.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of heyu and cows to a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail on me" and "If you didn't notice it, it's not the yug, it's my breasts."
“Pump, pump, I’m feeding the kids, pump, pump, I’m pumping milk from Christmas.”
However, the ad, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
The video, with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received uneven reactions from viewers, who say that it has become obsessed with the “grill” that accompanies the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they need to become calves and carry to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born," he said in one comment.

Another viewer wrote: “It’s very difficult for both the mother and the child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their children?”
Another added: “This ad is completely out of step with time.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that the song's features were "funny."
“I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought this if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s a great idea,” one of the audience wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun ad that’s directed at mothers pumping milk (often at work or inside the toilet) and feels like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump milk out of them.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and fits comfortably above the bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold on to their baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and chief executive, said: “The Elvie pumpkin is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a prominent presentation that would spark controversy.
By mimicking women as cows, we wanted to direct the spotlight to the breast pump and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how great a sense of freedom the new pump would provide.
This isn’t the first time Elvis has been in the news.
At a fashion week in London, a mother of two showed up at a fashion show for designer Morta Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Silently Moved to Texas Border Camp
The number of immigrant children in detention has risen sharply even though the number of those crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that harsh rhetoric and policies that the Trump administration has put forward have made it harder to deal with.
Typically, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to put their chances of staying in the country at risk, by offering to nurture a child.
The risk increased in June, when authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the household would have to submit a fingerprint, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigration and Customs Surveillance, testified in front of the Elderly Division, saying his organization had arrested a number of people who applied to raise single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on file.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster homes are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are illegal immigrants on record.
“So we continue to look for their individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In an attempt to work faster on children’s issues, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criterion, according to the staff working in a custody.
Many of them will meet through video conferencing, rather than in their own person, to present arguments for their legal status before a magistrate in immigration matters.
Those children who are convicted of not being able to enter the country are immediately dispatched from the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or refugee attempts, according to shelter staff and reports released by the system in recent months.
Proponents said these problems were even more likely in a larger institution like Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that although the child is not difficult, because of how many they are.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could add to the shock that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish military teams should withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign military was illegal in Syria, on the false presumption that they were fighting terrorism, and that "they would be treated accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the House.
Moualem said the "war on terror pain is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this holy struggle until we clear all Syrian areas” of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As far as refugee issues are concerned, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return, and he taught "some Western countries" to "spread unreasonable fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re making politics out of something that should be just a humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations says a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral zone at the last major anti-government stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the three-million-strong province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and said he hoped that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda, and that they would be "extinct."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN ambassador, hopes to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to negotiate a post-war government for Syria and pay the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "exceeding the provisions of the current government," and warned of all interference.
Reasons Trump Will Win a Second Election
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
That would be the most dramatic end to the president’s career ever!”
At the same time, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
As of 2014, best-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked with up to 3.5 million viewers on critical news evenings.
“It’s a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, ABC’s director of “Designated Survivor,” said of a government employee who will become president after the House is destroyed in an attack.

He could not wear himself out, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to testify before the Judicial Committee of the Elders and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were creating all these crazy elements in the old days and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.”

Money Outside the Flow in the Most Famous Elections of the Middle Ages
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th Electoral District is seeing the money flow to it, thanks to the reorganisation of polling stations that led to two delegates competing for the same seat.
The reorganised Pittsburg area sends Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his second seat in the special election last summer.
Lamb is facing another Republican, Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the old 12th Electoral District in Pennsylvania, who has a lot to do with the new 17th Electoral District.
The maps of the constituencies were reorganised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old constituencies were organized for the benefit of the republicans and that it violated the constitution.
The race for the new 17th Electoral Region has been the start of a competition to finance electoral campaigns between the main funding actors of both categories, the Democratic Central Committee (DCCC) and the Central Committee of the Republicans (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for the 18th constituency in Pennsylvania, with many following that election.
Republicans had previously heated it for more than a decade and Donald Trump, the president, won the polling station by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a bit of an edge.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support to China, but then withdrew.
The emperors noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners of the Trump coalition’s racquet management team left.
Foreign ministry representatives decided to recall the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “a recent decision not to recognize Tavan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug control, development work, and economic support.
The sanctions, which included, among other things, a cut in financial support and restrictions on the issuance of residence permits, would have been painful for Central America, where there is high unemployment and high homicide rates.
After the in-house meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed the conference on security and economic success and were expected to follow a similar meeting held in the past, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the U.S.
But in mid-September, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and consequently ended all negligence about punishments against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now calling for the conference to be held in mid-October, a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the Foreign Ministers said.
The three U.S. envoys also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to discuss in detail the discussions described by the three U.S. delegates, including two foreign ministers, who agreed to discuss the in-house arguments against becoming anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the government and also spoke about the case against anonymity.
Learn the story.
The next scandal case could be a report by Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor, on Mr Trump’s possible actions to obstruct justice, but for that accusation there is multiple public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s election campaign has won with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the House is governed by a different party, Trump may have to be held accountable for it, as he prepares to meet his constituents again, and possibly a bench appointed by his peers.
However, these are extremely uncertain and I do not want to argue that the fall of Trump is unquestionable, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to plunder Hitler, only if Western countries had given him resistance and support to the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the calamity that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and speeds up or delays the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The U.S. is facing a number of such important points right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein, the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this newspaper reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was incompetent in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not right.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect a mid-term senator who will let Mr Trump take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, the democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don’t think we’re going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as she had been in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the crowbar.
With such a legacy, how can I but look positively at our future?”

Graham Dorrans, a member of the Rangers, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the European Cup G-group. Rangers made a magnificent draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season before the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2–2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use those results as a jumper for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have claimed victory in the end, but overall the tie was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we got stronger in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important day for the European Championships.
Hopefully we can reach three levels but it will be a difficult game because they did well in their last game. But with the audience who support us, I am sure that we will succeed and get a positive result.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the site.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their retirement savings
Although the respondents in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term education.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want family members to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, deputy head of the Nationwide Life Insurance Division.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not give them your wishes light in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved in the matter: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term education are traditional life insurance with long-term education, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-assurance with your own money – as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a health education supervisor so that you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your health education and make sure that health professionals do what you want if you can’t tell them directly.
Also consider getting a procuring agent for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother lands in an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please provide this information in a written plan so that you are ready for it.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“Who are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Be prepared for that plan.”
A man shot multiple times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun when he was on his way home on foot after being outside to have fun.
The victim is a 50-year-old man who was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which took place at about 02.30 a.m. local time in Britain, as a "random attack."
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not injured and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and flooding in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death toll will rise.
Since all communications are down, aid workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and is closer to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 at Richter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Palu after the accident.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and flooding hit the city.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is the administrative area under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, but they are mostly in Morowali, which is on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Floods have plagued Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian disaster agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the floods and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
There will also be a flood in the western part of Donggala in 1996, where nine people died.
Indonesia sits on the active volcano of the Pacific Ocean and there are regular earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Aceh region in the north of Sumatra struck on 26 December, triggering flooding in 14 countries and killing 226,000 people across the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes swept across the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit Richter's southern Judea, Indonesia's most populous island, causing flooding on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake struck at 7.6 on Richter's crossing of the city of Padang, which is the capital of the province in the western part of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit Richter on one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and caused up to 10-metre-high tidal waves that devastated a number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The grounds of an earthquake wreaked havoc over Pidie Jaya County in Aceh and caused devastation and terror as people commemorate the devastation in the deadly earthquake and flood of 2004.
No flooding occurred this time, but over 100 dead lives are building collapses.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Saruh Palin, a former Alaskan governor and presidential senator, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to block a domestic violence report and stressing arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police released on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin picked up a phone call from her friend as she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station where he is awaiting trial, and he is being held against $500 bail, according to news from KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty, not guilty" when asked to declare his guilt or innocence, according to the news agency.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and required to pay $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with Category B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing a domestic violence report and carrying a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend insists that he stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by rebel groups in 2016 after she taught shock shocks about her son’s violent behavior after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter, triggered a flood and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are at a low level and it is expected that the number of speakers will increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred just off the centre of Sulawesi Island, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing when the event took place are now being circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach holiday in the city of Palu when the floods hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which left eight people dead. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of state laws since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He also down there walking and cycling road passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victim’s eight victims “voluntarily” and inflicted serious bodily harm “voluntarily”, according to the will-to-implement statement on the death penalty, which was registered in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges may lead to possible death sentences, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecution in charges against organized crime organizations. Saipov's charge was also prosecuted and prosecuted.
The attack included “a massive planned plot,” the defendants said, describing Sapiov’s actions as “terrible, cruel, and immoral.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was the cause of bodily injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last took the death penalty for treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers and sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in a New York court case in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were killed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to request the death penalty instead of adopting a life sentence against imprisonment without the possibility of an experiential solution will only prolong the shock caused by this event for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be conducting negotiations over Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the people’s army” today in protest at a congress of the Conservatives.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should be "pressured" by EU doubters, while one of May's senators suggested he should lead the negotiation with the EU.
Detainee Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that the UK would have “goed out” now if Farage were the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge that May faces to settle a deep dispute between her own teammates was even better revealed by the fact that the conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is under criticism from those who are struggling with Brexit, those who are anti-EU, and the EU.
Allies said she would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those who are anti-Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and "disorder".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to “resolve the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given responsibility and responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in the office, we would be out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone pointed out the evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public has changed their minds and wants to remain silent is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a persistent Brexit supporter, was also in the protest rally and told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular with the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys the unpopularity among our classmates and activists who are on the streets and vote for us.
Do that, stop the Chequers program and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said that politicians would have to be “pressured” if they were to give in to the decision taken following the 2016 ballot.
“It’s about trust between us – the people – and our political party,” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we are here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you come up with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about to betray before Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are building an army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, supporters held an EU protest march in Birmingham that ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the flag of conservatives against Brexit after the group was set up over the weekend.
Adonis Lavar<0xC3><0xB0>ur, from the Labour Party, joked to the conservatives about security issues that came up in the party's phone app when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that it can have all computer systems in order and all technology for Canada plus plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“It’s a total shock.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to "consider seriously" to bid for the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator, says she plans to "seriously consider the availability of the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a city council meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized US President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of curiosity that she could offer herself against Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a citizen meeting with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she had any plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and govern our government, and then we also need a woman as a leader.”
Arrest after deadly shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the person seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and died from it,” Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told media on Saturday, according to news from 247sports.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to having been on the scene, with a gun in his forearms, and confessed to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was apprehended and detained by the Baton Rouge East Police Department.
The Sims was two meters tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, He played in 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel grants him the victory after being ordered by their team.
It was obvious from the time that Valtteri Bottas got a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the start on Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got a good start at the start and left Hamilton almost after he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vettel went first in the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to score.
The Mercedes went into the pit one round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a serious clash in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside after being in danger of being left behind, after defensive attempts in the third corner.
Max Verstappen was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen to reach fourth place.
He eventually went into the pit in the 44th round but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, and Raikkonen took the fourth place.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri stood beautifully all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out.
The team has stood great to achieve this achievement," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body image.
U.S. President Donald Trump mocked Senate Elder Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her allegations that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judgment Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and uncertain."
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the senior ward, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and cruel and untrue,” he said.
“When you see the papers and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do this?
You remember after her answer... you closed the document - "Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Now wait a little slow.
"No, we're not," he said, staring at the old man.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, revealing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t cover her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I did as she asked me to do.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, this was a really bad show.
Maybe she doesn’t cover anything, but this was the worst body show I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and insisted that Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
“They are determined to get back to power, no matter what methods they have to use.
You see the cruelty, the evil, no matter who they hurt, who they have to choose over to take power and control," the president said, according to news from the Mediaite.
Elite League division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars added their loss on Friday in the Elite League division against the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were ahead of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the natives, but Dwyer then crossed the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard won for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe in the Elite League division, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams in the season, and the Giants had won the games three times before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3.35, after a supporter from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a supporter when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
It was then a lot to be in the first minutes and Sullivan returned home to the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then normalized after a support broadcast from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer managed to pass the Giants for halftime when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first quarter.
The team recovered and Bouchard recovered after a goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second game.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen cross Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he assured his team a fifth win when half of the last quarter was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board plane escape from earthquake <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he lost his life ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tidal wave.
Large aftershocks continue to devastate the area and many are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the control tower that swinged violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was about to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could certainly make it into the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very saddened to hear this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed a thousand, as the country's disaster agency says access is limited to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of deaths is on the rise because many bodies are still in ruins and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre-high waves have wreaked havoc in Palu, where a multi-day event will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft are working to provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a corpse.
There is little about clean water.
“Small markets have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the international Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to find survivors but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the removal.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one is missing after plane crashes into a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline, which owned a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon it was not aware of the departure of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Police said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon a dose ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a U.S. passenger, said the plane's arrival had been extremely low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wait deep in the water and reach emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said the pilots had been frightened and screaming and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers who were at work a short distance from setting up a dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflated boat to ferry people ashore, before the plane sank about 30 meters deep.
Data from the Air Safety Agency shows that 111 people have died in the PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the last two decades, but none of them related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening that a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a reopening of a case against a man accused of burning down a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert at the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for many hours as an expert in the field of intelligence.
He then described to the district court how he used mobile records to comb the journeys of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night of her death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to news from The Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He destroyed her from her life,” Hale said.
Defenders are expected to deliver their finals on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before the court later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to fight against negative opinions about the music start date by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has removed its origins as it contained a political message and dealt with social issues.
They want to look for the origins again and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent upsurge in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black man?!
A New York-based woman prosecutes a couple for breaking up after ‘condemned’ text message
A New York-based babysitter sues a married couple for illegally misrepresenting herself after receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and likens the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that her new fetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NEEEEEIII OTHER BLACK HUMAN" Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Ms. Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, the "shameful" Plasco-Flaxman rejected Ms. Maurice and said that their former foetus, who was dark, had been in a bad position, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to news from the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one of her workdays and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is now prosecuting the couple and wants to receive compensation for her divorce, amounting to $350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been hired for, though no contract has been signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s the difference.”
The couple have objected to the allegations of being prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to fire Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent me a message that I didn’t want to tell her.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But who would trust their children to someone after having shown that kindness, even if it was a surprise?
A newborn child? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Don't act like that."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion,” saying his wife had been in jail for seven months and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It’s not very nicely done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment manager.
The case is still pending, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and shamed them for their behavior and discourse.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book’s approval, said of the letter: “It’s hard to follow in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said that her father, who worked as a filmmaker for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had accepted the rejection of his work with a quieter positive, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "afternoon."
As for Paddington, who she describes as a "very important family member," she added that her father had shown a low-key pride in his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and he wasn’t used to mounting himself,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something. You’re proud of it even if you haven’t done anything yourself.
I think he has somehow looked at Paddington’s success in this way.
Although Paddington was his creative work and imagination, he always gave Paddington his own honor.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs, which the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up, were gradually losing their activity and excreting from the body.
She had died shortly before and this was the body to give up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all going to happen.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to take control of myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she had experienced.
“No one knew anything,” she said.
“I lost my head and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Hang Messages to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women, who had loved ones who committed suicide, are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I need to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could illuminate any room."
He stopped working before he died, because he was “sucked down into a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it will be a consequence."
Ms. Davis urged the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit there and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her husband to 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say anything about being sick or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was up at his worst on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death would be a great shock to them, but that they would have to make up for it: “This is ripping a hole in the family.
This is tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with a limited time and scope - we might get a little bit of agreement," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be "divided into two sides."
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the case?
It’s because of the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, the 6th of November. If the Republicans go badly, as expected, it seriously weakens their attempts to get their husband elected to sit in the country's supreme court.
George W. Bush has been calling senior senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, but she was Mr. Bush's sole proprietor.
What will happen after the FBI releases its investigation report?
The meeting will be held at the House of Representatives, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit as of today.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the equation and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of people fleeing North Korea "decreases" under Kim's rule
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean senator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the South Korean Unification Council, said 1,127 people had fled the previous year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border warnings between North Korea and China and higher charges imposed by smuggling people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest borders that lie to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them rather than the well-protected neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Communications between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have technically improved considerably in the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused mainly on postponed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in rough terms to work together towards the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told U.S. businessmen about the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first," he said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "motherly ill" and says he is unfit to serve as Supreme Court Justice
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by the Supreme Court, a "mother's disease" and said he was too emboldened to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped these words in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever died like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Elders’ Judgment Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes nearly shouted it up and got a kick in the throat when he talked to his family and his school year.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations at his hands a “ugly and organized murder of reputation” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work with the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was partial to Democrats.
"I think these allegations and how he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats show that he is incapable of the job," she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he was confirmed and if Democrats reached a majority in Congress.
“If he’s not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at the appeals court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade Abortion Act, in which he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say ‘a lot of it’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
These are just words, months and years of hatred flowing out of her, and she does not leave without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere and said that she cried too when she was angry, but she had developed technology with her so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interlocutor, ‘I think you can.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept on crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest recollections of my previous job I was doing in the office with mostly men, where I started crying out of anger that I couldn’t express, an older woman came and took the kneecap on me. She was a cold boss that I had always been afraid to step in a little bit.
“Don’t ever let me see you cry,” she said.
They don't know you're a bully.
They think you’re dumb and they’re happy to have reached you.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was president, but she was then a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was seized with a glow-in-the-dark bypass on board a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew its supply, Ms. Schroeder, full of bitterness, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider proposing herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said, laughing at me, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they had to hold was one more.
It was called "The White Swan and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the election campaign was far from over, she was behind in terms of bankruptcy, so she promised not to offer herself unless she was able to collect 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1000 to the men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she wondered.
When she made her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise funds and direct her sea to the electorate, and instead to the electorate.
"I could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, who recalls how the media reacted.
“Kleenex could have been my supporter.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my stone?
"She's crying?"
China-U.S. trade war could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were devastating, and although the war is far from over, the gap between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning shot earlier this year by levying taxes on China's main exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest scaling came this week with new tariffs covering goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing nearly half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin each time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to U.S. tariffs, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will run out of time.
To get Washington to jump is to avoid demands, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president, to publicly bow down to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing keeps up the game, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run, by reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
“The fact that a swift political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to the conditions leading to economic collapse in either country, is actually much more dangerous than viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an American researcher who specializes in the study.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Secretary of State Walid al Moualem spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on earth is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to come under normal circumstances by building up areas that were devastated by the terrorists’ activities.
All is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic decisions that targeted their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million, who still live in the country, are in need of assistance to sustain.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept assistance to rebuild the country.
He stressed, however, that they would not accept assistance subject to conditions or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European titles and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points it took to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulty in the entire race, hit his starting pitch in the water on hole 16, which is pair 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari scored brilliantly in all of his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the competition began using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the bottom position in the European team rankings.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who played possibly in his last Ryder Cup match.
Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times in the Ryder Cup, became the winner of the competition with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so thankful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have the cup again.
It’s all about the team, and it was a pleasure to be able to help,” Garcia said after a European victory.
He defeated his country's John Rahm, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup race.
This is an odd result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding themselves on the pitch all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. forward Jim Furyk said after his disappointment with his team's performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take Thomas downstairs.
He is a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the United States and name the Ryder Cup and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their leader.
You have to get up.
“They played better than me.”
