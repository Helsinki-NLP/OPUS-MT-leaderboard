Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has rejected today the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the ex-prime minister's release, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet firm, the appeals court is obliged to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The Victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to be determined who the winner is.
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is all about clarifying whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off from their hands.
Women can already go forgetting to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, the society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established which we cannot imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not without surprise that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When we look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantee of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to make Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it may not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as Sharia supporters don't cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe go on a hunt for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquartile period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and, according to <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>, the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is shaped.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main Events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest rate on their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest rates on Czech ten-year bonds remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany, there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the qualifying with a 200 million premium.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so there will be no shortage of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the downfall of the local team towards the final, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won 1–0 in Montenegro and celebrate their pass to the European Championship.
Due to the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so the national football boxes will receive a reward of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were only committed to maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray Tuesday at noon in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center that works with uranium in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of Isfahan’s nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralysing Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli sources said, not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it grows for the healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children are fed, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the “Obesity is not a coincidence” prevention program.
In families of overweight children there is no habit of doing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 elementary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day on a diet: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey’s findings says.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, the details, which also count, are important, such as having a fixed time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households you don’t have breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet refreshments daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your own diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“The popularity of sweet soda is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main food, the pasta is carried by the palm and the poultry meat is followed closely.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after completing the ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’ prevention program, there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of healthy eating,” the study’s findings point out.
Pay attention, for example, to sweet soft drinks, where many children would start to prefer normal and flowing water.
Children would also more often choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet foods and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of show.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (there is no man in the course) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-shouldered, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist should be able to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves.
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not to dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants don’t fit, it’s worth getting yourself sewn at least one extra piece of custom fabric.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many kinds of various information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous ones, to whom you will have to design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've been "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Screaming from the inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently will have fattened a hundred kilos (please note the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
The dresses we have to cut them from magazines or search them on the internet and print them, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, as it is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (on specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All of this was told by designer and stylist Mario Kameník.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three guest specialists animated the conference on Saturday with information on all types of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is fundamental in this case.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed classically with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just take it off and raise your neck to get a completely different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that image and style alone represent, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketplace have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that they are very likely to tell us a size very different from their actual (minor).
Then it remains only to peek and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not only oriented in fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you met, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her dressing room and complete it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw away everything and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
“Find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
There are also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clamps for attaching garments to the front, if it was larger (pins and other types of attachments are not allowed, as they could damage the weave.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole and much more the exterior could be damaged.
And we did nothing but dress up and dress up.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to accidentally damage them.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling on a professional level is not a path of roses, but I do not care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Resenya
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of inappropriate neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent, expectations were met, but this is useless if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused high expectations even before its release.
It promised to give new air to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what is shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action again without more.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total computation points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, errors cannot be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible failure of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
He introduces you to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to take part in an illegal race across America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
From this it follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to previous series deliveries.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a required number of opponents (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel), and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes appears the police, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than one might expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true of collisions.
From games of this type you can not expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that when making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
It even ends up completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you have an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available for each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is only a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, even resetting does not help, it only helps to learn the given memory stage.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see two cars going in opposite directions, your opponent goes ahead without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be ahead of the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at whatever price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can pamper the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because even if the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit is taking the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so it doesn’t fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline suppliers next to the road, because right there you have to change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you will be enough what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supersports for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main narrative thread, a parallel challenge thread also appears, that is, there are races in specific places that you will get to know through the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both the challenges and the stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver has several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you arrive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the convoy of the metro and takes you ahead without more.
In the editorial we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or whether the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport spotlights.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativity and euroscepticism.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a barracks."
"It will take five, six years before the situation stabilizes a little bit, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take seriously his motto "clear and open about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenova also discussed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“First comes the criticism, that if he’s insensitive, he’s a grey official, able to take on any role, but I have to say he left everyone confused, because he takes on his roles perfectly.”
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union for states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good turmoil", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the seven-year budget of the EU, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which countries will receive less support? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
“The truth is that I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms or jargon that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us the Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speed awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for euroscepticism and people perceive the negative rather than the positive.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies in a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What, have you left, those of the Visegrad Group?'
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new one of "the European Federation".
"We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone."
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the two-speed Europe," Vicenová said.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be debated among member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM starts its second century
If someone were to look for a term that would accurately define IBM’s strategy, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis for this long-lasting character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
Already he coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully erected corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of changes around.
This has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, current CEO of the company.
A Sophisticated System
Watson, as early as the 1930s, took care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Bata in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated compensation system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the customer relationship.
From the very beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years, where she has been Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, a rain of ideas online, from which a myriad of future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that there are more ideas, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology enterprise,” says Harvard Business School economist Rosabeth Moss Kanter, author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM – or the “Great Green” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both computers and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all U.S. tech companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are ATMs, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year, IBM has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on advancing, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past,” acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about one-fifth is of programs and another-fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990, the equipment accounted for more than half of the supplier’s share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets totalling $15 billion, and over the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM operates on the assumptions of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression of the 29th increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratosphericly to 120%, the company’s net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
One can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - it was originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He possessed inventions such as the famous "touch clock", which allows him to control the incoming and outgoing of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a competition company, to help him manage the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and began the company’s great expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pieces", which established the computer standard of the time, came to the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer full advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e., “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire trading cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her mistress, Darina still had hopes that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can go home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtárová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové to her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepting her husband's relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
And Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife lies with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my beloved and old boric who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," said Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová, adding that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far, Josef doesn't care that his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
“The company is still in place, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.”
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not resist.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she’s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Josef concludes.
Women’s worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical female vices, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of the men?
Go shopping.
Are you reproaching your mid-orange for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one bag a week?
Do you like to shop often at auctions?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But look, what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores without further ado, look for tight-fitting clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner to wait for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
“Would I need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an infinite thief.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a newly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In the event that you suffer this “deviation,” try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness certainly should not occupy being paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Used panties are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow, too."
"The wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you do those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women are also affected by slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
At best, each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jagr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part on Monday in the NHL match with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and puts the Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star’s move, and took a step further and was declared the best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jagr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the game, I told him I was going to make a triplet."
“I introduced him.”
"Sometimes they look like ambush," Jágr explained, after Giroux scored his performance, following the Flyers' first draw.
A while later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech footprint.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek made the record behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot collided with Wayne Simmonds' quarter-final goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t mean to say he’s the best player on the court, but he’s definitely in the top three,” Jágr told his team.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with an athlete like him.”
"I'm very pleased with that."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,” Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's again, a penalty shootout, until he got to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow further complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He dumped the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he experienced it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury in the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
“Okay, but there’s nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much to rotate the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc out of our field."
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
The goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions from Winnipeg in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who ended a series of defeats that lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of the time sold travel in most cases only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend the night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
But not everything was earned.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.
The way the Czechs travelled has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was not going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that the currently favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European states was imposed, causing a huge surge of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned food, sausages, etc.) with you to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also the average wages, which caused an increase in demand for travel around 1997.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, starting in 1997, to regularly prepare trips using charter flights connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of getting discounts on the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, the Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights depart every year with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries. This winter you will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on travel abroad, including on-site expenses.
An Ordinary General Assembly was convened to elect the president, who could end up in a deadlock again.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person who would know how to deal with football in the future.
However, after concluding the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16, when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
There was no consensus as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which full representation is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Executive Committee could no longer shed more light on the situation, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which, from the management of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are more suited to Pelta.
"I would like to have the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who runs for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the decision on the new president will be made in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will again be the protagonist, and so we will cooperate more willingly," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in the management of football, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"In any case, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) that will try to equip a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he cannot find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would neither present himself as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and I wouldn’t stand as a candidate in the election.”
"But to this day no such person has been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Paclík also points out that if he wins, he would remain president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I might be interested in.”
"It was insane for me to hear some say that at this point they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What is supposedly most annoying to Paclík at this time is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less profit," Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name Pelta was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some caution from his previous statement that "the Pilsen Club would sell if Pelta becomes president".
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine that, for example, as the head of the representation."
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel capable," added Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He relies on his management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathy to Spartan President Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etinsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it was exerting pressure on political leaders to devote more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be addressing.”
“If they raise gambling taxes, as political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to end,” he said.
In addition, Paclík now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "not partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically assigning my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would guarantee that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the football team’s possible victory.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to take part at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas about football management.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday."
“Feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Club of Jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and on the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly, the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the re-adaptation of the Civic Association’s most important document that was used as a lure to win the delegates.
“If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with his head.
“He’s been in the football world for over a year, and he’s already achieved some successes.”
"His attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," Pelta told his opponent, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lower competitions to the upper ones.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately afterwards I would engage in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modification of the staff.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
“Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the most decisive day in his representative career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association in the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemian case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work initiated by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not re-presenting himself as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop and hinder me every step of the way,” he said.
“Many people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then everyone else would also give up.”
“It’s about having faith so you don’t give up like that, no more,” he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to lose now was finished.”
"There are processes that have started and will have their effect within a couple of years and I wouldn't want anyone to stop them," he said, worried that if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before Hashek's time.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him are above all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a few chosen ones.”
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one part of the Czech Republic and another part of the Moravia, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which represents a problem for the young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined in the fight for the presidential election, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes," Rajchl said, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kroner of disadvantaged contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lot law.
On the other hand, it acknowledges its part of the fault that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will likely follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and will not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that in my favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being in the water is.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Laying on her back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swam towards the marble angelotes, who awaited her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder has explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only annoys you that bathers have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine-smelling, while running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful trio of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why the pools have to be always so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The splashing in the pool and the essential oils of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, the indoor pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and the history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrate waters in a unique karstic cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, the pools of which are made of alkaline waters and are located in a building in the form of a bottle.
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at the Zurich roofed pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow-covered, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice of skiing on the slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The <0xC3><0x96>tztal water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the mountains of <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise up in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the chlorine smell in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in her search for beautiful bathing spots, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found herself with blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsed windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decadence was countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can neo-Romanesque elements of the times of their construction be discovered in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the style of the Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bath of pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to fuse different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that wagering on global commodity exchanges raises prices, and banks charge with responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer campaign specifically targets Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, betting on commodities was thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The leading experts agree that players have decoupled themselves from offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The stakes on rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare.”
Ackermann is the largest banker, especially in bonds.
"The Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price bets," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether Ackermann addresses the issue of starving people or Deutsche Bank’s fame.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before he leaves his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And you need to hardly care about possible losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bets.
Many of the bank’s clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel out all investments from which money comes out of agrarian speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The House 21 in Vienna
The Pavilion Moved
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postwar architecture is passionate, the clear shapes, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new building materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a contemporary landmark of architecture.
It made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was renovated in 1962 and inside it opened a 20th century museum, it was called the "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arc, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skating in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and patrons of the monuments, provided public funds and established their patronage.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore, and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its move to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, a fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was installed, and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany shades and protected against oxidation.
And the cinema room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap, and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “awaken the right awareness.”
In this case, the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a stroke of urban luck. The completely new and planned "center station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another blow of luck happens: House 21 could receive reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, is negotiating with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn Plans a Winter Crisis Package of Millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train breakdowns in the winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent this year more than 70 million euros, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For what it is necessary to achieve a better availability of vehicles and the railway network even with an extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from tracks and walkways.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice floors for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train failures and delays also this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations due to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a axle breakdown at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank to pay million-dollar fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem emerges, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to put an end to the quarrels due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage bonds.
The financial market regulator NCUA recriminates many large banks to induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to repay the losses of millions.
The agreements currently concluded are its first type.
The regulator had also ordered accounts from other major banks and in the summer opened lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or to punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of lawsuits.
It blames the 18 major international banks for the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taking advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a claim from the FHFA, a business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without giving an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology as the long-term development forecasts of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s commercial report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus ascended to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the compromise so far.
He praised the direction that handled the ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative IT services such as the operation of computational centers.
The over 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s shares in the stock market rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable tech companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat becomes concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a "bloody ideology" that resurfaces.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was long believed dead returns, since the bombings in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there have been no more episodes of violence with a far-right background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network uncovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, let alone predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, on the contrary, that one of the perpetrators of the crime was a whistleblower of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a whiplash: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcaster Hürriyet also does not insist on drawing up this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long ago searched for suspects in the far-right circle.
Some are even less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants are lost, only self-defense and weapons are left."
"This will be the best self-protection."
“Germany’s internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
Which means that if Germany’s internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks exacerbate the group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was then criticized mainly the deficiency of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen bombing, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, and his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media once again shows how deeply since then the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country is.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revalorization of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words.
The Bank of the Lake Zurich Scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has moved from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, it was announced in July that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly delighted, praises Switzerland for its beauty and praises UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future teammates.
“The USB has achieved a revitalization.”
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The president of the USB board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was announced that Weber would be advising the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
Suddenly he becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven again that it deserves the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared to the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis has begun.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also daunting, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s major banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "In front of my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came out that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To cope with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked with contempt until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 in Switzerland's second highest-paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly been tax-fraudled with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with payment compensation.
In doing so, UBS more or less confessed to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank’s secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: investment banking through wrong speculation and asset management through tax fraud aid.
And just when it was quieter again, just when it was thought UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case, it turns out that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
The idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long been presented, arose to be the guardians of the world’s greatest goods: no too great risk, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry such as Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
This is where Swiss banks have been residing for years: from the national bank, to the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy swivel door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front there are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "safety".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book Der UBS-Crash.
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
What do they think?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to make the two different precursor banks of UBS complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to take a step from learning at the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: the delinquency came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the consortium’s head, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They were headed by the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well for him.
In forex trading and in stock trading it was at its highest.
However, corporate advisors highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the language of fixed income banking, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize U.S. mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the downturn for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
The UBS positions have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a job almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, in which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, end the investment banking, focus on the management of assets, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But the investment banking needs to decline a lot, it’s clear right now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he asserted: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Removes 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is certainly asking right now.
So far, he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has frightened U.S. investors earlier this week.
Government changes in Athens and Rome are still in effect.
Restricted industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its origin.
General relief from government changes in Rome and Athens may not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Janney Montgomery Scott’s Mark Luschini.
First and foremost, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Standard Securities Index closed with a fall of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is placed at the end of its boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistical office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from its point of view it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles aside and enters the U.S. tech sector.
Her investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s share price and makes it quote against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.

Smart fats are spreading in cities
In many places greyhounds are considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grays belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors about the shit and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means have appeared against "problematic birds" so far.
Fats no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first symposium on fats in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the countryside of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture visibly wipe out traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the falling of trees that house them make it difficult for birds to live.
The fats are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district's fat people jumped to negative press headlines.
Critics have rated hunting animals by bird traps and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and evicting them in a normal way does not achieve anything," said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscape designer at Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals drift, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
It is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of evicting animals from sensitive residential areas and bait is possible for them to resettle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against treating animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a spike in the face with plunge."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger grazing teaching circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signage informs about the life of intelligent birds.
In the meantime, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism of the noise of birds: "Everything is forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, greasers not only harness the resources to access shale bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grades how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second rehearsal, the cunning fats had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva on a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four grays got it in the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the playoffs the latest tickets for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal scored 6-2 (2-1) to Bosnia and Herzegovina and, after the 0-0 of the one-way match, made the five consecutive Euro Cup appearances.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back game with the outsider Montenegro, after in the one-way game (2-0) they left things clear.
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a lazy 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a red card (54th).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a free-kick from over 30 meters to get to the top of the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his talents to score from a distance and got 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not appear in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, leader of English Manchester City, scored a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek strikes for Czech Republic
Then, Ergolding's collegiate Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark scored a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European Champion qualified for the fifth consecutive time for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last minute, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal (9th).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front lap, very right on Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the world-renowned goalkeeper, the forward of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentencing the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey has taken advantage of the marvel of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his seat on the third-placed bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the final of the European Cup.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. The striker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow him to score any goals.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute besieged Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the European Cup
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a preliminary decision, put himself at the head in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the defending team avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead of him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, scoring 1-0.

SAP aims to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software manufacturer, is investing billions in the coming years in China and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015, there will be approximately two billion dollars in circulation (approximately 1.5 billion euros), the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
“We will get more R&D facilities and hire workers,” said Bill McDermott, co-chair, at a conference in Beijing.
Staff is expected to grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are based in the boom country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.

SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"We currently want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through extensive instruction."
Massacre at a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about the First World War, “starts with a long dramatic personae of the kind that can make one fall to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Smoothly start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative, and this dramatic person will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an uncommon book, which he rightly describes as “an anti-history work.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.”
The beauty and pain of battle combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from high school and botanicals to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the Western front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall on bees; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an unstoppable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
“Lack of facts,” Mr. Englund observes, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the offshore fleet.
His stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more alive in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Succeed them, everywhere succeed them."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about succession food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram's fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and dried potato peels; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive towards savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are meant for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a bestseller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind it."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar “to a convict being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old disappearing Europe, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good-dressed clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and embed their genitals with it in the hopes of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often leads to a lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation made by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is agile but not extravagant, perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way the war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels such as No Novelty on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if I came from his book, ripped that page of dramas personae from between your fingers, and burned it with a spark.
After a false step before, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen on the night of Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation plagued with challenges for the police department.
Recent episodes of weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, violating departmental norms and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the “okups”.
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye on Zuccotti.
The officers increased the so-called disorder training — counter-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived at the “last minute,” someone familiar with the orders said, who referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to enter Zuccotti Park," the person, who spoke anonymously, said.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do so when there were as few people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with headlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests needed to be made in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent police from taking action in the park, and that they had been abruptly treated by agents.
Mr Browne said the mobile TV units on Church Street, along the park’s western edge, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the crowd of protesters’ personal belongings, including baggage and plastic garbage bags packed with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to methodically arrest them.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were locked between them by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The eviction operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “altering public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the superior officer in uniform in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief detective, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, from the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents’ coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city’s access to a health care fund to detain groups in charge of work.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this allegation.
At a hearing at City Hall last month, Education Counsel Dennis M. Walcott said redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council counterattacked, saying that nothing in the budget specified that support staff members of the school would be fired.
City District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been insufficiently subsidized chronically.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five out of eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. District 36’s budget fell by 3.26% this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school's payroll to a bursary, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” says the complaint draft, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for America’s involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Massachusetts Democrat), along with Senators John McCain (Arizona Republican) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut Independent), applauding the Libyans for their successful "rebellion" by the U.S. and its troops.
“This resolution is to honor Libya’s brave men as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It's a bipartisan statement of support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and with the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and never came to a vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then Congress’s indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was assassinated on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have so far been unsuccessful in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors—especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes—the opportunity to brag that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can fulfill, while Representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the limit of two terms for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Illinois Democrat) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Shocked but not defeated," Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in the face at a constituency in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway melody "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted when she returned.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, "Quite well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special program, which aired the eve of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program looked at Giffords’ recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, she sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frowning of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he did not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly treated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines broke into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them as a kind of orphan child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was a pity.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes worshipping, American public.
He gives praise to the troops for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they are pitied by those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan, said.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from combat with the Navy, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas set aside her concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court ruling at a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or give proper justice after their claims.
Burke says he's going through the army's main floor, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of which could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy—essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damage suffered by active-duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women-soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, besides her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the not-for-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the "personality disorder" diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to give them a break from service - a common event, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Service Network group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the aggressions are remarkably under-reported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, it amounts to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also looks at prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times apart to a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her aggressor – from a cut in her arm – was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personal witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, ""That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed from service under less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case filed by Lyman and his co-defendants continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as the responsibility poses.
And he adds: "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go his way, Burke, the plaintiff’s attorney, will put his other hundreds of plaintiffs in line for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the UK’s DEMOS study center.
Facebook’s pool of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way vendors have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in the “Likes,” wall messages, and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a boom in research, boosting the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook deletes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunks.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
“We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “pinching” its own population to get data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates long ago who argue that the site should provide other amount of research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with students’ Facebook public walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know which part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paperclip and a pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
“There’s no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social is still happening offline.”
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brains behind the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told a crowded room with 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he “did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views.”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the victims’ relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he was not a mentally ill person, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I’d like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” said a relative of a victim.
“It would be a lot easier if it seemed like it.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Showed at a Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has been dusted off as an advancement of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer, and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonk of flowcharts — a man who believed many executives suffered “a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for a lengthy and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively at his new computer company NeXT, awaiting popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely’s interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during their transportation.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full copy was discovered on VHS in the director’s garage.
This archive material, slightly re-edited, is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost 68-minute interview, which arrives at Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to move faster toward the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how you learned to run a business:
“Over the years in business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers you invariably give are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was in the eye of good coverage, and then adjusting to a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that assured that they could determine retail commercial costs.
The Pope's Joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
Describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and yelling through the public phone and coming back a minute later to the public phone from the door next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak nearly abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into squabbles just before the Pope himself woke up to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
About Improving Innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a client if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 credit days, he had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of his market share.
“Tell me you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopiers and printers, and what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision making.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly rotted because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all boils down to the taste – it boils down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were casually the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computing, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Health Care Law Rivals While Court Accepts Case
The day the Supreme Court met in private to examine the politically controversial issue of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were handcuffed at a law firm-sponsored dinner that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly examine the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic five-and-a-half-hour allegation is expected by March, and the result will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be at its peak when the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be discarded will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees included Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate, and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon Code 4C, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive breach of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the lawsuits of several judges acquitted by the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were handcuffed at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their appearance and attendance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say mix court activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in advocating the law for now to be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he is going to do so.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft, with an option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place from where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its largest order in history for commercial jets for their value in dollars - 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts of fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs – is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the rise in oil price.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft at bay.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the fight for governor.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview one day after Sunday’s vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and the victory at Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly outperformed Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and he elected Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Violence, however, has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would hamper the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can't be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by any means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Commerce Minister, said "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they’ll realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that won’t go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs from poorly managed companies and loss-making companies such as railroads.
Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens with “important chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “risks down” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Serious Warnings About Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chained financial reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digging the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to lay off civilians in order to meet the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good will.”
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While war-time funding in the accounts of Overseas Contingency Operations is not directly affected by the hijacking, war efforts would be adversely affected by severe disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The hiring of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war.”
“The payroll would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result with which one can live, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of U.S. national security, and should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is yet to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, despite arriving at a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a grim panorama of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"In fact, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta lays out new details of how reductions “generate significant operational risks: delays in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the Humvee.
Stopping the development and additional testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “pilled” with an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridiculous with his denials quickly repelled by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violating campaign funding related to covering up an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus set off by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about the traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given exam answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we should all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you,” deception detection is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
The liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always chatter, babble, rubbish or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years researching the scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emergent body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps you navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies," while women say more "other-oriented lies" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than people who are not married do.
We also know that if you are perceived as an offender, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called "creating a baseline."
Helps provide benchmarks to then measure changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally kicks all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when you see their feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper body as they try to remember their story, point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview exhaustion” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely show that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his leg to the bottom and used the time spent as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distance language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman...Ms. Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well...to tell the truth...to what I know...to what I understand."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it would move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and hopes the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are explored to avoid the areas of Nebraska’s Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
“This is a true path of progress,” Nebraska Republican Rep. Lee Terry told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the State Department, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are weighing legislation to force a drift away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her little daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The diatribe of "Lady Marmalade" singer scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," says her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 of last year when Tramwayist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes,' and I went to pick her up,'" he said.
LaBelle annoyed the pregnant woman.
“He said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left his daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and she started pouring the water out of the bottle on me.”
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” the girl’s mother said.
LaBelle swung over her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled into a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle’s representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer-supporting children’s association.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it’s directed at a kindergarten teacher holding an 18-month-old boy in her arms.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated high expectations regarding progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost impacts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of crops were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, ma garbanzo.
The decline in economic activity has generated, up to November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate of the state during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloes were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the population.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be indirectly explained, depending on the actions that have been carried out since the public policy.
“What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of market liquidity due to a constraint on money laundering legislation that was passed in Congress, and for people who grasp dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is exacerbated by considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state work without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor backlogs are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Along with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded in 2011, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled $630.697, representing a fall of 87.74 percent over the same year from $5.12 billion.
For its part, the State Government’s Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos a year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be allocated to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was by an amount of 2 billion pesos have not observed the state profits, and in November.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés’s government shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the terrain we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we failed to align the effort of everyone and especially the good synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"Low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that it is necessary to cause the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better aligns the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He was sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug addict was driving a white pick-up truck, carrying a black bag in the car’s box and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s seat, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person remains internally in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
It owes contributions to works
The social works covered in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because they have not met the State Government with the corresponding contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 per cent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these becomes valid.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a share," he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute at that time.
"It already happened to us in the previous six-year because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, has been asked to rush the measures so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Court validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies brought against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers in issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary decided to dismiss also the demand made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general norms the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not consider that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the Federal Executive, who has by constitutional mandate, the Rectory of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which somehow invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data cast by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6,74 total acts.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data cast by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the total votes corresponding to 674 thousand 879.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As you will remember, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had some omitted his publication of the Official's report on the planned deadlines.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state president's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal stated that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM, it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given on the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and calculation in the file of the box or does not operate in the power of the President of the same; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the candidate who has obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the second session there is the express request of the post-candidate to the representative of the party.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary calculation it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, as long as there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case it will be excluded that there have been electoral packages.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 acts total.

Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "Just when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".

Three abandoned corpses found in Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities brought to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 kilometre road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place observed that in the farmhouse, whose barda is beige with coffee, was the gate open pair by pair.
Looking inward, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow stripe with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white stripe with tights.
Just a metre away was the body of another individual with a red beach shirt and blue jersey pants.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no caps were found on the site.
In the barde of the farm are appreciated legends that go from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured at 11 in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretariat made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine burials.

By marking them off and conducting the inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who on seeing the military tried to flee.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the stricken confidence in Italy.
Stressing pressure on Monti to hurry up, market instability put Italian bond yields at 10-year BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to bail out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
“We believe Professor Monti’s efforts are meant to have a good result,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in your efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the election.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 convened reached the 50 meetings.
A contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, account for an extensive record of Class A interselection games, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful Premier League clubs in England maintain an intense activity in league championships and domestic cups, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with the Spanish Furia in complicated eliminations of the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
Ticos footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international grip in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish national team is of the archer <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s head coach, holds 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized by UEFA the previous week along with the other centenaries of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and close to Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 attendances and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five overcame the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 performances in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its two-decade celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was confirmed by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday the 20th will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on holiday; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask him because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the point of this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years ago to make it seem like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are thrilled that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours has stayed together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we’re all lucky to be still alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as one remembers that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being captivated by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh and talk a lot more about music and fubol.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first ones I think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassist I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it’s no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came out at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from various ailments, including cancer of the tongue, which he has operated on four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
He was operated on four times of tongue cancer, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which have been added other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has served imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official group, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in all the political affairs between the two nations," the South American presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation of its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the implementation of fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) gray list, made up of countries that have not implemented all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s specialty press officer in Spain, during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “accessible” video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook up less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most skilled will be able to give a "second turn" to the levels of the game, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting in that the mustache plumber will have to roam mined platforms of danger in order to release Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom approves Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he gave formality to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that was demanding Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision was due to the independence of the judiciary and executive powers, taking into account that a court of sentence had already ordered extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure, he "did not put his hands" on court decisions and filed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional proceedings to prosecute the former president from 2000 to 2004 have been exhausted.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the Q120 million defamation in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process prior to extradition, but the Prosecutor appealed and revived the case.
Trinihove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the drop in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, there are hundreds of jobs currently available for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held at the former factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of graduation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the former Socialist Education Councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former Mayor and current Ecosocialist Councillor Ricard Gomà.
The large hall of La Fabra i Coats was also attended by the current Social Welfare and Family Councillor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinihove was born in a very difficult time and that today is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinihove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evicted an occupied farm where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived the neighbors of 51 of Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday noon the property they were illegally occupying, and where they were organizing macrofiestas that were desperate for the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of crowded parties, lasting up to two days and desperate for tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club points out that the invaders of the estate were unfair competition, as they sold the cups for three euros, while in the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had to respond to neighboring complaints about noise, while, according to the point, the discomfort is not caused by the customers of the disco, but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the vecino.
The head of the club explained that the inconveniences were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and for nine months he "forgave" the rent.
The City Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately evicting the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the okupas had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even thefts have occurred.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and be convincing against the incivism that has been generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police rushed to 35 rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
The park or the mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy about fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a few promotional banners for Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan Barcelona park.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York City’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that do not orient on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park is reflected in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
It was in these until, in September, the city called a mega competition consisting of 16 contests for so many other gates to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurring theme when two members of this ancient caste of elect recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact justifies one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, have said.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not taken place.
"We can start from the premise that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, due to its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex,” says the architect for whom the title of “Colserola’s gates” encloses a “lexical trap”: one should not think of them “as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where action must be taken”.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project public space" after the experience experienced in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "swan's song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, overstepping it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters."
More closely to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol thinks that, by simplifying, the Vallesan side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by a merely topographic issue.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken bag", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the lifeline that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he points out) that have had to create: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross competitions have been convened -he says- in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In its view, yes, the City Council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would effect a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that followed him for alleged blackmail
After being held for 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the mayor’s brother.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil García made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic fee for the regiomontano city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother and on September 2 he was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor’s Office 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
It remained there for the 49 days following the dictation of a second rooting order after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office dismissed the crimes of cohabitation and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the middle security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internment trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was turned over an arrest warrant by the Second District Penal Court’s secretary, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, sufficient evidence had been verified to determine Jonah’s guilt, such as collecting 1.5 million pesos from the betting house’s representatives in exchange for allowing the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; so in the next hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, Attorney General Ramiro Arias questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the bookmaker’s partners granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and no claim may be filed in respect of the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to pay damages or punishment.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the bookmaker, at about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results cast on the accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that research done in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at the 30-degree slope.
For the time being, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation could last several months, even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft uphill terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, TBS head Pérez Jácome listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports at the AICM placed conditions suitable for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced towards the area bordering the DF and the State of Mexico, cloud layers were presented at low altitude.
Selected Routes:
Due to cloudy conditions, the crew may have searched for an area with lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available to date makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The dispersion pattern of the aircraft remains allow us to assume that the helicopter impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident there is still no evidence on the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the middle sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along that route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security leads research to discover obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity', which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population, whether or not entitled to participate, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out on children, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (West Mexico State) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Unidad Deportiva Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Unidad Deportiva Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day, he said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, with the purpose of avoiding risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
On Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure reading, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics are applied to all participants (the aim is to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, there was also a dramatic rise," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others due to its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows to detect if they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-coloured folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of you suffering from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying sitting in front of the TV most of the day and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a blend with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that sends the pavement were even met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 chunks each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction is adequate, it would be necessary to reduce the number of chunks.
In his conference A technological opinion of the batches, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some northern cities, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of loops.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others of low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that on the streets the strength of the asphalt is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed, is bathed with asphalt.
As vehicles pass through and efforts are generated, this allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, he abounded, a last layer is placed called a tread folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e., a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the treading folder also requires having the right thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil becomes moist, the water diffuses into the interior of the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of lumps.
In the process of forming a flap, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers also explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, in order to avoid frequent formation of bumps.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair the bulges easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 princess.
Once again the Cauca Valley is left with the cravings of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, looking at the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia), Giulia), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia), Giulia), Giulia (1990), Giulia), Giulia), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia), Giulia), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia (1990), Giulia), Giulia), Giulia), Giulia (1990)
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Señorita Colombia, it was not in vain that she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that won queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carreta Leamos.
To the questioner the Vallecaucanana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culturalize, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
I currently read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that disliked first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina manifested feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise pass what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched, Valle is said to have been burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist hinted that being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on stage".
And that was noticed in her first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton Beach and her two parades at the coronation evening.
Although in both he was sure, it was noticed that he lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the RCN's "How to Live at Home" program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not remain as queen".
In addition, Valle was at last very evasive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For some reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, which the truth to me was not very noticeable, lowered her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the Vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
His body was never his stronghold and here he was taken.”
For this prize, which for the first time awarded the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit, a cruel vaticinium arose, which was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the contentile that Raymundo granted Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her strenuous passage through Cartagena, was dodged her crown.
This was the work of the carpenter who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lophoscopist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist at the CTI in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the clash of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the CTI section, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of El Chocó, where he often had to intern for more than five days in the jungle to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, specialised in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliasar was warned to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night, he left for Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being from the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decadent card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much slimmer.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints to those on the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the highest head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a dactyloscopist of the Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can become key in resolving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, lofoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identities of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false bills or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in a case of theft, it was up to him to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had leaned his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take out a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had been involved in different thefts," he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or ribbon is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registrar.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes an imprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective batting is performed.
‘Indignated’ Challenges New York Authorities
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
Much of it followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter Manhattan Square again, under a court order, from where they were evicted early in the morning, and by trying to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order allowing the "indignated" to camp again on the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the "indignated" response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to remain encamped.
In addition, the "indignated" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization said that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already displaced in support of members of the movement and had tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned building - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which provoked "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or forbidding protesters to return to the park with stores or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the early-morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people would not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,” as “some businesses had received threats” and neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that in the background Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers than those of American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "missing respect for freedom of expression."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two-month-long protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", baywatch rescuer, playboy bunny, rock musician Tommy Lee's wife and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private CTV channel announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the TV show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online distribution of a home porn video in which she appears alongside her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not unfamiliar to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has suffered since World War II.
The early estimates of the Tokyo government amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The record in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upsurge in the purchase of machinery to restore areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditures seen from January to March, the first recession after six months of uninterrupted ups.
However, the real revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of crises to reinforce – or rebuild – infrastructures, to use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, flattened their weak results between July and September to the yen’s valuation.
As markets continue their siege of the periphery countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
“We must be alert to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
As it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, rushing eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens re-emerges in doubt
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstalled in the parquet floors, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic transitional government comes more from the demands of Brussels than from a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demands for the new date.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the staff code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear the doubts about his position: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to complying with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economics spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said troika inspectors would return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what it takes to pay the sixth instalment” of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek maze still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a preponderant global place in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she noted lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in those with the goal of reducing the amount of income to less than half".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the most disadvantaged, especially for the most disadvantaged."
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit stands not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote “two basic goals”.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million of those households to get out of the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "remains" of the "popbaquero".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredit is “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty”, and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Union by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe had not initially been included on the agenda, but the issue was put on the agenda in the fall, in particular to satisfy militants who consider the government’s policy to be currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be too strict in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The several-minute standing ovation won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in one motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, "it is time to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country under the European Central Bank directive against the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxious to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or of the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of “French-German friendship,” Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in casualties due to illness
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the issue, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the will to rigorously save, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before it can take the leave.
In short, unless a specific company agreement exists, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of unemployment without remuneration in the event of a layoff (up to now, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority is also putting on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of job losses.
"Controls are going to increase considerably and, moreover, if someone is found to be committing a fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Bertrand warned on RTL Sunday.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of job losses fraud.
In fact, since 2002, this issue has been continuously monitored and a number of policy offensives have been launched, which have normally yielded results.
The French are only sick in the rest of Europe.
Let us first take a close look at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and work accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
As a result, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French wage earners surveyed said they had not taken a single day off due to illness.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave were less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were more prolonged.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely to get sick than in other areas.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, 13% of the 285,000 carried out by CNAM found that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e., 37.050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of cases were considered "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, taking as its starting point a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a tax revenue loss of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for losses and, without a doubt, considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos declared to Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment," said the head of government, who made his first public speech during the opening debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions taken during the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the new government's "main task", as the country's stay in the eurozone is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "up to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures.
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as combating waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would sign nothing due to ex-pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, says report from Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is considering this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent Economist Intelligence Unit survey that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, although most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this respect is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not agree with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said by teleconference yesterday that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a trial against them should not be initiated.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not as clear, as the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, their recommendations suggest that it should be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been rejected legally, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls on health professionals to be trained on the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for it, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, to be considered as euthanasia and to undergo the same procedures.
Other experts make reservations.
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the stance of the experts signing the report “extreme” because, among other things, the practice of euthanasia is not limited to patients in the terminal stage.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called “a manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenges the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to quit power
Damascus denounces "conspiration"
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters protested in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria was intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists and denounces that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have expressed their support for President Assad’s departure from power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king said in an interview with the BBC.
The head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime."
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to the crackdown in Syria, said State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during shelling and shooting with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "advancing towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not fade,” he added, guaranteeing that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently considering a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he believes is locked in “paranoia”.
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday judged the Arab League's decision "wrong", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated with political parties yesterday and today he met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President-elect of the Council.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would ask for a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, undoubtedly of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is “certain that markets will have patience and understand it”.
His appointment by the President initially gained market approval, but then worries arose, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he believes.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the goal that Italy "recover its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted over the past months, has called for the adoption of new measures of rigor.
The Italian "chief of the chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not respect the requirements in terms of deficit".
Monti, famous for his competition and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA said last week it was “seriously concerned” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
His company's financial problems would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a member state reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., it has increased by 49%, compared with a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in the total number of crimes against Jews and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the organization’s official.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he said, adding that such efforts could include improving police reporting on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter Changes Platform and Looks More Like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to resemble Facebook a little more.
A new tab "Activity" and another so-called "name" allow you to more readily and lively follow the activity of other "Twitters", that is, of those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate any messages as favorites, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before being released to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctful functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another persona, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation with differing opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom writes.
Austro-Hungarian
Introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the ruling Social Democratic/Christian coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the very Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic Vice-Chancellor of Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, the public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens with new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic highs that resulted in the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, driven by buys from investors who see it as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar re-quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that provoked the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts the archipelago’s exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues earned abroad by Japanese companies when converting them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing the yen's rise in prices could lead to a weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased by five trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) its purchases of Treasury Letters, bringing to 55 trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the market.
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags flake
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges plunge a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions in relation to the loan yields of the euro area states most affected, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent profits.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing concerns from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a limited range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates exceed 6%.
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in the southern countries, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for time from the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of suffocation with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on October 27 would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for the growth figures of the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favorable than the 0.3% projected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has seen 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there’s a topic that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations in mind or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it considers all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will involve doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or of Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
The choice of Berlin is going to involve an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
We need to think about the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would undermine the realism of the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not manifest in principle opposition to this type of energy, as surveys show.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and that can create non-delocalizable jobs.
If France decides to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of those SMEs and the loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for either people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has nearly two million immigrant workers", while in the case of the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to including trivialities, indicating that co-development will allow to solve the “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may prove cost-effective electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of economic flows on migrant wages, and countries that re-increase wages.
Immigration constraints weaken growth and undermine employment.
Concerns about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pressing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly pursue professions in sectors where employment is lacking.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive impact on nationals’ wages and employment.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows implies a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue less expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the average public budget throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The pallinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence needs to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature of the absolute European monarch or a stop to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take strikes of effect, but a common exercise, full-fledged, calm and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that clings to the orders of markets and rating agencies, the one that suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
Interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "no contact" chips become widespread
The World Chip Card Show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations from the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (expected to be 580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
In order to put the upper hand, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it’s only a first step towards the future of payment: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're backing up."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Crédit Agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which have long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algeria already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports demonstrate that they are cooperating," he said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the walkways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terrorism
The study of the calls pointed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we certainly have to wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or explosive devices increasingly complex and in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of enlightened people unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants embark on the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily oriented towards churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its feuds in the north.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, particularly the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would encompass from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Regarding China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more buzzing foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the “Grand Old Party” nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulation of their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of whole fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if it involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to possess a sophisticated outlook on foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “shrouds” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations in relation to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-best-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing “trying to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964.
Tehran Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the “boys” of Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges Obama’s national security balance in a more positive way, which ended bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts military interventions that lead to a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the Baltic shores, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the inflow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive to Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover the entire French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land flow by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-consuming and increasingly limited Western countries.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the managers of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas point of arrival.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel coated with cement to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extreme measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as much as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but the project’s leaders renounced it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish itself permanently at sea off its shores.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have predicted joints that are expected to have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, towed by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased all of its gas transport capacities to the company for a renewable period of twenty-five years.
“Gazprom will pay for full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually being transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy pine-planted coast.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the exit gate of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its gum, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch to the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to reach a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far has remained the confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookshops, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city center, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress made in the last 15 years is considerable.
“At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be noted that disabled unemployed persons continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that “constitute the quid of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité association noted that the surveyed directors have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of wheelchair users, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
As they face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly game generates for them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his forward’s resentment gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and because she is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," the Lille forward replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", has been justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit down.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Let’s not forget about “pleasure.”
He has been cheering the Blues since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This will undoubtedly reinforce the “particular” character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has for his part referred to "pride".
"Pride" for contesting "a gala game".
"Pride" also for checking, as a "neighbor", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share plane with the Bleus to... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal's Paulo Bento faces with great optimism the game back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the game, both teams were lacking in realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has led since September 2010, is going to qualify for the Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way match (0-0), on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given it peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house."
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Stadium of Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the game "is very equalized", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the game is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", Carlos Queiroz's successor has, however, relativized.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored out of the house," says Bento.
“We’re going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it is realistic.
