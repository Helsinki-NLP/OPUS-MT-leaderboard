The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the commodity value test....
I am a #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it is not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions on what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>179.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be encouraged to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help for a while, bring the bottle etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved with.
As long as you can be a child, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy on his own for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s fine.
You can decide for yourself if this is right for your children.
It’s not like he’s supposed to wrap K2 and go to sleep for hours.
Purely legal, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes along.
Because if something really should happen, such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, at your own discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want to think of the title everywhere anymore.
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overflowing himself with food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation into his therapist, goes to a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who before each suicide is commissioned anonymously to go to the scene of the suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain and ultimately confronts the patients with their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window another drives with intent to die)
This fear faced in the book is called "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the rough plot I’m pretty sure the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this story is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for wifi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference returned?
Child, 4 y., splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splitters under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
I tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any loop of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker in addition to the sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It dominates the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders log in fully automatically to a suitable digital center.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read with matching centrals.
For headquarters that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake lines as well as the ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake controls or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with direct voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops on a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC automatic commuter train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC circuits.
After my voucher is no longer renewed due to a complaint that has not arrived to me, I will be making my order worth approx.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to drive up-skimming
Increasingly new Omicron cases are bringing politics and science to the UK.
By New Year’s Eve, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccine offer.
LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move ahead with the coronavirus revival vaccines even faster than he has previously hoped, given the fast-growing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Given the Omicron variant, there is an emergency, which is why vaccine protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Now let's boost it!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price on collection?
I want everyone to use pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on an official's feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books in total.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today can't.
Apparently the chair had an unobtrusive defect in the sale.
How else can such a pad damage occur after 9 months?
First try on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for approx.
No more 14 days.
That’s why I’ve always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want that please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write here a little bit in detail about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately is too common is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or think we could not help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond the range of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of pulling the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help anyway... I know I can’t.
This will never make it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a stunning look: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was trusted.
Again nothing: For the second time in not even three months the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick, looking back at the Cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, however, it did not settle down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) -defeat in the basketball-Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the manner of appearance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma is mentioned as a substitute: the three-rate was just 13%, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) at say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
In response, John Patrick said: “We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and we didn’t implement what we trained.”
That is to move the ball.
His reaction to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "To win a horny game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like before 10,000 people".
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game for his team.
"The best gamer I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already lagged 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to fight.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Max Raabe is 59 years old.
He is able to impress his audience with reinterpretations of percussionists from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have liked to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it doesn't make any difference.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 – “on official instruction” to curb the coronavirus.
Other performances planned during the Advent period must also be cancelled, as stated on the website of the singer, who now turns 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists want to pick up their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his comrades.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of drums and songs in the style of comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his hit album "For Women That's Not a Problem" (2013) - second place on the charts.
He made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and thoughtful about etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be missed from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?

It still doesn't work I can only crave the cover sheet but not leaf.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Day Mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the Ampel-Coalition about further tightening of the tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.

If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipment itself take?
I've already cut my finger
This is an absolute cowardice
At least 100 dead in tornadoes in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the United States caused devastation and possibly up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a 320-kilometre-long snowstorm of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was swept through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
In Kentucky alone, the death toll is up to 100, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she has sold out the #NAME# showcase.
That's too bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
When are you going to sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was coming or being processed, since I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees monetary premiums for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to vaccine calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the readiness for coronavirus vaccinations.
He moved into a company he's slandered about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Apparently, he didn’t get stuck in his old spot and was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn’t find his job well either.
There are too many variables.
Please take up the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screenshot.
Good morning - I am interested in the Boone Dining Table, White.
Is it also available in 230cm?
In our online shop kitchenpoint.de we supply all Smeg kitchen appliances and the corresponding accessories.
In principle, we check the quality and completeness of your order.
The new coffee machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee to your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the plastic surface in matte colors in combination with the matt brushed stainless steel front make the new SMEG coffee machine with milk foam a design object.
Due to the reduced design, all functions such as the degree of grinding and the amount of water, as well as the choice between espresso, Americano, Ristretto or a mild coffee with only four buttons can be selected.
Thanks to the steam lance, coffee-milk and milk foam specialties can also be prepared.
Help with your first campaign
Boron to hello!
I’m currently running the adventure Over the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are conceived and now I am writing the entry adventure and stumble on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a truck with grains from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action will evolve.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins must be tempted by the heroes to lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuasion, action, threats, early detection of the danger, whatever comes to the mind of the players.
Group strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and swords
In case of unnoticed, the goblins latch on to the hero in a hollow path and flank to three on the left and on the right, bows arming the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
The heroes are all unconsciously found and then cured by the son of the village school, a half.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat is unavoidable, it is this half-herd that intervenes with two of its servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play a crucial role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m sure I will be following many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I broke up the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can get the receipts to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind the planning, but one could still show the last ten minutes (planned) as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 again there was an ignorance of the rules by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag you can change the tyres.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both decided that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio talks on the subject at Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility exists for Verstappen.
In my opinion, such basic rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It’s also not the first riddle rate, which is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in terms of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos's artificial commentary style, but I admit it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant nonsenses that both make it seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally unaware) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is taking over at Sky, in the run-out round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertisement, as you can listen to F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and this as a free TV station.
While you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me it would be shipped on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the stool).
I'm asking for support.
Ventilator pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, whole systems can be operated with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model of the fan pump, but they also offer to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be to call a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or similar...and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water was running backwards, the water running out of the basin through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up daily here.
Everything is going well on the way, it is going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is messed up just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course, Corona does not stop here.
Please do not rate as bad just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to scoff at these services, even if we say at the moment, they have a damn hard time.
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Is it possible to order the legs in light here too?
Amazon Founder Bezo Sends Astronaut Daughter and Moderator to Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ “New Shepard” rocket system.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under glowing blue skies, Bezos took in the freshly cured astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, who had four other passengers who had paid for their tickets.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He has worked hard on his missions and has had to do everything himself.
“She just flew along,” the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would rather return to space soon, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The missile system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, sometimes with gravity before the reusable object landed again, braked off by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-out trip: Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board at the first in July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy boss Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory does not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was also informed before studying about career prospects at the time, but I also thought that I would definitely like to study until my doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning the career prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck, etc.) you always hear about great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would be really interested in:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study / what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your comments!
I’m really unsure at the moment, and I’m thinking of maybe quitting my studies in 2022 and becoming a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience you will also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's only a post now.
Not only before the big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in the company.
As it seems, there are also the days before the holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week there was Maria’s Ascension, which we call “Ascension” in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails that had to be sent out before departure, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and it can't be?
Or because people want to pay as much in a short week as in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully angered.
What is this self-indulgence about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can’t afford them properly?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: Are we the only Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but still has no gifts.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by baking and baking cookies with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But until the mental days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, now I finally have to start."

NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in birding is solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable feather coat.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack or imbalance of protein and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be given during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.

DDR handwork model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the lok was in use in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare lok probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railroader ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and faults see the photos, function, the Günthero Günthero series is a
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided to supply the Siemens locomotives with the electric part as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with toothed bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the company numbers E 95 01-06.
They all survived World War II and then found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnwerk Dessau, the workability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When, with the progressive re-electification of the central German network, a growing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service emerged, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger numbers, were preferably constructed.
It was only when the E 94 could not be further increased that the E 95 came to the point of view of the work.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the Halle P railway station in 1960.
They were used in their own schedule mostly before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematic with increasing age was the complicated control of the locomotives.
Thus, it often occurred that shooters remained glued to switching operations.
Then the driver on this locomotive had to release the shooter again during the drive with a hammer and a wooden wedge.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of locomotive downtime.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new construction locomotives and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to renounce old locomotives and most splitter generators, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy one-man electric locomotives, which, due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visual conditions of the driver’s position, would have resulted in a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which quit service on October 5, 1970.
The new designation 255 001 has never been used.
With the exception of E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a lift lift at the main station Halle.
It took some time before those responsible for the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth keeping as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external development of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it for a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is maintained by the museum.
Since 1995, employees of the tradition community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational development of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paints, the transformers were checked and five drive motors are operational.
Until 1945, the locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branched outer tracks, where they proved to be reliable due to their drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary optical reworks at the locomotive in own work, dusted, with game tracks, basement smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small bearing- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and stock traces.
The F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are incorrectly produced.
The middle beam does not fit into the provided holder.
So I get sent new ones.
When will they be released?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the mold, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Can I get these sent to you?
Hello #NAME#, can I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjoining residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech county).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume that it was deliberately set on fire.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness prompted him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he is getting a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was not supposed to be vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine,” <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For a few months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because communication should not be about himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he was not vaccinated, circulates.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a priority in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has been long overdue - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Tens of thousands of firefighters without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia have been without electricity for about 24 hours after a fire with severe damage in a substation.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday night for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered nursing places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The caregiver thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant constraints.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire department and the THW for their tireless efforts,” said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Western network installers were initially only able to restart some lines provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage plane has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually switched on from 21.30.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last one affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 installers of Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
Authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important for citizens to take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and to communicate with local fire departments when help is needed," Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) said after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency power units, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary places of care in schools have been set up for those people who could not provide themselves or who require power-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good morning, guys.
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.

This is a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t push it in and shorten it.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
Yes, it's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!

The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost shameless.
We do not agree with this

To make the paint even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before using the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible, or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly line by line.
Light overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface area.
Avoid sweeping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could pass through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal glitters can occur when mixed with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The decals and decals make the models look true to their original appearance.
From emblems on aircrafts to ship names to ornamental stripes and badges on car models: the decals give the model the ultimate touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a quiet hand when glued.
Cut out each decal individually and place it in your place.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisten their backs briefly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wet.
Then you just push the picture a little bit off the paper and put the piece to the appropriate place on the model (which you have moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways.
Caution: Always check if the picture fits correctly before shoving it off the paper completely so that it doesn’t stick to your finger, scratch or even tear.
Vacuum excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book and have to log out and sign in and reload the book and look for the place until where I've read it.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much!
I will buy it elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Children's wishes treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in child welfare treatment for some time, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses the line.
In order to:
We had applied for the children's wish scheme in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
Attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and childbirth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet settle with the PKV.
We again applied for the cost takeover at the PKV and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have done more attempts than promised, logically calculating the most expensive with the PKV) we filed the invoices with the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out in the promises that with one birth the further attempts will fall?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (provided by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again?
All right, all right.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), obviously they have lost good customer.
You are welcome to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything to get the dresser completely messed up.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund was made and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I will remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to purchase, but we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition for it with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What's bothering you?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it reliable now?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will give up again soon, because it just doesn’t work here.

"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Protestant Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This floating state - Belarus is not a small one, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to go on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not firmly opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"She obviously can't make it through if a member state sets out to do its thing," as is currently the case in Poland, which does not even allow the EU's border agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU will pay another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principled agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authorities said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stoned by the migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk, having attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance sheet and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 final, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows are likely to break two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have irregularly overtaken.
A second objection was made to the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in the last round and was headed for his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase, in which the Dutch had overtaken the cars driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for the support

The Europa-Park, the name given to the Europa-Park Stadion of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
Members and permanent card holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Fuchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop.”
Since the beginning of the 1990s, cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in place.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Home" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noises at her front door.
Yesterday I left the contact form to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your messy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact woman #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
Yesterday we had chatted and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
With friendly greetings

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite means nothing.
That's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your I won't admit it either.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
You’re not as serious as your colleague.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
Because of me, one God set the whole thing in motion.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just concealing nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and don't continue to take it seriously like a colleague
To maintain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without indexing and color errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifying glasses are marked.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions that rarely meet the terms of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, please refer to the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – even in the case of impact loops – light reflections are generated.
Due to an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
Reflections on the surfaces of the lenses are less perceptible if the optimum conditions of use are met - a magnifying glass close to the eye.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Pine sale in Schoenwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
One day, a man is said to have driven home without his partner because they both couldn’t agree.
Every year, he plants well 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Or am I gone as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better judgment, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "turner", which by far does not sound so tasty.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit without any problems except a few failures.
The new fiber-optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives it.
However, on the other DLan module, which the Wifi sends out, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I get away in the house with the module, the less comes (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms are located away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber-optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optic so much internet speed is "lost" via the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When is it time to change the account
Whoever thought it would be quiet with the bank accounts now for the first time, looks deluded.
While many banks have taken advantage of the autumn to have their customers confirm their past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered it for daily money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank Group division - to 50,000 euros for turnover and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin even got right against this regulation.
Banks are already discussing whether institutions should make provisions - in the event that the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table top was delivered for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people.
The underframe is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their lives are like mountains and valleys.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was voted the most influential woman of the year by the Hollywood Reporter magazine.
For her, who made furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she gives herself one chip a day (yes, read correctly: one single chip from the bag).
It is a miracle that the hearts of both female and male fans still fly to her.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with luck - and still is looking for great love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 went even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - A 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat from his forehead.
Oh, that's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the tyre, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
To say goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich takes the 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I figured it out, I would have to score nine-and-a-half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two wins in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something on the material setting and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he made it to the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also imported his 22nd victory in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, finished in second place earlier this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
For the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the Zweierbob on her home run.
After the day before in the Monobob it was only enough for the fourth place, on Sunday she rose to the World Cup victory with the German triple success with debutant Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama will take me along.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay,” said Burghardt, emphasizing: “It’s not just pushing, but there’s a lot to do around it as well.”
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn’t get it and so I couldn’t redeem it, so I finally asked.
Through Corona last year I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now he said it had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I want to return it and then order it again as it is currently reduced :)
Why does the shipment not start until 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
Not until I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Yesterday was taken from your colleague.
Why this is a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And do not cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe one of them - or others as well...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogmama - sometimes apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten, he is actually 1 in 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we had a lot of cuddling and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because the hand is in the bandage wg burning).
He’s cooled up, and we’re seeing less (1-2x week) right now, which makes me feel very comfortable with my needs for affection and love.
My dog just has stomach pain, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which we naturally divide.
But cooking itself is a lot of work for me.
My PTBS disease is just fine, I am halfway well-treated and getting along.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and after-morning anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until after tomorrow, then is the weekend.
But after that, does it all go on?
It's only until your birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
I love the...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I’ll pack that down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Thank you very much, I can’t put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my Kptbs.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that’s why I thought I probably find fellow sufferers here...
I certainly wish you another relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But it was not confirmed.
At the time, I realized in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that for them it is just another subject such as mathematics or geology.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed that way.
How do you feel about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But would it just be odd to have a physics teacher who doesn’t believe in relativity?
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something like that?
I hope the question is not too private.
Can't change it or not? Please write in English I understand that too well
It's been a long time, so I'd give up.
That's good, thank you.
I look forward to receiving a feedback at the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (age 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
Firstly, the modern (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths intersect and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live for himself.
The transition is also, I believe, the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, the two soldiers fight against each other.
If that says anything, I’m grateful for any response.
Our little girl slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Just relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around you is correct, no pets, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattresses.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he is asleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something rise from the belly?
Or is it with the face in front Directly in the mattress?
From this you can infer if everything is okay.
We have all grown up too and when my husband was born, it was a walk and there would be a place to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
So why are you offering me only $20?
Yesterday I wrote with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To put it plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It’s just that the policy of this broadcaster is now in full swing.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on big beg tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "a running column of litfass".
What are you now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A krogman who lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploding rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How to find all this well?
Great if you like it, I find it awful.
I ask for Rueckruf because my delivered wooden table has been delivered defectively.
Corps breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for cuddling – my little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for well-being heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and re-dispense it dosed.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they do not feel so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the cushion, check for unusual odor, stick or burning stains and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming up beforehand from the cover!
Warm in the microwave at 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (please note the manufacturer's information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first warm-ups, a slight formation of moisture can occur on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods of time or higher energy output can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for baby fit (max. 43 °C) on your armrest!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood clots and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
If you have pre-existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disorders, as well as a pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
Should seams have opened and loose nuclei emerge, discard the product and the loose nuclei immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinseries Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it also does not run under the third coach.
Jubilee in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful standout under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged through my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
False display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply plugged in.
After that, I expanded the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the power supply?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don’t know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
The 20-litre capacity also engulfs larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need for everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventional over the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling positions": there are 4 anchor beams, stably riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally differentiates the Everyday Backpack from others, photo backpacks: in addition to the cover flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to wander through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: when you take with you not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Convenient, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you want to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
Yesterday #NAME# sent me an email of confirmation for the commissioning of the
Contact is announced by the forwarding company to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't received a message so far.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one I came beyond the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it possible to see when the cabinet will be re-delivered?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me.
It's working.
Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please give me a call
If you extend the voucher, I will place a larger order immediately, but after all I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year went differently than I thought I could not imagine and I just could not redeem it in a timely manner and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the demands of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics that are specific to specific discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is guided by the balance of the disk according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, openings created increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic features of our tinted discs underline the character of each car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing lumps in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called California Gold Rush of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fast-growing and thriving cities of the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, you have to keep up with your resources and build a table that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional promotions or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
When a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lockdown!
This deactivates one half of the site – thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then players alternately perform actions such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the price booster rotates to a new location, thus changing the available actions.
This continues until the buyer has moved five times, so each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the players have to defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shot, then the final score is made.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a well-known guest in talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients: educators now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to handle.
And I am very grateful that many people nowadays think and act differently.
We, parents and other responsible people, must never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: countries advise on the abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated.
"We countries need clarity quickly on whether and when the test requirement for three vaccines can be waived," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chair of the Health Ministers' Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination stimulus," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very much, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you help me out?
I can no longer process a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page is on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under total anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, less often to seeing images and most rarely to perceiving pain.
C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the navel is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the pre-narcotic interview.
Certain anaesthetic procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment by me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The $20 doesn’t help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver outside the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I know of no person who can carry my heavy furniture on the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as a curator.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is also the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: “I have already witnessed my life’s gratitude here.”
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standard wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European space as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be collected
New York wins the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1-1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in the elfmeter shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was there at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I have come to taste and I want to cook rouladen for the first time at New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's going on now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it
IThis is about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>#NUMBER#
I was informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where there are still Christmas stews in the room Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck are among the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where you will find a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the slide content of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can be used to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
Further above, it already sounded like you can even float a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it comes out loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headphone or in direct recording, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you donate an additional VFS5 footswitch, you can also comfortably call the sounds on foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the correspondingly compatible effects.
This is really essential for live betting.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
I saw it that way in others.
Is there a way to send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If not, I would be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need are a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait is not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Deal Negotiations
Negotiations on a revitalization of the international nuclear agreement are progressing, according to Iran.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at the beginning there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The deal aims to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - now free state state with highest coronavirus incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the 1000 mark in the Corona incident on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990,5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 severely affected by Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery is only in early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and paste it on the package and send it to the post office, that was or?
I don't have to click/describe/fill anything here?
That’s exactly what I want to avoid, and that’s why I’m writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return shipping fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag you can find one thing: it is not extistent.
We have come into a winter stiffness and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what's it all about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we are in general.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here still have a lot of fun at the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The thrust came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found one, simply put, heaps of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way this project can continue to exist in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server where we can exchange information with each other and work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we act outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that’s not bad, we have the discord in the end.
If you have the time and the desire, come to the discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big / sticky for me and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversize, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, I will disassemble the cabinet but as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long do I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, nowadays she rarely eats meat.
I was a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I’ve always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I thought and understood that I would ultimately support animal cruelty as well.
So I decided to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was upset, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and how to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as a vegan quickly get stuck in a corner and conflicts arise without which you would not put it on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my returns on site.
Since I can’t be there because of a funeral, that can’t be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnstein Town Hall handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car water rescue of the volunteer fire department Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Lahnstein’s mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a constant expectation of increasing deployments: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure stream contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations after having synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I’m a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.

Thank you for standing up for the whole thing here for the first time, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, say we were also arms carriers in the executive, I do not want to go further!
The question of the right and left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, this should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in a special uniform and armored do not attract people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course with the lived reality difficult is of course also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't think about it in the ew)
But even if for the first time it sounds strange to me to have a conservative attitude, these marginal groups are proud of Germany and feel less overwhelmed by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks that it has to do well for them, they simply want to be treated as normal.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but that these can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who were often on foreign missions often start to package because of negative experiences and even sometimes say things that are controversial until politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certain times when right minded comrades meet who are engaged in a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
What I don't understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
but it was so confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but on top of the edge of the wood part are two deep notches that were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little leisure time), but all my life I get it more badly than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really like “someone could come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, although it disturbs me somewhere but mostly loses household simply against work and dislike.
The kitchen is cleaned more regularly as we like to cook.
Now, to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We haven’t done anything yet, and I’ve been working on this issue for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so doll, as long as no visit comes and for example there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen usable.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with a child or do you stay sluggish?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Pre-forming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on the arm and knee bends)

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fear-preventing) personality disorder.
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don’t have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I’ve been told many times that I look out of touch (which I think has improved).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the concrete working day is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find something about it on the Internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it drags me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already the simplest things screwed up") and I find it hard to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really" I need to know how to work with" / "I think of it" / "I really need to know how to work with it").
I will probably have the problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it at the time.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed by the feed decomposes the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual proteins (amino acids) and builds up from them its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the regeneration of feathers in the murky bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this therapeutic administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One painted measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until the regeneration of the feather is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
A case has been filed with the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, in the statute, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your comments.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think, the only question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?
Urgent report: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the connection point Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alarm of the police currently reports (14:03 a.m.), a car has come into the opposite traffic during the overtaking.
There are wounded.
Ah, okay, you understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking of everything you can think of.
Before I get out of here now... in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation – so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross starter.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don’t mention anything more specific here).
But it was all too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could make me more enjoyable.
At some point I landed at the teacher's office and was sure it was - even though the framework conditions are considerably more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only been half a year.
With the paintings before that, I have always decided to move on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
It’s holidays now, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday evening was my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in the moments.
Now the family party itself is too stressful for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically it is fun and from the outside the ref is also running well as far as feedback and so on.
But I’m completely exhausted and wondering how much stress my body can endure before it completely shuts down – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some posts from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, because where I was valued, I could take my free time if I needed it, and the work was somewhat boring now, but for that I didn't find the time was appropriately paid as a single case and the team was in what it was.
But then I wonder if I didn’t get back to the same place in a year and am dissatisfied.
You see, it’s all kind of wrong, but maybe as an outsider you’ve got advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, which I’m completely done with and I’m almost starting to cry at the slightest thought of it.
I’m not going to make decisions emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me at first.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the tearful undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become clear at least a little bit.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly mimics the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just sprout.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet newly added sound requirements, which has again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity can be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and string stop, and a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that above all the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic series of defeats in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also customizable: with three individually foldable velcro splitters, it fits the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-foreign things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L is also a great choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: Probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
The eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dared not predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava.
This corresponds to nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cooled lava.
Banana cultivation, which is extremely important for the island, was severely affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crisp tension something seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "society treaty of natural peoples", can be evaded with rigid routine and in the context of this life.
How the Christ Child Became from Nicholas
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, gifts were handed out on St. Nicholas Day in one way or another.
The background of this custom, still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows in one night in order to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional type of gifting came the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as “holy worship.”
For these reasons, they protect themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the Christian child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it is only annoying to the least that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the use of Martins with Martinssingen and Martinsförgning, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyful quarrel over who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christian child appears on Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, which is basically a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabled creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull their sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near Royal Palace
A gunman was shot dead by police near London's Kensington Palace on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who reportedly went to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly after by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The luminaire is easy to install and can be anchored with 2 earth spikes in the floor.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully inside.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light shine fascinatingly – optionally in white or colored light (in equal six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic roundings fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself large amounts of preparatory work: as a solar light, Smart Stone does not need any wiring or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" in any place in the daylight.
Two supplied earth spikes provide a firm hold if needed.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At breaking dusk, “Smart Stone” starts to glow automatically; in which color, you determine for yourself: Just six attractive light colors are your choice – in addition to daylight white.
The switching off also happens automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I’ve done this many times before, it doesn’t work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly severe pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again, because through chronic diseases I already have to take enough medications that I can not choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 during my last about two-year break and these everywhere.
As far as superficial, but it has burdened me very well and I did not feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time around.
My cosmetics are perfume-free and without Gedöns, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Dear skin is not such a thing.
Had pre-buperterial severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-area lumps and the acne topic.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of disease and I have stayed on low sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you want to have a construction site, you also prefer not to go looking for what is otherwise still wrong.
I already had all her colleague semina o. ä.
I wrote and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I have to work all the time in between and on the phone and then all of a sudden everything was gone...
what's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But it is generally in large

110-kV ground cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The Lower Bavaria government’s plan-making decision clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast near the town of Edermanning near Reut.

All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A good start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained this several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the entire sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken

Ref: Class Planning (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently still have big problems planning my lessons in the field of geology time efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geologists).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and with me, in fact, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
And so are the worksheets.
Maybe a geographer can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I'd really love it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already opted for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to finish the returns as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about revenue breakdowns.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of non-daily-needed items, revenue breakdowns are to be complained about, HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negative for the rest of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
“What really should be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without ground,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only works well in food retail as well as online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G in shopping is not going to take us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations terrified customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all stores with the received volume on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail - as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested).
The real estate group specializing in shopping malls, Deutsche Euroshop, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business,” CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high staffing and administrative effort, attempts are made for the centers to find and get solutions approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, where "visitors, for example, at a central point in the center, once provide their 2G proof and afterwards - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a bug, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already wrapped it back in the package and glued it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities ensures the setting of the lamp's color temperature and brightness.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire generates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker free.
The radiant angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work either on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach areas.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Also there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply by pressing one of the storage keys is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when new switches are switched on - Very convenient for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the ability to operate with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester the same as built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right one on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp with electricity continuously via the supplied power supply.
The installation of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The slope can be reliably adjusted by means of fixings on both sides.
It has been noted that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
It is also great that a bag is included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in a series of unbeaten Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga draw.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour shot the frustration over a grown-up season start from the soul, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today", cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke of a "pauschal praise, to everyone, who was with.
At first, it looked like a new damper for the now ranked nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners 2–0.
What happened then impressed the SGE trainer as well.
"Then the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continues.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defending player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch again for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his muscle injury, emphasized the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top form.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next on Wednesday, during the English week, an outside game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) is on the program.
Grade I receive the email that my package will return to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
I would say to myself that I will not order again because it has been a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Women's handball cushion ahead of quarterfinals against Spain
Germany’s handball women sneak up on Denmark after humiliation with their heads hanging and empty looks from the floor.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers suffered a hefty defeat and now has to run against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said German coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game of all that we have to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to reach the semi-finals, against the second World Cup of 2019 on Tuesday, a significant increase must come in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was back-room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - not in the attack, not in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward now."
From the front to the back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on the height with the punch.
Wrong throws and technical failures in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 backstop after seven minutes.
Only Torwife Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick confrontation.
However, this was not the expected initial inflammation.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand up - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
Thus, the game was run at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since back-fielder Mia Zschocke saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to play again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection came a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals were scored.
The already quiet hope of a chase after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener defenders in all areas sinned and made it easy for the well-rounded opponent, who is among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer expect an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the floor.

The title suggests that I work as a vaccination practitioner in mobile vaccination teams in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be completed in large part, then partly continue in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions with no time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as these are not related to a personal one (e.g. "I take medication X, this is tolerated with vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility is the education for the vaccination, the position of indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Coronavirus Regulation and no reasons to say otherwise), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (it has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but they cannot carry out vaccinations (can?), so I carry out most of the vaccinations myself there.
Serious "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "sleeper"?
With this dialect answer, sent by an Amberger, the BR TV show "Wir in Bavaria" has provided for intense reflection.
However, unlike in many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" this time remained undisclosed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "who has to go fast."
That, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
Which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably caused surprises in many Upper Palatinate.
"The skin cleaner," the spectators heard, "is a cloth with which someone sweeps the oven."
Dialectical researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar oral word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also among many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after the confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing's helped.
Tyre selection on a racing bike – is it really that pan-safe?
This morning I woke up with a lot of urgency, because I wanted to train at least a little more in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) lays out.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud chirping and my rear tyre did not want to participate in the rest of the track at all.
Since I didn’t have a real chance to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around again with half a bad mood and take the first best train home.
It wasn’t that bad, maybe it’s better if I practice it again with the change of tyres before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike until 14: 120km!) and who had already called them suboptimal, because he has been riding with them for several years.
But when I think about having to change tyres after 80-90km, I think I’m really in a bad mood :D
Now I’ve had a conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unflattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I don’t want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40/tyre now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tyres when riding a race bike?
The Schwalbe page seems to me to be absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car hits tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an undisclosed cause and then hit the countercarriage, police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then thrown against a tree and the man was clamped in the car.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get a new generation.
SOLO 15 is called the new sprinkler and is visually reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed foot is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but the sound is intended to reach an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably adult and for her size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high pitch.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the greatly increasing bundling at too high frequencies.
Exactly oriented to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outwards, the high pitch range can be reduced, making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimum stereo triangle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to first think about the final look of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to furnace the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the furnace again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction shop), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a top milling machine, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flat later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto them.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if required, if, for example, you want to use ready-made bars from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second page is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable circular saw or a forester drill, the mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting clamp on the back wall, is facilitated.
A round milling machine is then used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded with this.
Subsequently, the foot plate is glued firmly with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking / blowing out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In this case, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is guided to the speaker opening and is also loosely suspended there.
Subsequently, the frequency deviation is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency gap, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document:
If the frequency gap is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, then the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm baSSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
Due to the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, it is possible to check the sealing accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus wire (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
Hello to all of you,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per channel, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
