Victory of populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have, according to the first approximate results, brought an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have been suffered by the Austrian People's Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously wobbled.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, thus losing 5.5 percent of votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse yet, the OVP lost 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about the resignation of the party president and, to this day, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be reached this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would evidently facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would be repeated in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a united party) government (but in 2005 BZO was generated).
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to get to parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four per cent limit and is therefore not a member of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
Failure to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be reached," he said after the meeting held on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly get into legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was released from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, the best would be, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Then he can request the exoneration of the case and wait in freedom for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague spoke in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convict a "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that this kind of support is already available to him from the Indian side.
“We have the utmost interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, before her colleague she insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a terrible mistake to imprison and convict these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would take care of the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, which depicts Australia surrounded by the sea.
It is not interested, however, in the continent but a small lost point in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its head, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exposition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the mainland
The countries with coastlines have begun today to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty these take advantage of the rights that they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Rim which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Rim.
"Simply, by continental edge is meant the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under water.
It reaches to the edge of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Border continent, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of works.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only those of the last three countries mentioned have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, so did New Zealand – the seabed area awarded by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, nearly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gains that will result from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They may do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the Continental Rim ends, the ocean floor region declared by the Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is no gold mine,” says Director Mikulka, adding “that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and their regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
"An area of a total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan said.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was at the scene of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for the help of Germany – the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Therefore at the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokespersons reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as her 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the rescued people safely arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus of the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first chamber of the United States Congress failed with little a large $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected by 227 votes to 206 the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince the critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations had asked the deputies to make a vote although the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investors’ concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turmoil in the international financial markets.
To allow the program to enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As Germany’s travel association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
So the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar, especially travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased by almost a third.
The preferred destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case the travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, comparing last year, fell.
It's my first Oktoberfest.
The hits of the parties under the open sky in the endless Spa, the beer in one-liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on television and wears a custom-made traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that binds us together: as soon as we are in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in a traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seems to be heeding or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side she is engaged, behind she is a widow."
Oh God, now I'm buckling from the back to the left.
“Okay,” he says laughing.
The others don't care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their knotted ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
To him it looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after putting next to his glass of a liter of beer he just drank.
He put it right next to the fire hydrant, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others aren’t very lucky and can’t consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, groups of sanitaries run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunkards.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered tents from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
It is not possible to see who suffers from alcohol levels and is on the sidelines.
“They’re the ones who “can’t do it anymore,” a health care professional gave me the answer by answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred at Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey intended to become a member of the European Union, the European powers nestled the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is laid out at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office is over, there is no doubt about the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East via this railroad that was cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under the control of the Soviet Union.
When the forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been decaying and has been left out of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, foreign policy expert, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shaking, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has raised some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The objective of the party’s foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to face that election."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken so far had recited almost by heart: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States, as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to the Hydarpasha station, after a second night without sleep, my thoughts turn to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt in which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (skeleton, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its ending in 1979, several of us were ending our 20s - just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifting being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, regardless if unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this young choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
We just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, although never imposing, nor too florid.
Whatever the music, it always ended on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any one, been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve been inspired by them many times.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two well-known war horses around the world.”
We will miss you very much.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25), he states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate."
This is learned in a note by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a scholarship from Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and life" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was struck by their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample habitability, this new minivan features an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics are among the highlights.
However, before analyzing the new model it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where the Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Jazz units have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a compact five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company expects to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of the Insight will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The trunk capacity – which features a double-bottom system – is up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the trunk capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 revolutions.
This powertrain - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has an expenditure of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous thruster, which in the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now it passes to have 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horsepower achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance in the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, general manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to reinforce the collision-prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most importantly are the bee’s composite eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the escape maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with just a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes.”
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Tremble Before Mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or trouble.
The grim aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
True, it has useful information, but not very detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells stake in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market.
A week after discovering an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at the unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a banking holding company,” said Juan Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow it to diversify its activities but it passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more prudently than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $ 8.5 billion.
"A week ago," explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG in Tokyo, "we thought that the stake would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we have wished to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares if these shares are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had greatly eased its balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market price fall in half as the cost of security against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost was falling last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other single “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks following the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the “yes”, estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had assured, congratulating Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution entailed an increase in the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the " development planning " of a country which lived essentially on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and on the foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants the head of state reinforced powers, which can serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo’s international airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and they killed half of the kidnappers, the others have fled," said this official who kept the anonymity.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an off-road vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them, including the Chadian chief, and detaining two.
It also claimed that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unit (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate about the financing of culture has made headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
It's better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in your Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Quebec Federation of History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people grouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money heaps of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and managers throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a portion of Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros this financial and insurance institution that also has businesses in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Head of Economic Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis of the Eurozone in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with regard to the Bank, in a certain sense can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken early on Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank will surely sell a part of its business, among them mainly the activities -mainly insurance- bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow it to fail.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current share prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp drop in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the U.S. market in relation to the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new chief executive.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they did not have to worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic has occurred among the Bank’s clients so far, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see the data on the purchase of medicine.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the prescriptions in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because otherwise, “we trust the fox the chicken coop” – quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the health status of the client and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical check-up and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the check-up.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the illnesses and health status of the customer.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is practically incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even set a risk number, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has barely anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multi-purpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, require the patient's approval.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently compiled the results of laboratory exams and combined with drug consumption data, they obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So hens, despite everything, are exposed to the fox’s goodwill.
Global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, focusing on cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, member countries have yet to come to a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President, and Javier Solana, Chief Foreign Policy Representative, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase to more than one hundred billion euros, their trade.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this way, the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally harmonised, so that air transport could also fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as at next year’s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and production of greenhouse gases should be cut by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of cultural goods and activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the ceremony of inauguration of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
An encounter with the print will follow at the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-meter high plateau in the Mammoth Lakes area of the Nevada Mountains on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson said: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance."
No human remains have been found in or around the plane.
The 63-year-old millionaire was reported dead in February.
The American office for the safety of transports (Ntsb) has announced that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squadron of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had conquered a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world’s spin in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flying.
Three years later he had made the round the world by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An out-of-schemes SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" off-road vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Own by the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out outside the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival's fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these of Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and of Apulia.
They have three-color flags where the militants’ hometown appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to the Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) at that time, none that had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of stadium crime, have been denied tickets and travel.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the incoming acts of the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents attending not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put any more foot in a stadium.
Thankfully!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others should be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the interior ministry said.
Therefore, "eyes wide open" especially in view of the match of the National Wednesday in Lecce".
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is to say the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was formerly of Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste Public Safety where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I do not play the sociologist - adds the Observatory No. 1 - the crimes are attributed in the countries in which the fact happens.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will consider it for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: these too are not a crime, but if you allow them, they are not educational either.”
