Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison over the alleged signing of a deal with Russia that disadvantaged Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeals court has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for its approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a matter of elucidating whether they are moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator’s person, society, composed of warring tribes, will be united by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit, on the other hand, the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it does not cease to be surprising that the Islamic fighters accepted gratefully the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies manage to get the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia do not cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the quarter-to-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-to-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaping.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest rate on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is getting worse.
In Germany, there are rumours that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the qualifying with a 200 million bonus.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so they will not miss the European championship event.
IHNED.cz followed in detail the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so the coffers of the national football will get a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams just kept the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed at noon on Tuesday in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students on Tuesday formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked on.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon in front of the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then threw death slogans at the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, not only the Isfahan power plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: no sausage breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity affecting 5%.
Obese children come mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment in which one grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessed children eat sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had had chips for dinner the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children of Basic Education from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program “Obesity is not a coincidence”, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and enough exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed responded that they have five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results says.
No breakfast but sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households they do not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that families of obese children consume insane chips much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet soda daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed play sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make Your Diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“The popularity of sweet soda is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main meal, the pasta is taken from the palm and the poultry meat follows it closely.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating," the study results said.
Attention is drawn, for example, to sweet soda, where many children would start to prefer regular water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish for the main meal and restrict consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-shouldered, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the Jennifer Lopez type stand out, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a way that is too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is so great that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth having at least one extra piece of fabric sewn to measure.
No doubt you will not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly is priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can afford to wear clothing with pleats, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many kinds of various and body info, so I’m glad that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
We must take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately has gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them out of magazines or search the internet and print them, to then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is how the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (on specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this was told to us by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all of this is up for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists animated Saturday’s conference with information on all types of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
In this case, variability is essential.
Thus, such a trench coat can be dressed in the classic way with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves and climb up your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you must first know all the rules."
“Then you can break them,” Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what combines with why, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to wear, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills suffice, my physical appearance does not matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a size very different from their real (minor).
Then it only remains to gossip and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not just oriented in fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During your work, above all you should communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with beautiful garments, you can't take and throw away everything that was and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend for someone to wear,” Mario says.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the labor market.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clips for hooking clothes in front, if this was larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a set of stitching.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and even more so the exterior.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skillful.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don't really have those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a path of roses, but I don’t care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you compete all over America.
Review
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper neglects of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent, expectations were met, but that was of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added, aroused great expectations already before its release.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what is shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre again without more.
We are also curious to know how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total counting points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumnal landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
In the mountains, however, you must be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of opponents (normal in a classic race), then you try to win time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that nowadays it is no longer a big thing, but you can not say that it is bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with enough action is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correctness of driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games of this type you can not expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled spins.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no major problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resettings are programmed in such a way that, when you have an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very trustworthy.
Sometimes, even resetting does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage from memory.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the "surprise" will always happen in front of your noses.
The opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, whatever the price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front, so at first you can make the car dough.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed right away.
And it’s a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so that it doesn’t fit boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas supplies next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for urban areas, the American strong cars for straight highways and the exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both the challenges and the stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is done.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (passe), where you start to run in the dark along the tracks (passe).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the subway convoy and is carried in front of you without further ado.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or whether the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where there are many participants involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the "each of his father and mother" category, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for its music.
Need for Speed: The Run is a bit confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly errors, we would have trouble stating that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of some airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenova, began her conference at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenova also weighed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is the criticism, that if it's insulso, a gray official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of Foreign and Security Policy Representative is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of the political union in the face of states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenova has also dealt with the agenda followed, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis, and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good fuss", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU’s seven-year budget, caused by the current much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which will receive the least support?
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
“The truth is that I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreigners or slang that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to prohibit us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies in a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, are you in the Visegrad Group?’
In the future, according to Vicenova, the EU will be awaiting tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new one of the "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, that they stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of two speeds," Vicenova is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU should be debated among member states, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
Already he coined the motto that many problems in the world have solutions if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully crafted corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
This has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to thriving even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, current CEO of the company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared for his employees as the entrepreneur of Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
Already from the beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which infinity of future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are plenty of ideas, as the firm employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is familiarly known in the U.S. because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and web hosting programs, infrastructures and services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year it has become the second tech firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t emotionally anchor yourself in the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and still, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And this is the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and one-fifth equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performing assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has increased stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be hoped that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM’s History: From the Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It possessed inventions such as the famous "clock to record", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competitor company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader overshadowed the IBM founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and the company’s massive expansion across continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consultancy part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet”.
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example, in relation to transport and city administration.
For the retail sector, IBM recently unveiled the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire trading cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her mistress, Darina remained hopeful that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore,” Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not leave the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old donkey who made a mistake, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far, Josef doesn’t care that his wife has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company is still in place, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we didn't share a bed," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t interest me, neither where she goes nor if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Josef concludes.
Women’s Worst Vices: Do They Also Refer to You?
If you ask men to be able to cite some vices typical of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapeze a week?
Do you like to shop often on sale?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just walk around the clothing stores, look for tight-fitting clothes and then try them all on in the dressing room (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a pastime, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner to better wait for you outside the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
“I would need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?”
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases sound to you?
Isn't that right?
So she's one of those women who's obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust off, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for having stepped on the floor clean with a dirty foot, your children for having soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that you had a hard time cleaning?
In case you suffer from this “deviation,” try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the floor!"
If you do those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Naturally. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also like slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps every one of us sometimes misses a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who are not controlled, who love to gossip and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and puts Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and took it one step further and was declared best player of the game.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jagr's teammate, Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the game, I told him I would triple.”
"I introduced him."
"Sometimes they look like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, in the wake of the Flyers' first run.
A while later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trail.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek took the disc behind the goal of the Hurricanes and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds' quarter goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean to say he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly among the top three," Jágr told his central.
“I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
"I'm very pleased with it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr adds.
Carolina even turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again Dwyer's penalty, until he got a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up outnumbered two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has placed itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a two-goal gap, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were rookies."
“Well, but there’s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the disc out of our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty wins to Winnipeg's 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold in most cases only trips to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and Czech tourist trips were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies in those times also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The Czechs’ way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware, that the currently favourite destination, Croatia, could not be travelled freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa waivers were imposed for travel to neighbouring Western European states, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see themselves fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income back then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or board.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned food, sausages, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech krona, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare travel using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volume.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs were traveling visa-free to almost every developed country except the U.S., which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and hot countries. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15,000 CZK on travel abroad per head, including expenses on the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up deadlocked again.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be thrown by the Executive Committee, which, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moorish side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Astonishingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees with this, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
“I would like the vote to be as much as possible in accordance with the statutes.”
"So that no nonsense about representatives is invented as at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and so cooperation will be more comfortable," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
"Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts whether the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sporting organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sport Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, knew before the Extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not be a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a right person, I would be fighting for him and not run for election.”
“But to this day we have not been able to find such a person,” Paclík told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Paclík also points out that, in case of victory, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people that I might be able to keep in mind.”
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What supposedly annoys Paclík most right now is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
“In case he wins, the current status will be maintained and nothing in football will change.”
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his earlier statement that "I would sell Pilsen club if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday’s election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, the other candidate, Rajchl, has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
“I also don’t put my nose where I don’t feel capable,” added Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Referees’ Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, who was later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
Since last summer, he has also been the Director of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated its victory in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etinsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it was putting pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be addressing."
“If they raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going,” he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself states that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"Not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically giving up my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the stalemate of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve, in the future, the disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do him well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People of all levels have been involved in football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new president on Thursday."
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win over the delegates.
“If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
“He’s been in the football world for over a year, and he’s already achieved some success.”
"His attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
“That’s why many of them doubt their true character,” Pelta told his opponent, who remains faithful to statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a football promotion showcase.
"I would also try to resolve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov, who, after a long period of anarchy, is understandably nervous.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are foretold before the next general assembly, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get over it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working eagerly.
If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to solving the Bohemians’ case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, raising more money for football and continuing the work started by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football.”
"From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, to professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"This is not to say that I would do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies in such a way that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people probably won’t like this, because it will mean starting to work really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
“Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so as not to give up like that, no more,” he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he has already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work was done that I don’t want to miss now.”
"There are processes that have been started and that will take effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said worried that, if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's time.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few."
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my utmost for Moravia."
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division.”
“It wouldn’t be the current situation where we only have three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few tens of millions of kroner from disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt in the fact that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he sees the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that to my advantage," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Leap to the Blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in water.
When Iris Meder took a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swam towards the marble angels, who awaited her on the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored Modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with the sport, Meder says, only the water is different.
It only annoys him that bathing enthusiasts have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or hear the cheerful trills of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal sauna oils. The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor pools can be a real gift for the eye: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is bent optically: the high vaults, the colorful tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about architecture and the history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, above all, it gives a desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, the nitrate waters are located in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as spas, whose pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbery).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city lays eyes on Zurich’s roofed pool, you can look at snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The water cathedral in <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise into the sky.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not invading the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many hot springs smell of sulfur, in the baths of <0xC3><0x81>rpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain baking soda and alkali and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she came across blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
As Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, he saw the undergrowth grow among the tiles.
Decay counteracted in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the times of its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall of the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural to the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to fuse different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the commodities business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank quitting its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents say Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions should pull out of the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges raises prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer ombudsman’s campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was designed to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from U.S. competitors: He vowed to revise the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently harming the public welfare.”
Ackermann stands as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which the money for food price bets is at stake,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation he can perfect his image.
And he needs to be scarcely concerned about possible losses, that is what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on Nov. 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were bet.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agrarian speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and would switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, became empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate about clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the following world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the South Station in Vienna, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th-century museum was opened, it was called the "House 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation of the same name are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore, and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current renovations there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed, and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected from rust.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The "Brussels-born" pavilion has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that is why he wanted to “awaken the right conscience”.
In this case, the house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened an urban luck. The completely new and planned "central station district", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as you can hear, is negotiating with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train failures in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
What it costs millions.
In the fight against train failures and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For which a better availability of the vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train broke an axle at Cologne central station.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA recriminates many large banks inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to reimburse the losses of millions caused.
The agreements currently closed are its first type.
The regulator had also called other major banks to account and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to doom for many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has filed the largest number of lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a lawsuit from the FHFA, it is about businesses worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the forecasts of long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investments have soared to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM had so far learned nothing about the compromise.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services as the operation of computing centers.
The over 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s publicly traded shares rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is revived again.
The murders of eight tricky and Greek small businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin there has been a reaction with fear and concern at this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was long believed to be dead returns, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving again?" headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Constitutional Defense and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend remembered the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, reflected on a solemn act marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap in the face: “The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary,” says the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X,” referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not searched for suspects in the far-right circle long before.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on it is lost here, the immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armaments."
“This will be the best self-protection.”
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network," Selen writes.
Which means that, if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the deficiency of German politics in the aftermath of the attacks was criticized, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated based on the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media reports once again show how profound the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has since been.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
Europe’s riskiest bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
Axel Weber hadn’t thought of it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of directors of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly-acquired solidity, and makes kind remarks about his future colleagues.
“USB has achieved a revitalization.”
"I am delighted to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board of directors has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber is expected to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
He suddenly takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title "the biggest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, discreet and solid, but also clever, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "In front of my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was regarded as a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard of.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 in the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
“We can’t bail out UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in asset management through tax fraud aid.
And just as it was getting calmer again, just as it was thought that UBS was getting it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
"With the Adoboli case it is clear that the risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls."
So came the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers have long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the world’s greatest assets: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only slightly larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry stores such as Tiffany’s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he believes, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up with it?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different precursor banks of UBS: a rich but dormant bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: The misguidance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the company advisers in charge highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the language of “fixed income” banking, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in American high-risk investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgage loans and then selling them, holding certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks sought the downside for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than expected.
The positions at UBS became projectable seats and are insecure to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a job almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea, end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must shrink a lot, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: He must run UBS’s business permanently, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-nineties.
Abolition of 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that surely Axel Weber is asking himself right now.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The looming recession in Europe has frightened American investors earlier in the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain without force.
Curbed industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a crisis caused by debt at its origin.
General relief might not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Janney Montgomery Scott’s Mark Luschini.
First and foremost, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Standards Index closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
The companies produced in September two percent less than the previous month, as reported by the statistical office of Eurostat.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: "We're not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot free itself so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws overboard a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the market trend at first just a percentage higher.

Smart Grids Spread in Cities
In many places grease is considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, say the experts.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grelos have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the crap and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Grains no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first Grails Symposium in Leer, East Friesland.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the countryside of certain protected grease; chemical applications in agriculture visibly wipe out traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the falling of trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
Grays are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district’s fats made headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and banishing them in a normal way does not achieve anything," said Werner Klöver, a city planner and landscape designer from Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
Fleeing them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to re-settle elsewhere.
Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a beak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Grass Teaching Circuit, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms of the bird noise: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grelos not only take advantage of resources to access shale bites, but they make tools to use as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grails how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone onto a platform in order to reach a moth larvae.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning grease had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket in the shooter of the tube.
Three of the four grails did it on the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the first leg, made the five consecutive appearances in the Euro.
The Czechs scored 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs return game with outsider Montenegro, after in the first leg (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia did not let it be scored in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic scored a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started off perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct free throw from more than 30 meters to get ahead in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his ability to score from a distance and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, leader of England's Manchester City sent a header to the bat, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scored for the Czech Republic
Then Ergolding colleague Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark punched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal by Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth time in a row for the Euro.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also got lucky and had to overcome a reaction second in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflex a possible goal on own goal of Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the lap of the front, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's crossbar from the world-famous goalkeeper, the striker of FC Seoul escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the marvel of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his seat on the third bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream beginning.
In the seventh minute, with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan was only able to touch the post.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made way for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Eurocup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, which triumphed 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a previous decision, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) drew with the hosts.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane had his first big shot.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he got ahead of it.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting the 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015 approximately two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will circulate, the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
“We will get more facilities for research and development and we will hire workers,” Bill McDermott, co-chairman, told a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalián.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are headquartered in the country of the boom.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s strategy for 2012.

"Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through broad instruction."
Massacres on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers, and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War was only the disastrous trench war on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" expertly moves through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book are hit by hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
“Lack of facts,” observes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
“The Beauty and the Pain of Battle” follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the offshore fleet.
His stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small moments, missing details.
Many of these are about deprivation and dealing with it.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl she says: "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he notes, “837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own impulse toward savagery and states about war: “You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy breastplate.”
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you’re resigned to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly resembling “a convict being secretly strangled.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent, ideologically convinced mass murderer in finely crafted clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a prostitute’s venereal disease as a way to evade service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embitter their genitals with in the hope of ending up in hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness.”
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he reflects the way the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels such as No Novelty on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund’s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, ripped from your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault by the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen on the night of Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the “squatters.”
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye facing Zuccotti.
The agents stepped up so-called disorder training — counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district — dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said a lot of people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages rumbling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters just picked up their things and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent the police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated harshly by the officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west through the protesters’ dense tangle of personal belongings, including bags and garbage bags crammed with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp locked their arms to each other.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called in to cut off the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “disruption of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief detective, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union will sue the city for layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, Municipal District 37, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a town hall hearing last month, education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One council member counter-attacked by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school's support staff members would be fired.
Officials from the 37th municipal district said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that they would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been chronically insufficiently subsidized.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. District 36’s budget fell by 3.26% this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for every poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a job exchange, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," the draft complaint says, "and not just in surplus."
Mission over, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the U.S. involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — with Congress annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee’s top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually gets a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations from one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that “will control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes — a chance to boast that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be overturned if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beating but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his ABC News appearance "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back to the House by surprise to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked how he was feeling, Giffords, 41, responded, “Very well.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long “20/20” special, which aired on the eve of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program looked at Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen on her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A movement of the head.
A frown of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted," a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more pity than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines burst into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them as some kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really. It was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes worshipping American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they feel sorry for those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are conducted quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling her children.
Military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Battlefield achievements are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Army Faces Growing Pressure to End Rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for its alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded a warning signal,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's big plan, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have been killed and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are pending besides hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service — a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the aggressions are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, it amounts to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant — from a cut in her arm — was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "" That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment. ""
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case filed by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move on.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that responsibility poses.
And he adds: "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way salespeople have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry at immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “likes,” wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is driving a research boom, driving the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken deeds on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and step in to help a student who posts too many status updates with their drunkenness.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “clicking” on its own population to get data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the election turnout expectation midway through the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using information that can be accessed – digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make their vast amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with Facebook’s public walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a tech researcher, Selwyn believes that a paperclip and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik Makes First Public Appearance in Court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I’m a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he told a crowded room of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it was mandated by organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because “I didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of advancing towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhuman,” one survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge ruled he is not a mentally ill man, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I’d like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it looked like it."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview Showed At A Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a designer, dreamer, and self-recognized hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flowchart yoki — a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds over the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during her transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly re-released footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost 68-minute Interview, which hits Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers — from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years in the business, I always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes into detail his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done at a glance, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine retail commercial costs.
The Joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and you yelled through the pay phone and then came back a minute later to the pay phone next door,” Jobs says with a chuckle.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost leave, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode-ray tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a ride to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and it was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?”
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up leading companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly is rotten by the fault of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
Innovation as an Artistic Expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work going on between a great idea and a great product...as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make electrons do, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all boils down to taste – it boils down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to tailor those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas Dine with Health Care Law Rivals as Court Accepts Case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama’s challenge to the health care law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were groomed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit the lawsuit to trial and, in fact, a historic 5-and-a-half-hour pleading is expected by March, and the outcome is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision is known.
The attorney who will appear in court and argue that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees included, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner, Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under Canon Code 4C, which says, “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive breach of ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to the lawsuits of several magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were harassed at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say mix too easily the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’ wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will do so.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is it news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place from where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft by its dollar value - 50 Boing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts spectacular fuel savings and passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The UAE order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep at bay its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger jet.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Shares of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the gubernatorial contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the state's violent election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They seized the ballot boxes, they installed barricades... and they ordered the people to vote” in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly overtaken Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, came in third place, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as Michoacán’s elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
AfDB Urges Asia to Help Rescue Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would hamper the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC countries looking at Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it can’t be immune.”
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India is going to do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when facing their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that Greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and going on vacation to the beaches and that won’t do well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greece’s numerous, well-paid public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warnings of Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and spark a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily remove many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to dismiss civilians in order to meet the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the goodwill.”
The cuts over time would hit combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime funding in the overseas contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by severe disruptions in baseline budgets,” Panetta warned.
"The hiring of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war."
"Payment staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The aftermath of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would result in a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not an outcome that we can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgeting in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta lays out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delays in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously engaged worldwide; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could tackle the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it’s the vital next step to improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “caught” with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a mockery of his denials quickly rebuffed by the irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps are widespread in school and college exams.
There have been cases where teachers have given test replies to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure enough, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim, “I have you,” deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the findings of the research is that the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look into the eyes.
They do not always stutter, babble, blush or restlessly.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, questioning, and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, handling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more “self-oriented lies,” while women tell more “other-oriented” lies—usually to protect someone’s feelings—that married people lie less frequently to their partners than people who aren’t married (but the lies they tend to tell tend to be “self-oriented”).
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps to provide benchmarks to measure changes afterwards.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally kicks with their foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when they see their feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body while trying to remember their story, can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit “post-interview relief” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely make it appear that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up and used past time while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman...Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone may use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted following threat of US delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — infuriating unions while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit on a different route.
This follows last week’s announcement by the State Department that they would delay the decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
"This is a real path of progress," Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, although officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed their full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada-hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who served as Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her little daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when trampoline rider Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk descended to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to get her,'" she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left her daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle on me.”
She said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" said the girl's mother.
LaBelle rushed over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and withdrawn to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a supportive association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it’s directed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s administration, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-described change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing million-dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic drop of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53% of the Economically Active Population.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What you're seeing is a rise in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who take dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work them, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloa labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there is the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled 630,697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143,312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.28 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be destined to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés’ government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to direct the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and the economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guides the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He was convicted of 8 kg of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the narco-nudist sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of Post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomanudist was riding in a pick-up truck, white color, where he carried a black bag in the box of the vehicle and in the seat of the co-pilot a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was left at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced continues to be interned in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Owes contributions to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The municipal director of Social Development indicated that although so far the work programmes have progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the corresponding contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force.
"They are almost 12 million what they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not contribute at that time the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to move forward, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages corresponding to them arrive as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Court validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree that details the actions to be taken to concretize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and it translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the change, he said, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision in the public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, invades in some way the sphere of competence of the Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" counting in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PrEP the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,074 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,074 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
As will be remembered, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided in the Law of the Official State Gazette, with the object of
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state president to the constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the assumptions that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no act of scrutiny and computation in the file of the box or does not work in the power of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the election in question and the one who obtained the second place in the voting, is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the candidates.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the ordinary counting it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, in which case the electoral packages that have been subject to partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PrEP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16%, although not counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during which reconnaissance and a requiem mass were held.
According to his relatives, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute from the side of the other people killed in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to enter the Colegio del Aire in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just as he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his family’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.

Three bodies found abandoned in Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the verge of economic disaster.
Designated Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, far less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain shattered confidence in Italy.
Stressing pressure on Monti to hurry, volatile markets put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic-majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his grudges at a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 footballers named from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 convened reached the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 called by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rank, count a wide record of A-class interselection games, the Tricolor has only defender Michael Umaña as the only one who has the 50 international matches.
That figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain a yearly intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Euro and the World Cup of football.
Ticos, on the other hand, have a limited international friction in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish national team is the goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain flyer, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 performances in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest aren't close to 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain's all-time top scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more numbers with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country on its tour celebrating two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them too will turn into reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and will make its only stopover in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
That day they will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is at The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are living through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’re going to be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely the days before.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for standing by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We’re really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they’ve been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and are very excited that we can continue making music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It’s always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a move comes from a group of friends and it’s a rare occurrence.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it’s much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours will stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give freedom to each one to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t be too touring because it’s easy to fall for that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you should respect the music and what it brought, without infatuation with being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it’s no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came out at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that maybe feel lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated four times and which remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official entourage, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information in all that is political affairs between the two nations", as published by the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has presided since November over the G20, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had it done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," Nintendo's head of specialized press in Spain, Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible" that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once passed, the more experienced will be able to give a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting in that the plumber of the mustache will have to travel platforms mined of dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has extradited former ruler Alfonso Portillo to the United States to answer for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision is due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his tenure he “did not get his hands on” judicial decisions and gave way to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
The move by Colom is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the former president from 2000 to 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has solved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process leading up to extradition, but the Public Prosecutor’s Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
To this is added the hundreds of jobs currently obtained for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of graduation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former socialist education councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà.
Also attending the large hall of La Fabra i Coats were the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president cited Trinijove as an example for his ability to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted a squatted farm where macro parties were held
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51.
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street were living has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday noon the building they illegally occupied, and where they organized macrofiestas that desperately the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was finished, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
“From now on there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the farm were unfair competition, since they sold the drinks for three euros, while in the nightclub they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints for noise, while, she said, the inconvenience is not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and for nine months she "forgave" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civics that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivility that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours, police arrived at 35 rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some promotional posters for Collserola.
The pamphlet defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was once again positioned, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park results from this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
These were until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone else wants to put doors on the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation between all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme when two members of this ancient caste of elects recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelonan architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of green apples, has not been carried out.
“It’s important to start with the fact that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", judges the architect for whom the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": we must not think of them "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertain how it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on which it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, its overshoot.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters."
More constrained to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol believes that, simplifying, the Valais side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a purely topographical matter.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken bag", although it is grateful for the opportunity that the city council offers its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to create: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because the bases of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been called -says- in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of roots, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of the Casino Red granted him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is following a blackmail process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public denunciation, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panista mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and entrenched for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the State.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, enough evidence was found to determine Jonas’ guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the bookmaker’s representatives in exchange for allowing the operation of the bookmaker.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request the pardon for the brother of the regal mayor; so that in the next hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal process, the agent of the Public Prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter no claim can be made regarding the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to make reparation for damages or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal representative of the bookmaker, around 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that in the investigations made in the area of the impact there is no report of the appearance of pieces on the ground.
“A search reported that there are no parts or components of the craft elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff operated at cruising speed and that this happened on an ascending soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
In the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was made under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced towards the area bordering between the DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or disturbance in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of debris of the aircraft allows to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion was detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire is revealed in the remains of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mid-sea level, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along that path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned off site around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, reinforcing the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security Leads Research to Discover Obesity Gene in Children and Youth; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is leading research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity', which will allow us to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research the population is invited to participate, whether or not they are entitled, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out for minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico West) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Unidad Deportiva Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Unidad Deportiva Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is celebrated on November 14, the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on diet.
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
All participants are given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetics (we seek to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed," said the IMSS specialist.
He said the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the country’s population differs from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic disturbances and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors give it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high content of fats and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the potholes could be completely reduced or even eliminated.
In his lecture A Technological Opinion of Potholes, issued in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge of his development developed modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but that it is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt wallet, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
As vehicles travel and effort is generated, it allows forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On top of the asphalt binder, a last layer is placed called rolling binder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt binder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt binder.
When the soil is moistened, the water diffuses into the interior of the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear is the rolling film and only then the asphalt binder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is complied with, to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without using high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the scepter, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina has joined the legion of Vallecaucanas women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Marya Domínguez Borrero (1949), Garnía Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena <0xC3><0x81>lvarez (1979).
The big question many people are asking today is: What is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Police Queen and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Cart.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think that the book that marked me from childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that little liked first for the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotán journalist hinted that being the favorite, the cheered and the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on stage".
And that was noted in her first swimsuit performance at the Hilton Beach and her two coronation evening parades.
Although she looked safe in both, it was noticed that she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN's "Come at Home" program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen."
In addition, Valle was at last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
Two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered her points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here she was taken.”
For this award, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction emerged that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that from today Melina begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodged the crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist of the Cali CTI went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists who work in the sectional of the CTI, that week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to stay for more than five days in the jungle to get to the place where the corpses that had to be identified were.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and of the feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the decadactile card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the FARC’s chief.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typewriter from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know about our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Aside from identifying corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identities of those captured.
When caught, many criminals present fake banknotes or have no papers.
We took their fingerprints and looked them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also dismiss or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective collation is performed.
‘Indignants’ defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter the Manhattan Square from which they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded outside Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order allowing the "outraged" to return to camp on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the “outraged” response to the eviction from his camp dictated personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already traveled in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters moved there carried and distributed at this time copies of that court order and even gave them to the agents who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes", Bray said, who denounced that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were “violating the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", since "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression."
"Occupy Wall Street" officials also said they planned to organize "major actions" by Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two-month-long protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen’s assistant on “Home Improvement,” first responder on “Baywatch,” “Playboy” bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "Crooner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 as a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires to Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan resurfaces after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the country since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates put material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: the GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter – for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – is also the fastest pace of growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has turned to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the turbulent US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let its guard down.
"We must be aware of the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates tipping points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing.
Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area even stood below the average, which is at the 100th level, with a fall of eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives won't sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty reinstalled on the parquet floors, Greece continues to get entangled in the maze leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the civil servants’ disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have committed to nothing else.”
The conservative leader stepped a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek steak still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she said lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "especially, in the one that has as goal the reduction to half the volume of people living with incomes below a dollar of poverty, with the daily dollar fixed."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is posited not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push “two basic goals”.
His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will leave the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The momentum in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasizes Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all of them I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, he argued that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit is "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Union by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too unstrict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and ten abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes won by Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Finance Minister, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to pave the way in Europe".
This could manifest itself in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble’s idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive against the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither has she tried to win over her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the struggling countries willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the grants, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a bank responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the issue, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day’s leave of absence on private sector workers before they can take the leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a surge of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence without remuneration in case of work leave (so far, they do not have a lack, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority are also returning to the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuse of unemployment.
"The controls are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of unemployment fraud.
In fact, this issue has been constantly monitored since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched which have normally paid off.
The French do not get sick more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us take a close look, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in unemployment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and work accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
That’s 2.5% of healthcare spending.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off due to illness.
Another study, in this case of the Insurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that the short-term absences were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered "duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting from a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of leave subsidies and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos declared to Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who made his first public speech at the opening of the vote of confidence debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted during the Eurozone Summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "it is at stake" the country's stay in the euro zone, he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to about 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He said he agreed with the goals of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but against any policies that prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert Committee Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Must Be Legalized
Canadians Live in Denial of Death, Royal Society of Canada Report Indicates
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For starters, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that did not agree with the position of the federal Government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with incompetent or non-consensual persons.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
In addition, 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that no proceedings should be instituted against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among their recommendations, they suggest that the Criminal Code should state that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his or her life without fear of facing a complaint.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for it to be considered euthanasia and to undergo the same procedures unless it serves to reduce physical pain.
Other experts have reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada experts.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the stance of the experts who signed the report "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar Assad intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union has stepped up sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have spoken out in favor of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that the mediation efforts Turkey has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the repression in Syria, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in the southern Syrian region of Deraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians have died “during bombings and gunfire in Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, considers for his part that the country "advances towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not falter", he added, guaranteeing that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which, in his opinion, is enclosed in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities held by the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League's decision was "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and start a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the designated President of the Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to request before Friday a vote of confidence from Parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he said, adding that he is "sure that markets will have patience and understand it."
Its appointment by the President initially gained market approval, but then worries prevailed, particularly following an unexpected fall in industrial output in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government is expected to run until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and aiming for Italy to "regain its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The "chief of the bosses" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not respect the deficit requirements".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "teacher" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put some 200 billion euros in state bonds before April 2012.
Russian Scientist Has Collaborated with Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. nuclear risk NGO said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concern" over a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear program of his country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared with an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that this type of crime and crime has increased again,” Human Rights First said, “the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” added Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he said, adding that such efforts could include improving police reporting of “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twitters", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or that follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they classify a message as a favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the consumer networks Facebook and Google+.
On the web, users have been debating the interest of this innovation with a bunch of "tweets" with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom writes.
Austro-Hungarian
Introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
The ruling Social Democratic/Christian coalition government in Austria on Tuesday decided to include a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure far above the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Christian Democrat Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit of 26 October to the member countries of the euro area: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
It's a strong full
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near-all-time highs following the Japanese intervention on Oct. 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that provoked the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing that the yen's rise in price will cut to the roots of a weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic powerhouse has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic bases".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “adequate measures”, implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury Notes by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds it dedicates to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the bags weaken
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock markets plunge a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new strains on loan yields in the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down 0.7%, renewing concerns from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and the exchanges will continue to be held within a reduced margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of worries about the future of the euro area is affecting the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is still at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, the option for a struggling country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds for the same period offered 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, continue to fuel the concerns of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a figure more favourable than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there’s one issue that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations in mind or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influences the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is fitting that an electoral meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue producing electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor in Switzerland, which is solely concerned with the construction of state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark must be considered.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition in principle to this type of energy, according to the surveys.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and which can create non-delocalizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the safety authorities, French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electrical actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them a clear path to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figures policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to including trivialities, indicating that the co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages, and employment that countries receive.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and undermines employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pressuring for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that immigrants are in reality more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly work in sectors where there is no employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the wages and employment of nationals.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows means a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked “with his teeth”.
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, all it needs to think about is a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but also fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to vote as directly as possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that it was a matter of thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and a control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence needs to be addressed in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a blank stop to the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to draw blows of effect, but a common, full-fledged, quiet and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that submits to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investments.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
Interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson still applies.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
The only way to achieve this is to build a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chip become generalized
The world chip card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations of the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminate, in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system,” announced Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable to carry out transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
The Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to commercialize an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless via their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected ties between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has the certainty.”
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,” he said, without elaborating.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Axis terrorists
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we certainly have to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and in the same style as those used by AQMI.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an illuminated community of little interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, “Western education is a sin”), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants launch into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are oriented in the first place to the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuja’s reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and abandons its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is disturbing for all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A crisis-weakened America, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strength.
They spread the often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for currency manipulation," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that means the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “sweeps away” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the soundings, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing “attempts to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen his piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges in a rather positive way the national security balance of Obama, who wiped out Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that lead to a collapse.
And, arguing that it takes economic rebuilding of America to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly with Russia via the Baltic Sea floor, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the banks of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km tee connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipe is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the land route by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large consumers of gas and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us,” Fillon said at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but the project managers renounced it as the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state-owned company to settle permanently at sea off its coast.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will stop the gas flow in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have predicted joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, entrained by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to that company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported," Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not surpass their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy pine-planted coastline.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore people’s taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch on the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century, to the current taste," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Away has been the confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at the beginning, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom in emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average.
“However, there is still a lot to be done.”
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "are the crux of the problem", says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that the surveyed directors have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities”, with an “excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled”.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“Now we have reached around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s grudge gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
“I want to move forward,” the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it's a set," he has been justified.
“I’m in Lille all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to stand."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the “pleasure”.
He has been cheering the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been his fan,” he says.
Certainly, this will reinforce especially the "special" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
“We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has for his part made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala game."
"Pride" also for verifying, as "neighbor", that France "returns to be a very high level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be attending the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal face with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubts; the Selecçao, which he has been running since September 2010, is going to qualify for Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the one-way match (0-0), Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home."
But at home, in the luminous Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the match "is very equal ", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match will be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012,” said Queiroz’s successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home," Bento said.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't give them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
