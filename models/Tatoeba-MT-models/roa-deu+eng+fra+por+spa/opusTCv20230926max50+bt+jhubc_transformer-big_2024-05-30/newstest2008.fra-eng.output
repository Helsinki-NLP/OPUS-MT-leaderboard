Inflation, in Europe, has slipped on the food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 countries of the euro area was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, said the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the policy interest rate by saying that decreasing interest rates, with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation in order not to have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market shares increased by 88 percent and soybean prices also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose 52 percent, and last month a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup Reports a Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December, so since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such low socialist support before, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against support of one-fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the loyal voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation of the country to be particularly serious has never been higher, it amounts to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook for last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only a tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than good.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, currently this rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the other 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent additional would probably participate. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the commercial triangle of Budaörs maintained the average price increase of 16 percent from last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already soared” in large grocery stores last December, have no longer risen sharply from the previous high base.
Nonetheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket amounted to 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices have remained close to last year's level, but turkey fillet, walnut and poppy prices have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread of one kilo was found at only 139 forint.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forint.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints per bottle of Coca-Cola.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we find a gap of 12 percent while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the VAT rate increase was already noted in last year's Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, as hypermarkets could not visibly determine how much margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumers.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the 2006 value, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest one also increased by 1,284 forints.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some staple foods, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to the daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the brutal price increase accepted also by multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues were formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies of not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured man from a serious car accident was released from the hospital but soon after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria that is in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National System of Hospital Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Center for Epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacteria that is well resistant to antibiotics that will proliferate quickly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, low-weight or weakened patients.
According to the director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, one does not find MRSA only there or not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, caregivers put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection can not always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not conducive to preventing the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should monitor inpatients and isolate patients with MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that these examinations are not funded by the National Social Security Fund.
Most cases only emerge if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, significant gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate through infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemics, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why this infection is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) places among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was the author of a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police station crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not going through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not an extenuating circumstance, according to the Highway Traffic Act, a car that starts a bend must let the pedestrians through.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and applied for retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is conducted by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
An additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million credit line agreements in Budapest on Friday to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The agreement on the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million appropriation also covers budgetary funding for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope first as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of the metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary had finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans not mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought on this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik also.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the shops and office spaces promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shore of the Black Sea and in the most reputable ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers fall into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 thousand, or old decayed houses, at a price ranging from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 thousand, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a capital gain in the medium or long term.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly increasing as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the moment, it does not want to discuss exact figures, while it is ready to sign an agreement on reducing, until 2020, greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit, apart from emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors likely under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to remain a flagship in the overall efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the successful signing of the ‘After 2012 Agreement’, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to take on appropriate commitments and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time made the commitment on 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the Nobel agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the new scientific body whose international report has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to the scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
The British army units are communicating, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of making themselves popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units intervening in Afghanistan upload video footage on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Soldiers of the air force have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" was watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered under the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original objective, the videos were put on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, defence consultant Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the validity of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos had already been streamed on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in real mission, but the British army is keen to upload these videos only recently.
The Americans do the recruiting a little differently by using the shooting game America's Army downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, yet another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it will not be the ministry employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for Christmas missionary, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department has a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be celebrating.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the roughly six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
During this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forint and was held Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million forint, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, the company that manages the tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
Costume is not compulsory
The ILO building hosted not only the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
The ball had 500 people.
The party began with the welcome words of the minister and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: Evening dress was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The ministries of health, labour and local communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forint.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and doughnuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forint.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall to which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Forces of the Mega Strike Gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams because the rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 13h.
The unions of the league will make known, on Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of workers' councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health insurance, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what action to take.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will only take place late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, significant traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop working indefinitely and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of them is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations report going on strike for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Union of Teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers called for strikes for 8 hours and 2 hours respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in turn, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, requires that the government withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is a guarantee for retirement before the legal age, which would allow the system to carry out the functions that it deserves before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians”.
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving themselves the name of "national self-defense association".
"The common feature of these rallies is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, in addition, evoking the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was happening according to the method which, based on the rancor of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status thus serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of such associations in court but also constitutes a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard’s constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that erupted in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to constitute a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defense”.
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some organizations of Bulgarian Roma regarding the establishment of their own guard as a way of resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude Hungarian Roma from responding to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, one can read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
Days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that New Year's Eve can rest peacefully.
In one year, we have eleven holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day and on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
Days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the replacement days of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all their employees employed, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service societies, institutions that are continuously running and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people rather do overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a day off on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can annoy colleagues terribly
Emails we forget to send, voicemails we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he has forgotten to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, this is done with an apology.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Do you remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you for stealing their property.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares their intimate secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Bury the shared information within yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you claiming to be sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearful headache because you feel bad or you feel you need to rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to notify your boss and your colleagues to avoid them being surprised that you will be absent the next day.
Fucking, giggling, phone
You're immersing yourself in your work, but the laughter of your colleagues pulls you out of it brutally?
Did you unwittingly become a witness to a conversation over the phone that you would have done better not to listen to?
Do not disturb your co-workers with humming, humming, aloud discussions (which you conduct over their heads), flickering, gross words, or discontent expressed aloud.
They can be disturbing even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send a letter or an important message, do not blame anyone for this forgetting!
Don’t blame it on the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconveniences to others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel at home at the office too much?
Putting on a jog and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to live up to your expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
We move slowly in the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with electronic effects associated.
I'm making the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of the whole hour, then a female choir joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and was playing himself in Yonderboi's group before he jumped on his own lane, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The line-up initially playing in small clubs began to be known by a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have undoubtedly become “trendy” but no one has asked them if they would like to wear this label.
The band reacted well, they released a new and better record.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are fine with the reference to flight but next to aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the louder guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's premiere at the Millennial Park.
On the album, we find a real radio tube, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere, too.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people in their 10s or 20s but also the older ones.
They follow the changes in light music much more closely because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts where the mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
I noticed that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you will no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, it was of course inevitable that our music was compared to that of Yonderboi because many of us left his band and took another path.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Petõfi’s list, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many have heard Zagar’s name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube so we could sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir with six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who were later called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song had been around for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from that song.
The sequence of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same melody that the girls learned later that night.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and also at the concert it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a solo role, they all sing together and they don't sing any louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scenes too.
Is that so?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is solely due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult tracks when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray’s Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock’n’Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn’t want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite thing about the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “let go” of this record.
They are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader has risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A concealed fraudster.
This is how its former employee refers to the French giant Societe Generale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
Now it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered in any way as incapable.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, and reported him to police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The Crisis Exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to having misrepresented the reports so as not to be screened.
He succeeded in deceiving his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his trades.
Whoever risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
I don't think so.
"I estimated that just getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He came to his post only gradually.
He started working at Societe Generale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was far less respected than the others.
In view of my university degree and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after taking office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
“As long as I was winning, they were pretending to close their eyes.”
This is when the start of the year hits.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it has lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his leave.
"Last year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes will go to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion kroner under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to $150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund which will manage next year an amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful recipients of EU funds among the new members.
Court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan president
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for the country's former president Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
However, he was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the hectic debate leading up to the vote on the government’s declaration of distrust, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies passed without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians interest the opinion much more than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not able to settle at the same time:
The first is the significant share given to the costs of mandates imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, stunned, bonds, over-indebted their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares in the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
They no longer have this source.
If we look only at the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, as has the rest of the world.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous disgrace that falls essentially on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which, in recent years, have unfortunately become unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if a delay in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system do not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only administer it.
Barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes regular expenses to be pushed back by mandate expenses.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not squandered as much money as they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to levy in taxes and taxation, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will progressively achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
The banks will have to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to customers.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting billions more losses.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they have to really understand what can still happen,” says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“I hear the situation is really bad,” he added.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
Central banks made this choice after they failed to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, even though the U.S., Canadian, and British central banks repeatedly lowered interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by the central banks will help avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the collapse of the US housing market.
President Klaus: the debates of the environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism has been directed at the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, it's a replacement for solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now, interested persons can read his positions without them being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, changes in it are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts made inefficiently to influence the climate are inefficient and costly.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unchecked opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driver's licenses whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are on the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are in a position to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of unlicensed drivers will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences especially those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has been increasing this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the issue within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of their driver's license by the end of the year and will be driving on the road without a valid driver's license will face a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay two thousand crowns maximum.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence using an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2,500 kroner.
According to former information, even a person who was not going to travel was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to exercise restraint and to impose fines not exceeding 1,000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
The driver's license is a document that people can use to decide whether they want to have it or not.
This is not like with the identity card, which must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driver’s license.
It is enough to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons holding documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to renew.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of the detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, former police officers accused of conniving with David Berdych’s gang, will face 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The High Court of Prague thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were liable to sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is still awaiting the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials in excess of 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people of involvement in robberies, the High Court was now handling the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants questioned the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, following an agreement, among other things, with Berdych, the members of the police transmitted information to the criminals from police sources, covered the various robberies and helped the gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution refers to the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited armaments.
During the house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang got tens of millions of kroner.
Aside from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already convicted Berdych and a whole host of others of other hand-held robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej who are currently living in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
Lawyer for the victims, Igor Veleba, is seeking compensation from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital for 12 million kroner plus costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál absolutely does not agree with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very very high," Dostál said after the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party commissioned.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” Dostál said.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family demanded one million kronor for each month when they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the university hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered psychological damage and were prone to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by the men, although they faced remorse for not having been able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, summed up the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
The governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il region handed out, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 kroner for reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally bound by civil liability insurance.
In case of non-compliance, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts had recognized relatively low compensation, the sums calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království (the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království (Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who had used for the first time the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team parasitize about the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial the lawyer of Polívka.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“Behind us is a work of almost ten years.
Money-seeking and event-focusing," he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project is successful and they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in her television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of making passports of the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království appear.
From a humorous action at the origin it emerged a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to have his name and signature mentioned in the passport and even offered to the holders of the sale on the price of visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the show mané<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
Collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetin.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>'s inspiration, assumed by singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, requesting that the court dismissed today.
What could bring the matter to light is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of the kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course sign up," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its bearing qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be qualified as inferior to the average.
However, there is currently on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, in turn, is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, I just have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I was complaining, for example, about headroom in the rear seats.
While there ends the complaints because the bodywork combi means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see what's done.
I will talk about the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days of complaining about too short seats or backrests are over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is sensitive there too.
The combi also sees disappear the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel glass) and rather easy to tie up.
The blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let’s stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to the competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to bring out the advantages, I would mention the underbody remaining after the backrests of the rear seats were inverted perfectly straight, or a very low footstool.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with an Otto four-cylinder engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's what a 1.6 that runs a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust plugged by a wiper, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 liter engine amounting to 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still reasonable.
The vehicle we have tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition, we have head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> at the end of the day.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the remaining children about the development of local education.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflicts between Slovak residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicanes and quarrels between students have been transposed into the relationship between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that police in Chatham have arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly addressed racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“As we were coming home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining ones went so far as to call conflicts with immigrants a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
Seventy thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
There is only one island on which you will find much more and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the heads of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Habana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already for a long time, in such a salty and humid climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the surroundings are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane was re-entered from the plantations extended into the sweets on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives can be seen in motion whose contemporaries are not elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Not to mention that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile earth that has been taken into their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can experience the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought it glory and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the beauty and the city-vitrine character of this small city.
Koloniální <0xC5><0xA1>pan<0xC4><0x9B>lská architektura,v<0xC3><0xBD>razn<0xC4><0x9B> ovlivn<0xC4><0x9B>ná pozd<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC5><0xA1>ími francouzsk<0xC3><0xBD>mi osadníky, <0xC4><0x8D>ty<0xC5><0x99>i staletí tém<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> nezm<0xC4><0x9B>nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
Nothing was built, and that is why nothing was demolished either, everyone was content to have a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is also worth going to see interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes to life after sunset and where the music deafens only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without traces of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Rock of Cuba, thanks to its unspoilt landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (actually, it was born about a hundred years after the voyage of Columbus) and from the hill where stands the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, Sow Bay and Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuba's patron saint Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the ancient slaves, about all this one could fill up a number of pages.
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, US says
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, influences the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
Alongside the growing protest from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the U.S. this week called through Defense Minister Robert Gates for NATO troops to step up activity, Britain prioritizes strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent from last year, to 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the south.
Now, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts among the countries involved over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
“Uncovered lazy Afghans: Germans play, while ours fight,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
Thanks to better-than-expected state budget savings, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt as of the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion kroner.
“For now, it appears that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border by a trillion kroner in 2009 alone.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor’s forecast is similar: “One could surpass the trillion in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it turns out that the political situation is changing, that policies are willing to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I’m not expecting this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated essentially by the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, annuity bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's external debt has so far increased this year from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt owed by the State was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased year-on-year from the first to the third half by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a far too high figure.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be room to negotiate when pension reform comes," Pikora said.
Better than expected
It follows from the government's debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution in the savings of the state budget, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The sum consists essentially of the deficit of the state budget which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroner initially planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government annuity bonds for 43 billion kroner and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
She was in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students from 6 to 7 years old give the name of Mohammed to a teddy bear while any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with a lash.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with assault on Islam and sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself had no label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", according to him it was only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very caring towards her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Is it possible to give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honor their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence in the immediate future but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist that negotiations continue beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botshan-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the hotel in Baden where these "negotiations of the last chance" were taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
In particular, Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
“Kosovo’s parliament will have the last word”
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people would be made "in consultation" with the West.
Bush snatches deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference he held Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a definitive settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty solving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and focus on all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the deadline for the end of 2008 for the implementation of his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of various facts, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car circulated Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyro light," a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to drive on public roads” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating “at a very high speed”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” a police officer said.
Alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crash, starry windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the violence of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, coordinated with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation by the IGPN, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foot brackets on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the place very quickly, thus not providing assistance to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which we have to be very careful about," a police source said.
Libération met with an eyewitness in the few moments following the accident.
One of its windows overlooking the stage.
"We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court barristers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The movement of lawyers on Monday garnered the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "urged the population to send flowers to judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency and rubbish to those who have sworn in before Musharraf".
Musharraf's promise no longer holds.
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exceptional measure proclaimed Saturday night.
It was to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect vote of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "does not hold up anymore" after the state of emergency was imposed, deputy information minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The deputy minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was put under house arrest by his deputy chief of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed a better "mastery of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated to the nearest month for a couple in five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of work in space to make the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky outing that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools “do-it-yourself” by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts unloaded the Discovery module Harmony, a large cylindrical piece that will soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for modules-laboratories.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5-tonne solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged for nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was halted so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit of the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46, this doctor of training was therefore in charge of “operating” the “injured” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of “slats” on the damaged area.
He was aided by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey rod wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and crafted by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
EADS shares are currently down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aerospace and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% at 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast due to delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the list of united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president showed nothing by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without any stumbling blocks,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, that is far from the point.
It is a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that “there have never been such dirty elections, even in the days of Yeltsin.”
After last weekend's crackdown on protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus”
Behind these unsuspensive legislatures are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
No successor has emerged.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, in both the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovietus, they do not feel master of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of St. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society has lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous communal spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willingly renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly shown after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only searchable for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his assignees.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States having been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research "including on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of this archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the opening of these nominative documents to the public, owing to the sensitivity of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s 9th trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A free trade pact would greatly affect both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, again reaching Man's eighth meeting of the European Commission.

Bank of England takes note of worries by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10bn over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned to ease the current return of worries about credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve inflow during the maintenance period beginning on December 6th in the form of a five-week open-market transaction," the bank said in a statement.
The bank said 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) would be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time that the BoE has placed five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are usually done at a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to keep rates" of interbank loans day-to-day in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the money marketed by the Bank of England was accompanied by a high penalty rate that had discouraged banks from using it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC Refuse to Consider PS Purchasing Power Proposals
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the supervision of rents.
As the UMP and NC voted against examining the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of MPs PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who has, no more and no less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to be held Aug. 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational duties of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” he’s ever seen, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working together to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We chose Philadelphia as our market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” Jones said.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, having stood out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours takes place rather in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a European country festival and an American urban one."
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very large", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations were issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed yet at the time of going to press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract the Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governor”?
“We have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge to be the best,” he said.
The Race to Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be up to all festivals on the West Side, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, showcase them and ensure that filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil premieres in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock market generally has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions based exclusively on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are lurking in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in long and short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely lowering of the Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative outlook.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked depending on the information that comes from the European Union with regard to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, said the increase would be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they do.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that tech companies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to computer on its year-end rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experiment of the Banque Populaire will be decisive for whether or not other organizations adhere to this initiative that coincides with the hours of the shops.
This is precisely what the People's Bank seeks.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about the opening of new branches but a renovation of the existing ones.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank’s commercial manager, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of personnel, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banco Popular has already tested its initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've made it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he directs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: "What hurts me is not that we have increased more but that we have decreased less," he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a growth of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) reached 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which ceded 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a decline of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communication companies was 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price point and how we monetize it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this to be true, the television channel is expected to see a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year from $965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenna 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million), while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company decreased Antenna 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves transposition of Mifid, which came into force on November 1
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts of Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree to the best possible regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies so that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of the financial markets, at a time when it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial consulting services to be provided to both specialised societal purposes and to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting firms (FCAs), which merge with securities firms, securities agencies and portfolio managers.
In addition, it is increasing the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that securitized debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of American high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took the opportunity to legally delineate the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after that in 1977, was approved, the royal decree that delineates the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised consumer price index rises by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed next December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good", Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in relation to the figure announced today.
Virgin plans to recover <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it was raising some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization to its financial trade brand Virgin Money, needs to seize about a quarter of the UK banks’ revenues that will be deposited over the next three years to secure the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18,000 million until it reaches the <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 million target.
Tycoon Richard Branson, known for his campaigns in the UK, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the association of Virgin, in which participate three other companies, including his favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the municipality of Totana (of the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May Juan Morales, current deputy of the right, and until then municipal councilor of the city, and according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Planning Council and the possibility of new stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the 'people's party' deputy Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
The secretary of the organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of that party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group that will chair the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, which on November 15 made public its decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon its political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the academic setting.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political forefront since he abandoned it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even though citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend that he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he remarked, into what his opponents might consider "domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjects to merciless persecution both skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government contributed in a decisive way to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced on us, what economic consequences will this have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and pay to save the planet.
But there was and will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to a hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish socialist party seemed to him so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a matter of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that it is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not claim that we travel by bicycle or cool off with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation informed today.
The City Councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the City Hall, where at this time many officers met, who also presented themselves to the City Councillor's Office of Urban Planning and to the Municipal Industrial Land and Housing Management Company.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Court No. 1 of Totana is investigating.
The first six detainees have now been placed at the disposal of the courts.
According to the sources, Totana's former municipal councillor and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councilor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crime Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Therefore, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, who may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana in Murcia, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that have been requalified and its project would suppose to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of offences on downloads from the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, the theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store with a value of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty imposed for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research titled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depends on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using magnetic resonance tomography scans at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition imaging at the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for the past eight years from the prosecutor's office at the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died –, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, ' la liste de Carla ' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes the fleeing criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Auto insurance, which covers the driver in the event of a loss, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driver's license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the right car.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the odds to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have lower claims rates due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of having an accident.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will present the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various drawbacks when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as poor driving experience and seniority of the driver's license.
Although the ideal way to be well-insured is full-risk insurance, there are other, more economical options.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for an all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they get the coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be," specifies Luis Noguera, the manager in Spain of First Europa, online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
I'll give you some advice.
If you are under 25, try to be cautious and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will have an impact on the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and the company's profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses ", clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into an insurance contract, as the loss rate is reduced thanks to the experience accumulated.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose an all-risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally young people can not take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates full-risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claims rate, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have more casual driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” Noguera said.
For retirees an all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (being this of 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible losses, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow play each other in San Siro on Tuesday in search of what they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth matchday ends, as AC Milan are due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the last eight.
A loss by Gordon Strachan could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but they will not be able to computer only on that as with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth-finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the overtime (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only come to Shakhtar, in the event that Celtic lose, to qualify for the eighth of the final to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the group that made fury in the late 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that picks up their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd filling GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days before.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', who left the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and who caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I’m glad I made a decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have gotten better and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibiting on December 23rd.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine sounds the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported through pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company supplying the gas, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned since it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, reminding that we are a country through which most gas transits," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of supplies of Gazprom destined for Ukraine.
This resulted in falling exports to Western Europe, consequently raising prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The health ministry “must control its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the checks to be carried out on its extra-community employees to check if they have criminal precedents, the control committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the June Glasgow airport attack.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas employees it employs.
His report nonetheless highlighted other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General did checks on extra-community personnel following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of involvement in various car blast attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the Auditor General now states that committees are required to confront the Criminal Records Review Office, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
"Although we have found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health performs most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings will bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of problems with the identification of permanent contract staff who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for overseas health service personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and commit to ensuring better execution of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which are valid for all employees, including people from overseas.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic about Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, won five awards, including best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in the film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller “Notes on a Scandal.”
Daniel Craig, the Bond star won the Variety Award for having allowed the British film to be in the international spotlight.
The awards were handed out during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control chronicles Curtis's rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best debut director.
Rock also won the Best Documentary award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character portrayals, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terror plots
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells plotting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed al Qaeda attack in 2006 on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of the arrested people belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudis headed into Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim government allied to the United States, considered heretical according to the hardline Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the government’s ruling royal family policy.
The activists, encouraged by the calls made against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama bin Laden, the leader of Saudi-born Al Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five ... months," the interior minister's spokesman said on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thinking”, the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the orbiting European spacecraft showed that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had Earth-like conditions, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation allied to a slower rotation has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic changes in the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovakian and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to it as a presidential candidate, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as those from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected a lot of the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate in the next elections.
It is unclear on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong points for the Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to call when they hear funny things: The board found approval increases when candidates spoke rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is at the head of the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegal immigrants regular status and the opportunity to become a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to delve into this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns about toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the gun control campaign.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We didn’t expect Mike Huckabee, who led Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism, to declare that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When they insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant search by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles in Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged from the void, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés cannot agree on who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly with a message of success about American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra-conjugal toe sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have concealed for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have fought well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister stepped back in his election project, stupidly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls had not influenced his decision, and that he hoped instead, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the brink of crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities revealed an incredible red tape.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being defense minister is a part-time job for them.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations on the part of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary general of the Labour Party (and his former head of vigilance) have caused that they have had to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and they don’t trust them, but they usually leave their doubts on the side when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: public administration no longer works; cabinets of ministers take stock; the press looks for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any purpose anymore.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he wished to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long-running investigation into the party’s “cash money for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the plight of Mr. Brown is not as tragic as it seems.
The blunders are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party would have you believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no casualties or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to materialize Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies of all time, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his own opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians’ big subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who spoke about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even if most of the payments made were made following his arrival to government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown needs to do, such as find a permanent chair for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financially of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a partisan as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good lead in elections; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate flawless integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the shares of the balance sheet that are or are unrecoverable more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of weak cardholders.
It is too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States concerning personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses to credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the capital security of credit cards is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the 2007 emission volume will be 25 percent higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair housing loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow rather than wealth value, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily resulted in a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring advantages to the issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority for repayment.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgage holders and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of having a rapid recovery of stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the borrowings,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster of the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of having a consequent decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly face a gruesome future.
Be careful of the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify their roles in a fraud committed by Enron’s previous chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s PLC group, became famous across Britain because of the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains a pending question for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
Accusations against the bankers, nicknamed the “Natwest Three,” claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to set up a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rigged bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had assessed its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three Britons already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest from the branch bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth those $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have gotten $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron Debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national corporation, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in loss of market value and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither money, nor outside of Moscow.
The cost of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, powered by a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats since it’s more of a family-use plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer-incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer scrutinized a shiny orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans got so rich and came to Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians emerged as the largest spenders in the world.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of London jeweller Davis Morris.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who grasped her haute couture dress as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to queue in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum candies, Mövenpick ice cream, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears are on display.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Delf Dutch porcelain manufacturing factory stand, in front of a handmade blue tile Raimbrant wall painting.
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling”
Indeed, the sellers here have stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the fair.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, walk the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, King Koil beds CEO Roman Ershow said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold thread.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $ 170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," Karapetian said.
He’s definitely going to keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled in bulk with counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passengers arrested to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unauthorized Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston was looking through the bay window of Just a Little Healthier and watching an ambulance stop at the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized that someone had died.
Authorities would later learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confident that the results of toxicology tests, which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and found Mlle arroyo on the couch.
She was declared deceased.
A little over a week has passed since, and authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mlle Castro's home where a faded rose bush rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the buzz of the global stock market.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the soothing remarks of the U.S. central bank vice president.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, declared that those who decide, must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
Should this turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further tightening financial conditions for homeowners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further declines in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil have been accentuated following the declaration of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 Index gained 165.5 points or 2.7%, closing at 6306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a monthly tri-fund auction by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London financial markets causing credit tensions, have caused the monthly three-day “Libor” borrowing rates of British banks, have caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England faces a call to judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the coaching chairman who was exceptionally there to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make their decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the CEO of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
The one who fails to win the number 6 bib will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes out of lack of luck more than out of lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to bring Bopara to the fore?
Is that fair in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"; both, new executives with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless at least one chance is given?
The numbers have their importance in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison was in great shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class gates over 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett has only taken 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer more.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium is just a matter of opinion.
This choice could annihilate or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and succeeded in the first one, with five doors and 40 laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double cent against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable innings start at the 88 Test in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made only ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his hometown of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by coaches when Vaughan was once again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his impetus so evident in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of life.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently threw himself into a 4x4 at a presentation of England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if “‘had he seen this?’”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his fast pace allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this the true art of selection?
I would be good to give Bopara a chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normality.
Some have returned to fight against the activists who have driven them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to walk away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-backed militia had allowed him to drive Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the growing calm of the capital since US troops arrived, and to the view of continuing training of well-armed “involved citizen groups” working with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decline of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the visas for exiles that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecation, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Economics Institute in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high quota of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saar also leads the children of the country to higher schools in higher than average numbers - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In the Saarland, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, a training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
Due to the number of inhabitants, the double curricula panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
This is why the Sarrois Ministry of Education has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in the subjects of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a lot of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced throughout the federated state comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursery is exempt from the law - a pattern that in the meantime other states copy as well.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether student performance is improving sustainably.
In the 2003 PISA studies, the number of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite the Sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chavez sets the clock
In Venezuela, watches will soon tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the clock by half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez is becoming a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, as a result of a new law, watches will be set at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t, just because of my dignity,” Chavez said, hurrying for a constitutional reform that the country’s citizens will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger of this dispute was Uribe’s decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spit in Venezuela's face" with this decision, Chávez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is making fury in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angered by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to be silent.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite strong economic conditions, according to a forecast, a real decrease in wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the low wage development, the increase in the value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild.
New charges could also arise in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was learned that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the rate of inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and windstorms at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been assuming that there are flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today provided the proof - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning bolts on Venus erupt at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have brought life to Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be very few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the infernal twin of Earth, but she remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which resembles Earth so much in mass and dimensions, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venus research, as no probe was on its way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the researchers' opinion, the most recent research findings that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than initially assumed.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the already known whirlwinds of wind at the north pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
Of both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the dispute between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and summons the grand coalition to end the quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the welcome of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained about the CDU's "frontline policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel admit that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shootings, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets with violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Burning barricades, breakers shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also form in our homes and is defused in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems either from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian towns, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings were burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government, that is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat stresses that the share of unemployed young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be above average.
First and foremost, more places for training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many immigrant youth also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we must still be cautious."
It should "swiftly give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few cars and garbage cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles were overwhelming in Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry into the scene shows that the coalition is done with the substance – and that there is nothing left to expect from her.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After her desolate intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this rebuke was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees into foreign policy and even there stays in the closet.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, she welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate targets will have to be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she's clinging to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
In doing so, it destroys its image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases for that.
In this respect, the number of times that she makes lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
It wavers in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates bursts already on the first subject.
It would have made New York a “shelter for illegal immigrants,” Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani said, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of using undocumented immigrants.
As the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have uploaded via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney too is vigorously taught by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which one simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go in the meantime beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are rejected, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are revealed once again.
"I made a mistake at the time," Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, runs into a sinking knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns as a civilian for the first time.
A day after his retirement as head of the armies, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus ends eight years of military rule.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as commander of the armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency was instituted with lawyers from his ranks, dismissed last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on Oct. 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the Afghan border.
The fathers of the Krautrock are returning.
The German supergroups of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
On their return, recordings of their great success "Live 1974" were released.
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed throughout the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among others even a Beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
It doesn’t seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia plays again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasoned in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always been more pleasing in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne band Can for their work, the audience saw German pop faces interrogating.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the power of impact that was felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubleshooted in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, on a former Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
Supposedly there was in the garbage can a flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood alone was not for self-seeking purposes.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone believes to remember.
Rother expressed at this time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set out to maintain the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of the Krautrock would be circumscribed with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amidst the singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
The projections of other black and white photos of bazaar wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front of them, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by gluing microphones to the organ and drums, to shoot instruments with unprecedented sounds thanks to self-built effects instruments.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three of them are great technical technologists.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is now no longer irritated by it now.
But what is most self-evident will be thoroughly covered on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
It can hit the nerves of someone (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace", two films again deal with the Balkan war.
But both do not convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because far too many kind and futile roles in women’s sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as locomotive drivers' collective agreements?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of winks: deep down, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to its decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderful Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel to failed films about the Balkan war.
The film tells the story of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two still falls in love quickly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost far too quickly in the action and the exchanges of senseless shots.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why deep down there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in small teams into the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge on the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that one should refer the crime against film logic to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) of not conducting the hunt intensively enough due to secret political agreements.
But the good intentioned and the bad are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
One speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be mean."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumbling heads, but which hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
One can add: there have never been good films about South Africa.
Which is true every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis hotbed or a minefield, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Jenseits go Grenzen” with Angelina Jolie or “Blutdiamanten” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, it’s still decades before Hollywood can make a good holocaust movie with Schindler’s List.
Some films have yet to mature - those that are worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were in no way unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today just too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatombe happens live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" have actually become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan Wars, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in horrific ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust picks up the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunity.
The principal director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described the abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivational force in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not definitively belong to the past, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, by burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg’s bid for the 2015 Universiades as “not being a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Sports Higher Schools had initially in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD faction criticized the Senate for not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, for its part, would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, broke against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden crate, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" circulated a few months ago in doubt the authenticity of Andy Warhol's "Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968", the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten - one of the hundreds of Briy's great gifts on the market in 1995.
Ancient history is entangled, a bewildering chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden cases, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden crates produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time are now talking about about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original licensed Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes, with the name "Stockholm Type".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum falsely claimed later that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later have ceded to him.
In truth, the 105 cases of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The texture of the copies dating from the year 1990 reveals on the contrary that the paint was directly applied without a layer of background on the laminate panels, using a roll of paint - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," suggests Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection.
Already in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cases.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers gave up, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not be held accountable for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel shortly before using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched for hours in the building.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to watch over them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops loyal to the government closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chair convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' action.
“People have had enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
Gen. Danilo Lim, who pre-commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila had already been the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke down almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyout.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
With this step we are trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is said in the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillich.
As part of a capital increase, Drillich has listed 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.1 million.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, particularly to increase the shareholding in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The hardly predictable poker on Freenet that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillich held a direct interest in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
