The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it fell about 6%.
The downturn this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is expressed the market reaction to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the plan of stabilization of the secretary of the financial sector.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stocks saw a dramatic fall on Tuesday, though the index eventually softened some of the losses throughout the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index during its financial day was nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock market, according to the Index’s secretary, fell 3.6 percent.
"The planned rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial markets around the world," said Hong Kong Currency Office Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroner) should be devoted.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent, a similar fall in volume last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a comprehensive pact of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a breach in talks on approving the bailout in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and vote on it.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and Assembly Banking, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Later, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a big step forward.
We resolved our differing views regarding the way the market stabilization package should be," Democrat Nancy Pelosia told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives from lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial firms to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already on it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has an express impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Democratic Sen. for Nevada Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively pass a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ business in the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved, which consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
“We worked everything.
The House of Representatives should be ready to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s progress and that he values “the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the taxpayer tax protection program money for its losses, a relieving closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of companies participating in the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This should be handled by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a big step toward the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who are having trouble with their payments.
The government would have to agree on new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to lower the monthly charges on debtors’ installment payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
“And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more importantly, as early as this week, the congressmen will agree on their support and give them their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that such approval will be reached is, at this time, the most important thing," Marek said.
Armed fighting: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It is better to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the demands of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern turntable to listen on it the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crowded on their shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of turntable.
This is the same with music that is on the way, i.e. compressed, simplified music - MP3 music.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobiles.
No other device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as phone, send messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even get to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs they will have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile, the sooner the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy tragons.
Few mobile phones are able to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top, constantly call still get, for more security, a charger for work - this applies also to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst ones can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly to the memory card but only in some reader units without reduction can be connected the small memory cards that are used in mobiles.
In players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library based on the performer's name, album title, genre or also based on user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music in the background and are going to listen to it every day just for a while, like on the tram, then any mobile phone you play is enough.
This is what virtually every mobile really does.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album via the mobile internet.
This service could by itself be a powerful argument for purchasing a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the themes of fleeting radio success.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use a built-in player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account by downloading data.
Which Apparatus to Decide
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, use the most specialized mobile-walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the line walkman have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand cited above brings MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long before he gets here.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS that send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, has already stated that there is no longer room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in prices to which the classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages which however, is often counteracted with the offer of more tight services.
So, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a good hit also betting on a nothing trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically aimed at man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and can be trusted,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works for this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if such a concept as that of Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the service offer is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told mobil.cz by phone.
He indirectly said that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to move forward in the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times are flashing.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has approached us with any complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators are concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to be developed."
He adds: “In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that it would be possible to study in such a short horizon.
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it to be the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a drop in prices and with it, a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when it emerged U:fon.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested by publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, it is not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile market was opened to a fourth operator.
As far as the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is only natural that the entry of another player into the market would be very demanding for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance on this issue.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was closed.
To date no agreement has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders was rather not interesting enough for the classical operators," added Kristián Chalupa, of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS Foreign Relations department, to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, apart from that they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators operate normally, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the lower prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and the lowering of prices are not in the interest of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really the dramatic shock in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether this is really a coincidence offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position and therefore do not have a corresponding increase in liability in their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunication regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of conflict.
There is obviously a relevant market analysis by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge, the agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they clash with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the telecommunications field from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands on this whole matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s competition in the field of commercial tenders was not put into effect recently, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this perfectly, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
All is well when no one is looking.
At the same time, a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists in Czech cellular networks is still functioning unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions at all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as the ones you cite were discovered, we could talk about a breach in the terms of the contract that could translate into the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová responded to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they obtain a not negligible profit and, at the same time - unlike the authentic virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so much percent of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name so they cannot have it absolutely as a normal customer of the operators.
Precisely this is what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> minimally strange.
In addition, a new question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS appears.
If mobile operators turn their eyes on this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has enough competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive?
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at the moment and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether formal measures or informal pressure resulted in the emergence of the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge others.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body spends this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases suits them.
But let us not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If one of the operators allows a virtual mobile operator to enter, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one to male voice and one to female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
The singers are Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The composers of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful anthems.
Czech Radio has previously said that it intentionally chose solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried with the two and then with the Choir, too, to look at the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had a consonance," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the boards of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company.
It can now be purchased by nearly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the transport company’s info centers and stations at the Metro, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Koby Raylis<0xC4><0x88>any,
The bonds can be bought from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce, can definitely start to forget about the ticket stands at the metro stations, where until now they had to queue regularly to get a regular ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with trained personnel that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said the spokesman of the project, Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the e-voucher on the Opencard at the vending machines that are in some of the subway lobbies.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker and travelers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
Using the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, in the bypass trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the inhabitants of the localities of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher," explained the ticket control, Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for this on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver checks the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel on ring road buses and do not remember when the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudetenland demanded in 1945 that Smoke be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans were addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land <0xC5><0xA0>umava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with a "people bearing the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts."
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the German southeasters presumably presupposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we will be handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way contributes to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of reprisals from the “Czech oppressors”.
If the US president presumably doubted this idea of the Germans <0xC5><0xA1>umavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA1>umavas lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the US or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists it accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had little intuition that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was imprisoned by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way one could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that before getting started they fasten their belts.
It wants to reach the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, also professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that bump into emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
Don't think - pay!
The word "don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "paid."
This should symbolize that man in a moment of despair can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will “scare” viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"The sugar and whip system is good for drivers.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why an information campaign in the press is necessary and mainly negative advertising, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel’s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, pronounced on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’ll keep a bit of this land, but to the Palestinians we’ll have to give up a similar percentage (of Israel’s land) because without this there will be no peace,” he said.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, sacred and historical place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to let go of to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Cheetah movement), they will have to detach themselves from the permanent support that Hamas (the Cheetah movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq provoke.
Questions after the accident: Are stewardesses on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can not walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether the flight attendants and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the road traffic law," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the unsafe place of the vehicle despite having two other seats reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the precise moment when the steward distributes the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no places to go on foot, the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Eventually this was removed and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,” the statement said.
The stewardess does not know the law
“There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, less tacitly, the spokesperson Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot sites.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are sites for standing and limited maximum speed, intercity with sites for standing with a higher speed permit, and those for long distances without sites for standing, with the highest speed permit, and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s Transport Safety expert, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, sees no major problems with the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Even here you are not sure that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess can be hit on the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes it is evident that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier", he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the flight attendant service.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess post is risky, then I will suppress it.
The coffee and the newspapers can receive it, the passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’re against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line linking Naples a young flight attendant from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the blinkers.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he collided with the front right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the stewardess's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year thirty experts are working members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They don’t focus too much on buses, but rather on the points system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile during the ride,” says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses to be an important threat to the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, adding that the police and the Office of Occupational Safety were responsible for controlling the safety of buses.
The hope of Dusseldorf is supported in Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of the West LB bank to its employees does not lack great words.
By merging the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA can be formed <0x60>a central market of capitals of the financial group of Sparkassen', as it says the writing, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘block of competition’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a beginning for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to be understood, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in difficult times.
Because just like before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance, which has recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, on the Frankfurt side too, there has been a lot of talk about such a merger between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know from their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, made it known that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board of directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen appears the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the bank DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank began dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, expressed that he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
For when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are to pass, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than Stuttgart and Munich real estate did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can reconcile the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and so everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre barrel of Kaiser branded beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds it knows how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses leave, <0x60>direction Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mostly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
To Marco, who wears a long coat with a lining of artificial leather and glasses with silver-colored pins, these buses belong.
For the past five years they have been coming to the Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates make another break on highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others get together, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent of the campaign open, that means to go!” cries Marco in the dawn.
"Go!" Go and take the back seats in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the front seats, because we're going to block, and all of you with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!"
A liter of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon, exactly at 10:30, you have to get here!"
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties yellow caps on trees, road signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
We want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The police of Munich receive help from seven policemen of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, ahead of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Good thing, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking environment will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a credit of a billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist the turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters that the loan aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the equity share lagged slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment revenues and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, debtor imputation revenues and some securities as well as those from the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from the repayments of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could charge a deficit with about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financer was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
Since much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and as well as state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had been cancelled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial provider in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans declined essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for the financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially not fit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for the Surveillance of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It’s even conceivable that you don’t need funding in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
It was rumored that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so the temporary salvation can not reassure at least worried people.
The stock price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing rates based on position in the property registry clearly tend downwards.
Affected are above all the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were once an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start with the amortization of pensions on time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the sleepless nights, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to and use the transport to new account of losses for future benefits compensation tax payments on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop had to show up at Tachibana Highschool on the first day, the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
Alone I had to find my way, luckily I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as at my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
Also, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the audience, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I went to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because two years ago I had begun to study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and nodded and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong rang, I felt really assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recess everyone took out their blessings.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German pieces of bread.
It had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of being able to know him better during a recess.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I am very curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he would always answer:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
I have been reading manga for years now.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger runs away, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control if they, behaving in a way similar to us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we engage in other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it becomes dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, as some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness with the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and the executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be missing absolutely in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, in many cases would differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed by our experiences, so your research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific investigations.
One could investigate the processes of consciousness of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential goes more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what does that mean for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system is activated a part of the brain that is responsible for that, the same thing happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very attached to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to describe the states of others as well as ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the brainstem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving in such a way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, because it is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the resemblance of behavior does not yet prove the resemblance of experience.
That’s true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches, on the other hand, don’t have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, here we expect progress in the field of neurology as long as we measure the same for rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I would rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a confidence test of Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that's not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to do in both countries.”
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's outrageous counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life – and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counter-attacks.
The backward war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with InStyle magazine Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the extent of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of how often Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old man told the New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "regrettable" that Jack, her 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and changes, all of which means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently fathered twins.
And so he ends with his remarks highlighting: "However my life goes on.
I’m happy because I have a wonderful family that’s fine.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008 air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays were again made cheap - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial services provider of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of “American tourists’ interests in traveling diminished.”
The decline in hotel prices is also far more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial hotspots such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airfare prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airfare prices in Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the sluggish growth of the economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is declining.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia does not go out to score the 11th goal yet.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he meant exactly by reacting to what happened could be read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the booth entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist at the HSV, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers as a nod.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
"Not everything was nice to see today," Marcell Jansen added later.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head-shot; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
This Monday, the Hamburg SV will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to play it,” Marcell Jansen said.
It foresees that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the veleity of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their players forced late like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalscorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of voting
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the banks’ bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in his history.
The Dow Jones recovered a bit.
About 20:30 one of the most important stock market barometers in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, fell more than seven percent to 1548 points.
At the moment the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs were down nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a big investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The bailout plan foresees making available resources to buy so-called “rotten” mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid in one go but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial partnerships that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cash.
Stock prices in Europe and U.S. continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state-projected financial market salvation, the U.S. Dow Jones continues to fall.
The losses of speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite the bailout actions of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s stock one time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Financial markets around the world have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York City began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation bill, the Senate vote may be on October 1.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's main Nikkei after-profit index fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.33 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase the shares of Arcandor lost in the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim underwrote 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity may not be so correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are now freezing he threatens a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun probe Ulysses.
But what surprised researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
All of a sudden the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what was left of astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Universe researchers have only known about the existence of Dark Matter for ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
As confirmed by Italy’s foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions from the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE talks about the most important cases.
Apparently the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"Now we control his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and in safety, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be delivered to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather Abuse 'Leads to Suicide'
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Truro Royal Court, through an inquiry study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confession paper, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and bandage her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some of Ms Rande's friends had said about her, that having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "renunciated life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession concluding, "I used to tie her up and wind her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it’s that if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended up in court.”
“I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother the abuse was on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a business trip through the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to police.
It is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Juridical Service noted that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley bank ransom/rescue.
The government, in effect, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it "humiliating" that the societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accrued in the interim is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial firms that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr. Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutual construction societies organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The residents of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Bangladesh Prime Minister denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was given probation to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
“The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina arguing that he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad on parole,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We're going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her supporters argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to his homeland after October 17, an Awami League leader said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are accused of.
Fears for polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have failed to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hampered thousands of officials while conducting vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that forced the company to reduce its stake in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals for Competition that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV below 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB’s interests hampered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV’s independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the requirement to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of US lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produrador General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others their colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic of much honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said it would be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and came to number 15 on the chart.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell remained about nine years in the charts and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, roughly 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has fans.
For example, there’s Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to revamp Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Vengeance Community Committee for Land Use meeting this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, <0x23>3 community district manager, said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, while waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee for Preservation, confirmed that it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than managing it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the East Village’s burgeoning, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, no matter how modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with week-old newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidate positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-speaking students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the gap in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively rated in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than that favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main Sixth Street, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in dealing with the contents of instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We've had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who came from Mexico and that, if you walk into the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of your party on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for bilingual education obscures the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than despising or trivializing them.
Oil price drops sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before receding, once again, due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached a deal over the weekend on the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The developments in the latest episode of the merger process confirm that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, on the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal "appear to have failed to reactivate market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates is going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the projected reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
Having spent, for the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing on defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw how things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned an unmarked game into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing in the barrage, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets ever made in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini, asked to describe the madness of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
They’ve won a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Rested Gebrselassie leads his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proven why many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the accommodating flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has shattered by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in hindsight - that air pollution would aggravate her asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have converted to long distances, the marathon record has been lowered by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left it fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of orchestrating their careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the grandeur of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, started challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers declined.
But shortly before three miles to the finish, Gebrselassie took one last push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best personal record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a clever calculation run, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make headway and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and trials of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of Greater Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, Harlem’s most famous Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Depression Season – remains a place apart.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what is being lost."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to begin a dialogue on the issue of race, many are still cautious in front of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of black affirmation and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes scorned, others praised - that was born from slavery in America.
Not surprisingly, those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her in-depth dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten inward the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a face of cement in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Outside the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized citing men singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, recalls that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turnaround came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane highway in the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a bunch of white boys were going around town throwing oranges and everything at the people sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the Supreme Court's forced integration that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents today say the school desegregation, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — they were used to hugging the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't embracing your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just like she did, with buoyant confidence and lines like: “How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous grave of Mrs. Hurston and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed highway.
“The resurrected idea of the five-lane road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street from the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville's history, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
An advance permit is needed to do most of the interviews, and some things — like the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field — can’t be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he may need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare go this far, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at their history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and gigantic TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City face daily the worst “bad office day” since the downturn of 1929.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts across the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men keep dragging between freighty apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning takeaway, and it’s still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on business days.
Employees still queue for their bagels to the vendors’ carts, and yet it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, still, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from which they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from the credit unions and from the savings banks of their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and which they say treat clients as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become experts in finance in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its grieving-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was commenting on the matter familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, the fifty-something janitor in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the Austrian far-right freedom party, and Filip Dewinter of Belgium, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing the mosques with a red line crossing them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun Cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some of the tombs, but researchers think this may have happened in an attempt to conceal the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right-wing turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria’s Future, had led a campaign centered on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were deemed xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and expressed opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25 at Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, under being under the register of sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and you also need to inform the police of the planned date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: “Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: “Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 to 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master offstage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to get the relaxed look of the man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they will not go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the program of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, when seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character within.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the flavor of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1977 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in their life, be it a long instant or a short one.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or confront people, characters, that sometimes you do not even know, or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, located at 20 Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and talks about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his visit to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the Word Festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theater's capacity.
Presented by Félix V. Romeo, he found before him a dedicated public who had a very short-lived memory of the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "pleasure to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes in "intensive manner" and his work "disciplined"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more dissatisfied", so he asked the writers "not to abandon frivolity" and "assume their responsibility."
The climate diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco that also runs out of regions
The celebration of regions that closed the subscription of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended in the morning yesterday, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have ended with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to be celebrated.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face an imprisonment of Castilblanco
Only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and left on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sold his two asters with greetings and an ear, which granted more stretches than his bullfight.
Even worse was El Juli, which passed through the thing of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a job of relief he won the outrage of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they take flight.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of <0xC3><0x81>lava carried out a transport control on the N-1, as they passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the edge, at which point its two occupants set off to flee the race through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hash packs, so they proceeded to transfer them to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the license plate had been "folded" since it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so that the arrestee has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., was transferred to police departments to carry out the corresponding procedures and will be placed at the disposal of the courts in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Medication
The actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the series Melrose Place, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California highway patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4.30pm Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and going backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently at first had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “he was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was ruled out from the outset, although "as officers observed at first glance, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison around 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where she was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing favors to relatives.
"For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," Llamazares said about the action that the party must adopt with the councilor in the Seville council.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: "IU has always defended that these types of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same line, he stressed that the formation has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Blood of May', Garci's Epic Bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading a large cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours of duration.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci says he has fulfilled this filming "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2 in Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that has contributed in its entirety the Community of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a foolish Spain that was mistaken as a boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not have funding such as Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de Mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Volver a empezar, has focused on what is his usual way of working, staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and those who do not cast, for it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the job of the director lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Nominated for the Oscars on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Sangre de Mayo itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he has assured.
With this movie Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay homage to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented women’s free movement.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was incredible."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I’ve been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the character of maturity.
I am happy that she has agreed to act in my play and I am very honored by it.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were always divas in love, and who are always in love.
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less values her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 20,30 hours at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That chop of light", which was inaugurated last May and that, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, will travel to New York during the International Congress.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, in the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very ill.
Still, it was a hit for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better thanks to his existence.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, in fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you remain, you do not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon’s formal enemy and advocated for lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation set up in honor of his overdosed eldest son to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The blast wave of admiration swept Hollywood without addressing nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, verified that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no more and no less than the height of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"It has set us all very high," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live the way Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity and a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He divorced once but then was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had plenty of opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that his daughters on earth coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that an Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it’s been the worst race by far I’ve been in.
A bunch of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as an assessment and I examined, would be a very clear suspense.
But let’s go by parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the collection of the bib number, which makes you have to go before.
Which I don’t think is bad, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the bib (first nonsense, go just for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a tiny thing compared to the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the booth.
I think that about 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a breakthrough of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) according to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will attend to him soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been much talk of a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many programs associated with it.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loads of commercial junk, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never disappear but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts just to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
I took the photo of this post in one of Microsoft’s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soda machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but in the end, rather throwing in 2010.
Microsoft will surely be looking for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to take a toll.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that stout pointed mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's cotton interior t-shirt, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglophones call, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, by its buzzing name - though familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
Although it is a pity to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her huge resemblance to her sister has not prevented her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch the women how they are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have many ties in common.
Since I was a child I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to dig into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you get the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You turned 30 not long ago, did you get into a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because the body asks me to be and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movies, you’re looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I'm looking forward to the release of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they look like...
A few days ago you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went on a runway to be a model.
She simply called Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization Women for a Better World and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm sticking with that very good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to make the pine, then so too.
For benefiting third-world women, whatever it takes.
Repeated drivers for alcohol must install the 'alcoock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was already announced last June and now appears included in the annual report of the Attorney General of the State, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the Attorney General of Segurida Vial, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving return to the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abs; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce by up to 65% the violations during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they lead to criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary way, and, however, the necessary reform by the criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install on school buses this system, as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time scheduled in the program, landed in the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico City the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can not go to the airport to load at that time... She is from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but lived here a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport glued to the red carpet and to a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salve of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane in the wind, very sober, does not use his usual 'peep-toes', perhaps he had been informed that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before going to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best gifted prize of fashion
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award, than Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont-vivent living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango shop window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried of excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the event, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a heart broken with grief and a heart full of guts, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut the breath, and from the arm of his son Luis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to Baron de Rotchil, without jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with trousers and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed with a black long sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the rehearsal room of ballet and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a hideout of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the palace premises, but before she showed us on the mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Martinez - another cannon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself wrapped up in the hectic rhythm imposed by today’s life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Regardless of yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each person's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores with Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone feels that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this manual denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking Sleepy
Some kids talk at night.
I do not mean those who wake up very smart telling us something that has happened the day before, but children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, you might be scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign disturbance of sleep that is called sleep apnea.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one person has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal bedwetting or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be so.
As we have already mentioned before, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or quite the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What you can do is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the somnilochias appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what has happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not be tempted to interrogate him to get information.
You will achieve nothing, because when you are asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thought.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes children to be anxious.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal chances and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The rhythm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Capt. Kauffmann, who skirted the squadron with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern almost took the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or Diebold also came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we would not let the midfielder pass and we would only leave Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt from Diebold (53').
But the Illhousiens scorer will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the 11 Illhousiens who stepped back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major flash, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a roundabout in Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet there their representatives.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the increase in the prices of diesel, which marks a record reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the employment and remuneration conditions of sailors."
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to slow traffic in Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A " filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination Monday by burning, by scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the oxen remained in port, or Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of trade vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges in the afternoon.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting of the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " , announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a boat can be reached only with a diesel with a price of less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 0.30 per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and a Fate " has died of cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the global economy.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to the US monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its loan of $ 85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to secede include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times continues.
AIG must quickly build up liquidity to repay its $85 billion Federal Reserve loan at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it with the right proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock market of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The tech-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55, according to the closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the plan to save the banks that would have allowed some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was denied the media he was asking for.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how far the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late."
"If the project is really dying... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, N. of the Net) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every passing day announces the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms. Piegza underlined.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” added the analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell 3.632 percent, from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell 4.161 percent, from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House followed another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to curb his low in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday concedes Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidacy member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, underlining the "naivety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without being disconcerted, he was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States to the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," a Democratic television ad that reproached the Republican for failing to consider the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans said this weekend.
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the character most capable of saving the economy that is on the brink of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," said Sen. Charles Schumer, an influential Democrat.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still reduce taxes by 95 percent of Americans despite the upheavals of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a system of safety and health.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, both candidates dodged issues relating to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centers in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator, he has to resign."
Some admit not to having voted: “for what, because they will do what they want with my vote,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face to foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect a democratic change.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," said Yuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive branch.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stresses that turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? " he asks Social-Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five deputies from the opposition to the parliament, those who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulated him on his success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, it regained the public confidence that had been seriously hesitated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this tragedy and the discontent of the public, in February 1994 the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster would not occur again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his report, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” says Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, we have regained the public’s trust,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population had now confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "confidence is an extremely fragile thing."
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus and not antibodies against the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk of certain donors being infected unknowingly and not being able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means we’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before anyone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries," says the head of management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average comprises only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons in good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since current life is very rampant, we rarely find time to spend an hour to donate her blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago, the bench placement of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and we are expected to draw more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” as Héma-Québec doesn’t have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL first division playoff series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) victory at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who defeated Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the return game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps agreed to the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The number one Canadian trio is ready to embark on the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian to the barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warned the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play at his best in the first half, scored Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The prime minister does not exclude starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party’s general council ends, Jean Charest went to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected during today’s by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern frontier”: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force remaining in the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it appear that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe, and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister nevertheless limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "twice as big territory as France," "is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, after taking a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North," he said of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec Ungava party), have already started consultations in about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to party power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central at the Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
“From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, to Lesage that made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative one, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," he told his militants, sparking applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems in being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular demanded recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also wished that Quebec should appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they should have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced applying it.
If he had, "we would have made progress today," Ms Marois said alongside her candidate at Jean-Talon (vote today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec’s Democratic Action appeared to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To thus dishonor this woman who fought a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what it says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are reproached to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and allows a child soldier to live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who runs into false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We do not yet realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that is the word that Harper keeps repeating and that makes no sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far a minority wants (what will happen after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government gave up what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company tried a six-million-euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecutions for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit has little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will gag the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to examine the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually made for the exchange of ideas and not with clubs.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate while disregarding his views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word only refers to high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so mostly because it rejects the mining company’s brutal way.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes in arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a chase-gag (in pursuit of "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a petition with respect to the authors of Noir Canada instructing them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate about the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the elect of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for non-payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Sen. Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards a deal that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," she said.
"It's the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on Americans' daily lives will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a new failure in the investor mood.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential election, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable to the agreement, without forgetting however to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the deal, particularly the one that would allow owners to keep their domicile and the one about the wages of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no congratulations.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to overtake.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan seeks to buy with taxpayers’ money the doubtful debts, risky and non-sellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
It’s a group of Republican elected officials who had changed the first draft of the deal last week.
We believe we have emerged from the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to smooth the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that can be re-sold when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures of embargoes that concerned the housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and on the cash compensations paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “with all evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that consists in taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is the cheerleader for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to hurry and carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was resigning to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
Instead, we regained a voting right in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
The American actor with a charming smile had freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the register of power that the true sacred monsters have.
What a great running back!
Paul Newman, who died Friday of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in recent years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he resembled much and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality mark.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied the dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before succeeding in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This civil rights man was also the auto driver who qualified in second place in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although a member of a modeling couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to scandals of the show business that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman stirred up vertigo for moviegoers this weekend as his big roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art parades through it.
Many memories come back to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Tennessee Williams adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This Rocky Graziano boxer, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic manganant in the sumptuous film The Sting (The Strike), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and avenging billiards player in Robert Rossen’s superb film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
The young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Coen Brothers' Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as Irish mafia godfather in Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who abandoned the career quite early, Newman stayed a long time in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendours and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in " the underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young gallant than of a marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or despairers, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed his not-so-well-known sides of true pudic sensitivity.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, depicted a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former partner in arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: "My life and my country were better thanks to his existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen much of his face reigning over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The proceeds of these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained these phrases: "every time, to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant harm, of business mode, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, they used for their own purposes the funds obtained in public tenders, often justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were false.
To do this they obtained the booklets in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question of which company should make the counterfeit invoice was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public grants.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the fancy invoice makers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. gastronomic center because in its bookstore - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and was shown the invoices, he already knew they were fake documents.
"On the stamp our company name and NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, it was also not agreed that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the invoice for payment in cash they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices of the agency.
In addition – as was known during the investigation – they included in the document VAT as well, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from tax.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine but the invoice was manual.
In addition the "senders" have made other errors also, as in the case of a company in which they put on the bill as activity realized the road transport to which - it is known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not the company founded as investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously sent out the invoices
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way, Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices. In 2003 it supplied invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyeslet Economic Association.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The next group of manufacturers of fake invoices includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictitiously based Delta Trio SL in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade issued a total of 15 invoices to various entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution found that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF respectively from the contest, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
To keep this from being discovered, five dummy invoices received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will likely report at trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the counterfeiting of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant himself, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this he has not done to the present.
The question is: what interest does it have to do it?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of the majority of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was denied repeatedly.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far greater value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of Overlapping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have discovered the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment were examined by the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games the participants could win money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the nervous system’s “self-reward” mechanism.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the real value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For until now they explained the phenomena of auctions solely with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's faculty of economics.
Hepatitis: When should I go to the doctor?
Some 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves with vaccines against the viruses A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a poor general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and on the white of the eyes jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the urine dark in color and the healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die in the world from liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most severe forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical monitoring is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check-up as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of investigations in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the 17th-century Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and Leonardo da Vinci’s 15th-century Lady of the Hermine.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics said that looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "they were reassured and in their heart reigned peace."
When looking at the religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when looking at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for which they feel very positively, as for a mother or a father," - said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results there remains only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his stature?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday Google can say: you can find it both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “Let’s gather all the information of the world in one system!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world upside down is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question of what will happen five years from now, Schmidt said: “I would like Google to be able to answer questions like ‘What to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What would be the job that would suit me best?’ – however, software won’t be able to answer seemingly simple questions as long as there isn’t enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that while browsing the Web the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages they visited at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches -in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases it is rather the potential represented by the company that can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that not only preserve, but in justifiable cases also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
Internet users who care about people’s rights, on the other hand, were relieved in May when the company, together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the sentence, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get under the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
The opinion on Google is quite contradictory: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed by starting to use Google’s services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about intentionally leaving footprints behind us and taking advantage of available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even combine them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then you can include them in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which automatically appear the latest photo galleries that are stored on the Pilick.
We can know numerous cases from which it turns out that for example the bride, when she sees the flow of photos the next morning of common friends, finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the management of the company: one thing is for sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person’s “online” life is what she shows of herself – this is the definition that lurks behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do so (beginning for example with Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but you can replace the "online" applications of Google, from the text-writing software to the applications of image and news reading with alternative versions which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public expects almost openly the day when Google will show its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more quickly also cause serious headaches to numerous other companies not only for the Microsoft, but also for Microsoft.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the top management strongly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of the company's nursery, considered too expensive the unlimited number of feeding of employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the Chinese Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company violated the moral information according to the agreement.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it was already ready to operate, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to turn the World upside down: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines from Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by our Supreme Court with our own analysis of the United States.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for writers of sci-fi works, the Scroogled, novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which a man only of the data of Google can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, according to substantiated suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime, the spokesman for the Borsod province’s General Police Commission said on Tuesday.
The girls acknowledged the crime they were accused of, and are now accused of perpetrating the crime.
The two minors - according to reports from the Hungarian News Agency it is two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people premeditatedly and out of greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI reports, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested by the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Major European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a “second 9/11.”
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president - the Republic of Rome believes - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, which aims to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “Second 9/11.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, it was the mistake of the political direction of the United States that brought the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing, and this will then have repercussions on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts at wobbly financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if as the dominoes crumble more bank still, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, EU member states need to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are increasingly real concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU so far has not seriously dealt with the crisis that passes like a cuname through the Old Continent.
The "saviors" won't have to immediately file hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
Take bumblebees, for example.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C-type robotic car steering system imitating nature, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, chief technology officer of PR and development and research.
Composite eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a 180-degree angle, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the robot in the vehicle would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Lab and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in a flash.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and the acceleration in addition to the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, much less the storage.
This device every second only needs to process a few input signals and react as appropriate.
There is no need to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which according to Nissan calculations, within ten years will be able to be incorporated into mass-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging existing obstacles in his way.
He already has a name for this dear boy.
The written version of the $700 billion financial bailout package law has been prepared to be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
Half of the money will be spent in the first phase.
According to East Coast timetable during further consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion total bailout package, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic congressional chairwoman, saying the deal was only formalized in one document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Finance Minister, speaking about the outcome of the compromise stated: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but turning the chariot of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the bill called the 2008 emergency bill for economic stabilization, the U.S. Congress will vote first on Monday, and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, on this sum, the Finance Ministry will buy bonds with bad credit ratings and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special agency, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and securities credit fund securities, in addition to other "poisonous" loans as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying items, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: the law secures the necessary financial means, which can even reach up to 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it, he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and waiting for the aid of the state can count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang simply calls parachutes of gold.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses’ compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal cap on CEOs’ incomes will be in place, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional commission responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they will even be able to make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill, in the next five years the president will have to present to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
“This is not what American citizens have entrusted us with, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected,” Republican Congressman Darrell Issa said.
Ohio’s Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were urged by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors rose minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest increase in price magnitude occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 per cent), primarily due to a 4.6 per cent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 per cent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemicals production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electrical machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion "practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic system of access and control on the other side of the Atlantic".
At the same time, he warned that the entry premise will disappear in the new system, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing him the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the presidential candidates’ international policy advisers, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for president of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, while politicians are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several-day marathon-type negotiations, announced early on Sunday: a principled agreement was reached on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rivals of pulling the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues in the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared the McCain advantage he had obtained after the Republican convention with the candidacy of Sarah Palin for the vice presidency.
At a campaign rally in Detroit last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly ... employment, savings and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are at risk,” he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to swallow this hard... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a commission of control to the minister of fines and the limitation of compensation of executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congressional Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a black-and-white coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German leftist magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours Its Parents", he analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social-Christians had been developing Bavaria for several decades - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday it ended a process that had been predicted for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU got 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the Bundestag elections of 2005, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in the rhythm they made a lot of mistakes. However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities, and it also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious, the most critical and the most stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who distanced themselves the most from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those with high school and the graduates.
Thus, less than 40 percent of support for the CSU was withdrawn.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, while the Greens still do not wish to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely showed anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left pending the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started today in Paris, its host is France, which is also this year the President of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that affect gypsy children and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the group of Fidesz deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, gypsies are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
"Most young Roma have not finished middle school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, these issues need to be widely raised among both Roma and non-Roma people.
For the earlier a Gypsy student starts school, the more likely he or she will be to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - stressed Livia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for which the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer gypsy children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting under the banner of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a unique forum for promoting the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision on the fate of the unsuccessful Huber-Beckstein duo will be made at the end of October
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, are still in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much criticized duo gave a glimpse: they do not hold on so much to their positions.
In doing so, they sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – though under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career – the social-Christian union reached 60.7 percent, while now, a year after the cramped coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria which gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, federal agriculture minister, one of Huber’s possible successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that is starting negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors over a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Electors enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the blow of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will receive an active role Stoiber also that so far has been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the Berlin grand coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to deal with the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition deputies in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the welfare and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of one hundred and ten deputies, has no opposition more than a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of some opposition "to the constitutional amendment this time"
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give a high-level anti-political regime to have Lukashenko and other politicians.
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, in assessing the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
In the opinion of the opposition, however, the political climate is improving: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears to allow the entry of even one opponent in that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests when it sees the results, but rather tries to get the voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This of course causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in its distribution, but even so I see that more and more those who support the change among the adults also - said Milinkevich, alluding to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that its main result is the creation of the social security regime, do not consider it adequate even the most officially retired.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increasing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people do not believe in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on he eats breakfast before he starts working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of personnel.
but from today it starts with this measure against those who sign and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This news has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," says the minister.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency opens up.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, says the secretary-general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on their part."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and half-moons.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences due to illnesses of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people to work in a year".
He added that it is necessary to make the public administration more effective.
In Italy, "which wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate".
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the Brunetta decree rules by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism from work due to illness – writes the association of consumers – the people of the ‘lazy workers’ is in continuous increase.
In Italy, there are millions of correct and productive civil servants who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.
In particular, the Tar will address the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extension of the time slots in which the medical check-up visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people are killed and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalided by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of public opinion".
A sincerely shared 'enough' has been expressed in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted at school for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work take on particular significance.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a resolute effort to urgently put an end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil chairman Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this “tendency to decline” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - for what concerns the communication and the awareness of the public opinion.
But above all, there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistive diversion to which the system is heading in recent years".
"The objective is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the one who is injured does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator each time".
MP3 Players Under Accusation Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to music at high volumes for a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
In a statement issued in Brussels, the European Commission cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at a high acoustic level may unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific evidence emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
“The scientists confirm that this is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of levels and of the time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week they exceed the limit currently in force concerning the maximum noise consented in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germano gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno tends to underline – It should provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There are no roles left, only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March finished the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
To whom the Commission accuses of useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that back and forth manifest themselves.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to make participate and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For Alemanno, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we absolutely need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He has written a well-known American politician who is interested in going independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two black governors and five black senators!”
In reality, they are attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi diary, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth we will know who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mindset comes out covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Iraq has also been Bush’s weak spot for most.
Whoever assumes the position of George W will have a huge duty to fulfill.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They do not feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by most of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are opening a gap on the Internet, for many viewed as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn of has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope “that it will do something good” for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between those who run the newspapers—that is, the editors—and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The “safe work” at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors almost always get good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "sicken" often throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the area of the investigation into the counter-pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company be able to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans were, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate, pro-federal institutions and business community soul, and its new, conservative, hostile soul to “the Washington people” and the financial world, strong above all in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, has become overbearing with the vow of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This just quoted is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary revival, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions – it would finance which have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of the families who live in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divided between different interests and different state strategies, fails to decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment the cut is reached, it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market will probably and no organization will ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the increasingly sophisticated network of technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to reckon more and more with the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things which, you see, can certainly be transported from one place of the earth to another but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly has many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate economic relief with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in various parts of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites until now booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, to have made time itself and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, underground feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest itself in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus also in the right-wing (Britain's) victory against the rebels.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today is taking shape are the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially in excess.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn’t.
The super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters the scientists have been able to have glued a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect grip.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time "takes off easily from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher in the faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING AROUND THE WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through walls exactly like Spider-Man? Layers do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley in California is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro-fibers like hair that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing according to the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain drugs, reducing the health effects of certain drugs.
Grapefruit juice was already under indictment because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
The same Italian agency of the drug had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY THE CUP – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "These findings in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the brochures illustrating the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist ", stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of commerce and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days Enron was breaking, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggered much controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that has now proved accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset at how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "great value economist", but also a popularizer with a style "very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from the home to the office to the professionals of the public administration, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by the volunteer developers, whose backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Attention also paid to the multi-functionality with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for dissemination in homes, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows you to work in the database; and lastly Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that so far we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best jersey of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth third-generation EPO-positive runner, after Italy’s Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and Germany’s Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests of Kohl’s champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy, from an immigrant country, has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants who are welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has dedicated to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times calls the “Northern Paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the Northern League.
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked by both the pope and the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked that the state and the church work together to combat racism."
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to bear - explains the head of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of generalized increase even for residents".
Apart from that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limit of canon, linked sub rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Bologna Square) you ask about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed they serve 250/350 euro, at least 350 for an individual.
in the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU citizens is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic rooms
The historical cinemas close favoring multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom one shared a piece of place and so much emotion", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that was always lost.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the most are mostly the cinemas of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, it is these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it would be useful if new structures were built but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the mono-room cinema both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
Among the planned rules there are mediated tax facilitation in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the zone of limited traffic and will have special rates for parking.
'It is an initiative I like,' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the meticons, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and the image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the cosca Piromalli".
The charges that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and the vice mayor of Goia Giorgio Tauro Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested was Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer of the same name, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Contemplating any legal and moral norm, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed - the judges write - to officially enter the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
The arrests this morning are added to those last July after police announced the cutting of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged constraints between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor, of the UdC at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question the deputy minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political question, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even gone so far as to ask for the variation of the project of the A3 road.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniformizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of mafia families".
When the energy is born of the waves, the great ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s along with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of oil was low, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil are giving the sector momentum.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electrical need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the sea waves.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are more and more and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesperson for a company associated with the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increase in interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, pending only the federal approval, apart from the energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on New York’s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Power, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It’s mostly tidal energy that states like New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
