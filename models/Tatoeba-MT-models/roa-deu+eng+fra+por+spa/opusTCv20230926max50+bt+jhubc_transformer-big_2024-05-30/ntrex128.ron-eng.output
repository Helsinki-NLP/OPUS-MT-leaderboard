Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they could give the impression that they are "puppet"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed that they have been suggested to change their title, namely to be called MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that it "ride with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "obtuse" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party in the National Assembly of Wales said that overall the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group had an "open" attitude towards changing its name, but also noted that "MWP" resembled "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales the same as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them wanted to use the ‘Wales Parliament’.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, the chairman of the governing committee, a headache, who is expected to submit the draft amendment bill within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly shall have the last word as to their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Change of Country Name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on changing the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Episcopal Church have stopped bells as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I spoke with told me that before, there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars and no more churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer serve as the living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And as for the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore, this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who were carrying out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of poor men."
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it as "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, said it was the first carillon in the world operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" on to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in the engagement of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency shown by the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Trying to Catch Lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy crying for help and then moved along with a group who helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was delighted to catch a lobster, but then realized he was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
authorities restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s retailer plans to strengthen its position in the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing department stores with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn strengthening of the UK beauty market, which continues to grow, although home and fashion sales are not up to par, larger sections of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be integrated into more stores in the next year if they prove successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in a context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s representatives said the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most products are aimed at vegans, a demand increasingly met among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s retailer, said outlets will look more and more like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the battle with big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments has failed.
Sainsbury attempted to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a disagreement over how to split the revenues of Boots stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s retailer, said: “We have transformed the look of our departments with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Angry After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle contract with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show “Dragons‘ Den”, retiring at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angered when one of the most beloved people on television on Tuesday admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allow her to devote herself to their brand accesso, Truly's case, which includes
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would quit his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's top priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, there was a little bit left until the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” host, who is among the best-selling celebrities in the UK, could hurt the company by millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay in launching.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then "we fell in love"
He joked about criticism he would receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and about having such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said he imitated a “news anchor” voice.
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have come to a halt.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not noticed a "correct response" from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic point of view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the U.S. military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get into this messy arena, there would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for international relief efforts.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it’s a bit of a difficult situation,” Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the agency’s spokesman for national disasters, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly suffering, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for nature’s fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not found very often on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued to this effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has set out to make improving Indonesia’s precarious infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign and has amplely allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko’s administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sectarian Indonesians as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims quarreled in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores save goal and ties in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 yards from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before kicking in the direction of the goal.
The ball reached over the box, heading towards the top right corner of the goal.
Eventually the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The forward of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the field and ran to Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the box.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday that triggered waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000 people, was covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to the matter to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material using the on-board camera, to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and that she was found on a property.
This afternoon, some people who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are trying to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours before they would be allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
At the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
He repeatedly said, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another one was outside it.
Several police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a direct message to police <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention the case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial affected by altercations over "rewriting history"
Removing it would represent poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical puritanical followers.
But Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about removing statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of continuous historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
A pig killed a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was cut and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui Square in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of South China's Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he had come with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring hut was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The coroner confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer’s death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were full of blood and torn,” the cousin, whose last name is “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing its intensity as it moves to the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa is experiencing wind conditions at 85 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressive area over the Pacific Ocean has begun to form and is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressive zone will generate heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration as a result of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds in gusts and dust.
The approaching depressive zone will bring torrential rains to areas off the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second half of Sunday and early part of Monday, before more rain spread Monday evening and Tuesday.
Intense rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures as high as 27 degrees in extended areas from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high above-average temperature chances for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the press statement backed by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations disrupting Friday’s regular schedule for breaking news: an agreement reached between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford told the court she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had harassed her while she was drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100 percent sure this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters yelled at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He looked down for a few minutes as people scolded him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote live on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to look into the allegations against the nominee the following week, as demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was largely convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his front page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, the 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released footage of the confrontation between The Sims and Simpson, and police said The Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked police for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 1.98-metre-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater started and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors multiple rumblings and vibrations.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that lies 72 km southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Fighting between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from the gendarmes bombed them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The fighting intensified later, with the police using their canes to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” while union protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region seeking independence a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent riots taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite a vital but close victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties tried to keep up the momentum this year, with many of the world’s best-known leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in holding the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate in the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in the Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and even the building.
Apparently, at one point, a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped the Livingston team win 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unresponsive, with Steven Gerrard making his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played on equal footing with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains without a away win in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, being behind them by eight points next Sunday.
Prior to this, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against gruesome visitors
Holt's team should have moved on long before they scored, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and try to kick into the space of the goal, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after slipping in to intercept the ball headed by Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors on free kicks.
And that’s how the crucial gap came in.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston made an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to care for Menga, who kicked and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but faced impenetrable defense from the host, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not greatly disturbed for the remainder of the match.
This pattern of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow gave a wide shot from another Livingston player.
Diagonal passes continued to come in Livingston's box, but unsuccessfully, and the two penalty kicks - after Halkett bullied Glenn Middleton and after a shot - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and team have not changed at all since returning to the top, but the credit must be given to Holt for the way he has coached his team since taking over.
He had so many patterns to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspiring.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
Goals were unsuccessful, they managed only once to catch the opponents' free gate, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies from collision with a car
A cyclist died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes just months after another biker died in an accident on Childers Street in which the driver ran away from the scene, which is about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access to the area is restricted, buses are diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in brawl
Six officers from the prison were injured in a brawl at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a brawl broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the brawl, in which eight inmates are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized staff has been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after being injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, officers dealing with the riots were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result)
A tropical depression rarely happens in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy resources will be used in the southwestern desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, with precipitation falling on the second half of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state over a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including in the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total quantities possible up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas the torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona faces at least one severe drought, the second largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and therefore will diminish.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
“Torrent rains are expected to range from 8 to 10 cm” from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 25 cm,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a National Hurricane Center official said.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden flooding, which will endanger people’s lives, and will bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and one 20-year-old boy were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who might have materials on their mobile phone, respectively to report to the police station.
Trump says Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" from Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had faced “discontent and anger” from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying claims by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her ten years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw that day the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but in a way I’m a candidate,” he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion everywhere about the candidates I consider to be outstanding.”
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, numbers on the rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when six-meter-high waves hit the beach at dusk, taking people by the waters and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting shore.
He added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the lines continued to shake the coastal town.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s strong earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographic structure of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, as well as the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was criticized for failing to inform that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching to the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, hindering the coordination of rescue efforts by authorities.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basic things.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the Palu evacuation centers for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are staying in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though relief groups have started disaster relief efforts, some people have complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a calamity if it is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s another provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international relief efforts, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of Friday’s Palu earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing were hoping that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, coached for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliders.
Other of the captives at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience with paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of paragliders, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But there was only one gray tick next to his messages, not two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t transmitted,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while fueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was fueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “flew through the back of the employee Brink” and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye"
Kanye West changes his stage name to “Ye”
He made the announcement on Twitter on Saturday: "The individual officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it “for emotional reasons,” the show’s producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he discussed the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m new, it’s about us.
It all started with “Kanye,” which means the one, and it all came down to “Ye,” which is a reflection on our good, bad, and unclear things, and on the whole.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are as people.”
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with a screenplay, sometimes without, as well as in large letters.
President of Mexico vows not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military forces against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the marketplace on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of artificial intelligence who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government officials made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated U.S. player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated past competitions from U.S. governments in the field of technology, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when it will be next, to help identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China putting sticks in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think it should automatically be offered visas to doctoral students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes to U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a Commission on National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday if they want the country's name changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", a move that would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece, which was opposed to its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposing nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on voter turnout, with the minimum 50% threshold needed to validate the referendum possibly not being reached.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: “Are you in agreement with joining the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, has to pay in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of those with the right to vote voted.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the country’s capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which will allow it to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small-sized stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents erected by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted under the name of Macedonia, we can move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, below the required number of participants.
According to another poll, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for the change.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manages to pass the entire Brighton defensive and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to get past Brighton's defense and scored a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like it was incredibly easy for Aguero to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly between three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free end of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overtook several opposing players on the edge of Brighton's box.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English forward sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
“Aguero has a few problems with his feet,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Blues in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on the territory of Brighton at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the goal.
The attacker hit the ball to the net just before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there was not much reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the play-offs for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but they are still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open Sunday's match, but according to sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer take the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of the 34th game, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw under normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the state of affairs regarding the Supreme Court’s decision on Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All of our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the great ones, I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate, that’s why I try my best to support the good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this awful, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we won’t give it away.”
He also said that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “angry and mean, naughty and liars.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was heavily ousted by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
What's that?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute — that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
I was not at all surprised that the Momentum activists of my local party supported the no-confidence motion as far as I was concerned.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, has received similar treatment because she has been vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which even Jeremy did not have common views with previous leaders.
The statement for the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For much of his eight-year tenure as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever fulfilled.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged by what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things started to be like that when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision on politics started to expect me to change my mind and agree with some things that I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there follows a wave of abuses on desocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing the politics of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this aspect.
Many people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything “will be fine” that way.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the neglect of the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or minister.
I never hid my political views, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues with which I disagree in relation to the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that as the country moves towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to send is not to the Momentum group in Nottingham, but to citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the end result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today’s highly interactive match in Tennent’s Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, being the only team without any loss of the ten.
Ultimately, it all boiled down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the odds that came up, which helped the host team and pleased coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve had several tests during our matches so far and we continue to be unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of chances more than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave the Ayr team an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, while playing for the Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, right in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field with his stretcher, and since the re-start of the game, Ayr has been unleashed through the trial of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an undisturbed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card because he struck Climo without a ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the attempt, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry deep into the fifth attempt of the host team.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom Still Game, looks set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's beloved show, writing the screenplay and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, number nine, would be the last, and it appears that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source at the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "developing restaurant industry".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivian island hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a crane-filled naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no waterfront, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive outlook,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia — who faces a controversial fight for next year’s re-election — also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it happened.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that this case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has Bolivia been unsuccessful, but it is possible that the last four years have turned it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents—used the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "unreal dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the Korean War-ending declaration would ever make the northern territory give way.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you’re looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Unpractical hats conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent out the creations that steal your eyes from the podium.
Valentino’s signature piece was an extravagant beige hat with a wide, feather-like bow, in which the models’ ends sank.
Other oversized accessories included beaded melons, a sorcerer’s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessory, rather than haute couture.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of clothing, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Stylists predict a return of huge caps in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats return after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat, the wide-bored straw hat, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the unpractical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bag, with a size as large as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raphia bag, with raphia fringes and a white leather handle, was the staple of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland hold a record for academic excellence, and this has continued into 2018 with another set of outstanding exam scores, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for fighting for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only two-digit language spoken, 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Having more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be multiple languages of choice within independent schools, with teachers who are specialized in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play still remains to be settled.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
Time of Trump’s West Virginia election rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at places where voters are favourable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court vacancy candidate is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
President Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week was to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
“The fact that the president has come to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA Shows Determination and Continues Fighting to Maintain Chance for Singles Starting Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible that Saturday afternoon’s foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but players really believe in it, all the more so in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were leading us by six points, now the gap is only four points, so we’re relying on this drop for a bit of motivation,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are twelve more points at stake.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green zone with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive guttural howls became louder and louder as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point that tied the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The shot he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar howl, a howl that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The odd but adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four matches and it seems they can’t fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any extra hits on Saturday afternoon, but that's true for Saturday morning, and Friday afternoon, and even the nine Friday morning spots.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they were to carry out a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An extra shot and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and Swede into a pit so deep that they weren’t even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursome samples are fascinating and worth watching closely due to the interactions between pairs, the tips given and not given, and the way a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, something that some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after finishing Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over a hesitant Tiger Woods, raising their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the morning fourballs event and won the series with a 3-1 score.
The U.S. put up a more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games, but was unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 straight games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points from four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they supported each other magnificently to defeat the discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in Saturday's two games, had occasional sparks of genius, but so far has lost 19 of the 29 fourballs and foursome games, seven of which were consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome event and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world, 2-1.
Europe did not, however, have an unhindered journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2–1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes after losing their first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is “no chance” of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the global council that North Korea had implemented “significant measures to prove its good faith” last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site, and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and under such circumstances, we can’t unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri echoed North Korea's familiar objections to Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered assurances on North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to heed calls for easing harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States is insisting on the ‘denuclearization first’ option and is increasing the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
In contrast, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, in the last five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these circumstances, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from that of last year’s speech, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with missiles from North Korea was inevitable after “Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterruptedly until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the corridors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go very well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but just hours later North Korea denounced him as making “gang threats.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them undergo “all night” learning sessions energized with plenty of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students at the world’s most prestigious university often don’t even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants and books to be told what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know that we can’t change students’ behavior instantly.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” Czeisler said.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling at this institution where competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm to know when it’s time to go to bed, as well as for waking time, and to know what the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs are, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer from another case of depression on the move as Dolly Menga's shot condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to secure their first away win since their 4–1 victory over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to deliver Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a coach, placing the Rangers eight points behind the authoritarian leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers players never seemed to be able to tie.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian, by a single goal.
And the Rangers could face other problems, as coughing referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the lawn of the visiting team’s fans.
Gerrard traded eight players from the batch that he easily won against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get an equaliser with the Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained batch suffocated his opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the goal defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow sent her past the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they hoped for more than they trusted their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers had only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingstone's 34th minute goal did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, even for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga, who finished with a single shot.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he traded Ryan Kent for Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centered Morelos, but the impressive Kelly went out of the way to block him.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into the exact same type of match he prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after center.
Holt's team could have extended their lead into the finals, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs's shot, then Lithgow headed past the corner goal.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty towards the end of the game when he hit the Jacobs but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count CONTINUES...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with unlikely inclinations towards science:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Yes, there’s a lot of buzz!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to ‘Detect’ Harmful Cells
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “Detect” Harmful Cells and Destroy Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then are reinjected
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells also worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe in support of Trump while wearing a MAGA cap after appearing on SNL.
It didn't go too well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he planned to run in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star teased Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although it was not aired, West's diatribe footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to take West for granted with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out wearing this hat.’
I was assaulted!
They also told me that I was very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how low I got?" and then he said, "I'm going to grab my Superman cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments drew public buzz at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on the team told the publication: "There was a complete silence in the studio."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FAVOURING THE GLOVE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the presentation of these roles on screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks “something wrong has happened” and wondered how toxic masculinity can be handled in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, said he was "very determined" to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men about being adults, given the problem we’re facing now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through highly masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because it is clear that something wrong has happened with the young people.”
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play in any kind of Game of Thrones-based series after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that "it's finished with the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that has happened to him thanks to Game of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I did this show, so it secured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senators' data, talks about 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
WASHINGTON (AP) — Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and "far-right" websites.
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information included the addresses and personal phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a judge on the Supreme Court.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented the information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they don’t have to be angry.
He doesn't have to be defiant.
They should not question the motive of the accuser.
It has to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who runs against Waters in the midterm election, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office alerted “the appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Johnny English hits again: spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson in the lead role
It has become a tradition to search for Brexit-related meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action-movie parody series that has the main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Can this scoffing satire of how strange we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent, stare-eyed, rubber-faced spy, has been renewed for the second time to spoil everything. The character’s name means, first and foremost, that it’s a general comedic creation for cinema audiences in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the raunchy secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip from that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire musical theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious landless man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet slightly.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and, strangely enough, superfluous, especially since "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or Mission Impossible, confidently provide comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to target children more than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and clever as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the UK’s super-secret spy web and revealed the identities of the British undercover agents, to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a pompous and besieged prime minister, who is already suffering a serious crisis because of the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English's own zevzezek, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, but also giving lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute stutters, because English runs a School of Rock-style academy of spies.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then reunited with his old partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of his Majesty's Secret Service messing up come back into action, taking on the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech industry billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of bachelorette adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a trendy French restaurant, creates chaos as they sneak aboard Volta’s luxury vessel, then English triggers anarchy in pure form as he tries to use a familiar set of virtual reality glasses for Volta’s virtual reality.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film, it looks like a children's television production.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop asking myself: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies plans for Britons to work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has a radical plan that would only work four days a week but pay for five days.
It appears the party wants company bosses to take advantage of possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not change.
The sources say the idea would “match” with the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of workers.
The shift to the four-day workweek is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source at the head of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “Announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a fitting aspiration in the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall strategy on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
The shadow cabinet’s Lord Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiteers” from utility companies.
The shadow cabinet lord chancellor’s plans also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supplying kings may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could collect “deductions” due to found crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the boards of directors of companies and create property funds through which to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on '60 Minutes' whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh would make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI’s findings.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his colleague in South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I’ve said that since the beginning of the hearings; I’ve spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Are you guilty?’
The answer was decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be carved out of stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would take some explosive charges,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly dismisses the charges,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: to eradicate global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to Central Park, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls, or other significant things that help increase global elimination awareness.
But what was the success of the Global Citizen Festival when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism,” which refers to people who feel they have accomplished something by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
These actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, for which at least $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a 'blockade' to hamper Russia's energy exports, Home Secretary says
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s engagement in Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to broker the sale of energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not come to the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying Russia “knows only one trick” because of the fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The remarks come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the U.S.’s fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic motives and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at it the same way: energy can’t be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. energy secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state intervening in matters concerning our energy,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘seriously thinks’ about running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she had to “seriously think” about running for president after the midterm election.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that it takes a strong woman,” she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run for president."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the mayor’s meeting, saying he had “directed the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that not even most of Warren’s voters believe he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy by him and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator.
Biden said it would be formally decided by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things my own son went through after he came back ... I can understand the suffering of other families who are experiencing the ramifications of post-traumatic stress disorder and the aftermath of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a supportive rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "return a little different, harder, returning wondering if there is any more respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of domestic violence, and holding a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are advocating a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae application in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to the policy on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law states that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the petition reads.
In addition, lawyers argue in the lawsuit that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, when he announced the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where death toll has doubled, in a race against the clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is soothing her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is inadequate.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded possessions, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale, were overwhelmed by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, are resting outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong and continuous rhythms.
He has tearful eyes when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry out for help, then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Abuse’ of ‘Propaganda Advertisements’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that involves waves of tariff increases on imports.
Tariffs imposed by China as revenge at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, experts in China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When it disseminates propaganda through the publication of an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press,” Branstad writes.
“Instead, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans back and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and the majority of Republicans who have publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
“Such reactions will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November Come!” as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But they could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young 18- to 29-year-old electorate, who, while not liking the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a counter-reaction could follow if the Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has turned into a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, it’s also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group for Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided as to what part they should believe from the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly believe or believe that Ford’s testimony is likely to have been true, while 35 percent said they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Establish a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, schedules, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional instruments.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal consolidation through data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up at once.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The cleric who won the Victory Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church to win a Victoria Cross medal as a combatant in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolically amazing" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under intense artillery and machine gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "fantastic bravery", cleared the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest on his own and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humbled.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got Peppa Pig cartoons instead
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all satisfied, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the children’s cartoon as “some kind of a bad joke.”
“Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Puppy Peppa, yes."
Scott Coker, chairman of Bellator, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be watched by spectators in the UK.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably sort it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’re going to stick to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We’ve tried to give fans more and we’ve crossed the line.
It is an unhappy situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lower' because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to Lauren Laverne’s first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, he said he talks about the rights of gay people to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to an illness.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like boys and girls."
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt differently, it was the real things that gave me the strength and stamina to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of this year’s Commonwealth Games appearance in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was "surprised" by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such an early age,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who’s been through the same good and bad times.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed their “whole perspective.”
“If I was asked last year, I would be interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than the gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t say, ‘You won’t be able to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died did I finally accept that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew I dreamed of that my whole life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympics, there is no more beautiful sensation,” he said.
This also inspired him in his chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, the song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of form, was placed on the reserve bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in the forty-seventh Ryder Cup game, but he will have to return to good form so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S. team, the five-time major-tournament winner split his day between cheerleading for teammates and practicing his shots, hoping he would right what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, not even in the best part of his career, so he’s not the best choice for the narrow court at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish wrong hits.
And if the field isn’t big enough, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who allied with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the start of the 12-game singles, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
“He completely understood the role he had today, he hit me on the shoulder, he hugged me and he told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened and that's how I thought we had to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never rose to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with players, he’s a great guy in the team locker room,” he said.
“I think young players have fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do it during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but he barely managed to defeat them by a minimum difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win," Bjorn said after watching how the 2018 team, which won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We have always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what awaits us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the way his players have handled difficult terrain, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to convey to the players, that it has to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the opposing team’s captain, hopes his players will play better at the singles event than they did with their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe succeeded in the "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like in Brookline, like in Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
We've created the right batch and we've ordered the players as we'd like, you know, we're trying to create a little bit of magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players in that order because I think they cover all the topics,” Bjorn said of the batch for the singles event.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany’s newest navy frigate was supposed to be deployed in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was due to be introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but after-delivery problems affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vessel missiles, as well as stealth technologies that ensure a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to depart on two-year missions without returning to their original port.
However, the continued delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime strength, will already be obsolete before entering service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a vessel to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the warship useless on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important because the ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the vessel was found to be too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton ship Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the German ships used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in Germany’s parliament, acknowledged that the navy “began to run out of vessels that can be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has steadily increased over time as old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced by new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had entered service in the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unusual flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
A habitat map and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating lawns, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting their nests, but also by habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are traps for flies and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct surveys, control the nests, and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species in Scotland are found.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threade, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to multiply.”
It emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on properties, as the mere unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations are evolving for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" in the proportion of "99%", and that he had been betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims she addressed the police and that the photos of her wounds were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that she "would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now seeks to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused of, Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret loss of automakers forever'
Britain "would regret forever" losing its status as the world's leading vehicle manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “worrisome” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix-in-time” principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which, according to industrial manufacturers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than inventory for a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border.”
“There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“Evidence from not just Toyota, but other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be halted, but warned that rising prices could reduce the factory’s long-term competitive capacity and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "Experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs will never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he “would rather not” fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “No date has yet been set for it. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in briefings was not caused by dislike of TV reporters, who like to show themselves, though he added, "I don't deny the fact that they like to show themselves."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president is attending more Q&A sessions than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
"There will be more briefings," Sanders said, "but it's much better for the press to have the opportunity to address questions directly to the president of the United States, not me.
We try to do this most of the time, and you may have noticed that we have done this many times in recent weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available.”
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, making an impromptu appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addresses, in a letter, EU employees at Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) on Brexit fears
The secretary of state wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter with less than six months until the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, with decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no deal for leaving the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday in a game his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the line and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the trainers and medical staff on the toe line, before putting him on a stretcher and transporting him off the field for a thorough assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five tackles in total before leaving the match, reaching a total of 18 tackles throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The court stamp fee will be applied to persons who are not taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of the court stamp fee when buying a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising cheaper homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp court fee will be applied to individuals and legal entities that are not taxpayers in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which adds to the current court stamp fee, including the high levels two years ago for second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an additional up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and puts those wanting to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the court’s stamp fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of buying land but not using it, and called on Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable homes in order to solve Britain’s “household problem.”
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and an end to unmotivated evictions.
It also wants to give the councils greater powers in terms of building new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing existing problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too remote, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be Scotland's national team manager"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his "ultimate goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of "reviving" the northeastern club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved to the Stade de la Lumière team this summer after last season's successful return of St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We made it to the national team B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s games at Hampden with my dad and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I succeed as manager of the club.”
Ross's predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland club, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of club Alloa Athletic said he was not excited to be the successor of such established names at such an important club, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team return to the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of leadership experience, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months as a training staff member at Hearts.
He then helped club Alloa recover after downgrading to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from downgrading, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he is feeling better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of taking over the management of the Alloa club.
“I really thought that the role of the manager was more appropriate for me than the role of the player.
Maybe it sounds strange, because we had a good time, we were winning well and we had some successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel that it is the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that suits me best in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey.
The heatwave this summer has led to higher revenues in pubs across the UK, while putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the representative of CGA’s business consulting firm who conducted the survey, said: “Consistent warmth and England’s participation in the World Cup over a longer period of time contributed to a pattern in July, similar to the previous month, when pubs had up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a longer period.
The number of customers lower by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell even more in July.
Pubs and bars that only serve drinks have posted a much higher profit than restaurants.
And food-service pubs have experienced heat losses, but not as large as those in restaurants.
It seems that people went out in the city only to consume drinks.
Sales of beverages across all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food declined by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative for the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sports and social events remain among the most important contributing factors to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to experience losses, although the 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food business operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some up to 11 years old, has a secret account on a social networking site that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta accounts”
The news has raised fears about sexual posts.
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that they show their parents
One in five children, some up to 11 years old, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to Instagram’s photo-sharing platform.
The news has increased fears about sexual posts.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, noticed a teenager posting asking to be “raped.”
According to research conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness company and the HMC (Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ on the Scottish Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the position of director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletes’ Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those making decisions regarding the sport to take advantage of the vast experience it has acquired internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, the UK, as well as around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle added: “I am delighted to be able to represent athletes and I hope to make a real contribution and help the way sporting activities are conducted in Scotland.”
The American athlete, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to four gold medals at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, has remained disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has caused public opinion to split online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that is meant to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer tech company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cow hay to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't hooves, they're my breasts."
The refrain goes on: "I pump, I pump, I breastfeed, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls."
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of whom said it exposed the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen just a few days after birth.”

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is, both for the mother and for the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "It's an extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Others defended the ad, with one person saying it looked like a "hilarious" ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like ‘vaches’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with the discreet pumps inserted into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even go out in the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pumped up on the front page.
During the fashion designer Marta Jakubowski’s presentation at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in sponsorship.
Typically, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear they will jeopardize their stay in the country if they ask to pick up children.
The risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data would be disclosed to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
“About 80% of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsors’ family live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals,” Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children in the system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days as the previous standard provided, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempted escape, according to shelter employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating a child has problems are not noticed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting prime minister, said foreign military forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria, there are about 2,000 U.S. military troops, which are mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "several Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which led the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have sought the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are being brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the latest group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avert a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have ties to the al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's activities should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning about interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
If we were to take this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment procedure or scandals would end his term as president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would be, without a doubt, “the most dramatic end to a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News was watched by an average of 2.4 million people in the first half of the year, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had a record audience of 3.5 million people watching it on the nights of major news.
“This is a subject that attracts the public, because we can’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s “Reserve President,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, whether immigrant families can be integrated and the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you're not just an informed citizen of Washington when you get to the sixth hour of viewing the debate by an expert panel on how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidential) sources for his book, "Fear", about the ostrich leather jacket worth $15,000.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"A lot of what it does gives you the feeling that you're watching a reality show and it feeds you with topics every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show "The Ass of the Bond" about the constantly changing distribution and the daily situational upheavals caused by Trump.
You can’t afford to miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’re behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the northern shore of Kauai, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He could not stand out from the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate's legal committee and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
“I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, resulting in two mandate holders running for the same office, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
The new suburb of Pittsburgh put Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb in the race, who won the special election in another district last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th constituency, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th New Electoral District triggered a competition in campaign funding between the major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special, top-rated election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
For more than a decade, the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its deal with China, but then gave up.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any more,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and crime in it.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, administration officials had made it clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
It is now planned that Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three US ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the U.S. election.
Should Congress change, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to stand before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which also applies to his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make and that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested the secret recording of the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performances.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we would get a good result and we won one point.
We probably could have scored at the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we noticed better in the second.
Thursday will again be an important night for Europe.
With a bit of luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having the support of the supporters, surely we will feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training goes well, too.
Let’s hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what happened last season and that we will have good results.”
Women suffer from insomnia because of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with the care you need unless you make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in costing.
Involve your financial adviser: and the financial adviser can be of real help in terms of paying for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: come to meet legal issues.
Obtain medical decision empowerment to appoint a trustworthy person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate them.
Also, consider performing an empowerment on your financial resources.
Choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Do not forget the small details: imagine that an elderly parent of yours has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not all about the financial side. Can you tell us who the doctors are dealing with it?” asked Martin.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write a plan for all of these things.”
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night in the city.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as "random shooting".
The victim could not see the attacker.
The injuries suffered do not endanger his life, and police have called on witnesses to give statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Palu city on Friday, according to authorities, and deaths are expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in northern Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency stretching over a coastline of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region that lies at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fish farming and agriculture are central to the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami hit the western side of Donggala Regency, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 on the Richter scale occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in Aceh’s Pidie Jaya Regency, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed a large number of people.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Several strong earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Allegations of Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit pending trial and is being held on a $500 bail bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "100 percent innocent" when asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of A-crimes, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of this.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence crime complaint and possessing a gun while drunk in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend’s statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffered after serving in the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred off the central province of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on social networks.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
U.S. Attorney Wants Death Penalty for Suspect in New York City Terror Attack
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in New York wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily injuries, according to the death penalty notice filed in New York’s Southern District.
Both counts can receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s execution as “odious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a death penalty case in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York City came in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was happy with what he did, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
Also, according to police, he asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's ex officio defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the death penalty decision, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked the prosecution not to apply the death penalty.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of Theresa May's parliament suggesting he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, told a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK “would have come out” by now if Farage had been secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge facing May in terms of the highly divided camps has been accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest against leaving the European Union in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, runs properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, as well as from the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its offer and “chaos.”
Bone told the event of the pro-Brexit “Leave Means Leave” movement in Solihull that he wanted to “give up the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were run by him, we weren't in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the Wellingborough constituency representative, added: "I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied the suggestions about changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: “It’s not at all true that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party who supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither do our activists who go out in the streets and support us, in the first place, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers who keep their office are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to "feel the pressure" if they are about to give up the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them do that.”
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civil army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party member, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a farce.
Brexit has no benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican House member Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with eligible citizens using the city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that “the time has come for women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government, and this includes having a woman at the helm.”
A suspect has been arrested in the death case that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the death case that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, was 10 times in the starting batch last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 wins per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the back of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped a lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back row of the grid and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, just on his 21st birthday.
Then he was in the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Eventually, he stopped at boxing on lap 44, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me get ahead.
And the team has done an excellent job to get the victory over Ferrari and to achieve this double,” Hamilton said.
Awful body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally over her insistence that she did not facilitate the “leakage” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "bad, immoral and liars."
“The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see that they’ve published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When I asked Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the “leak” of the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leak" occurred from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations concerning Ford and it was not I who facilitated the 'leakage' of her report," Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well with the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was awful body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using the charges to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take power in every possible way.
Observe the evil, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 over Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's Elite League loss, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's 5-3 return game in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with shots taken by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer returned the Giants to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League loss this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by beating Dundee 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance was triggered in the fourth minute, or 3:35, of a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into play at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the chance to score for a draw at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first half, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard tied again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team climbed to 5th place in the standings around the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died after ensuring the takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake shook Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong aftershocks in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Palu’s heavily shaken Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained at the scene to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter has to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe the number will increase as many victims are still under ruins and we have not had access to many of them,” agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters high ravaged the city of Palu, with a joint funeral scheduled for Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings in casualties.
It is almost impossible to find safe drinking water.
All the mini-markets are being robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the ground.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Now Says One Person Is Missing After Plane Crashed Into Lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia has now said one person is missing, having previously said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger had been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane missed the runway and landed in a lagoon near it.
Some witnesses believe that the plane crossed the end of the runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Naval Forces said sailors working nearby to renovate a pier jumped to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
Analyst Reveals Chronology of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended its plea for the resumption of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone footage to piece together the actions of Quinton Tellis, 29, as well as those of his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness stand and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final pleading on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop music trio wants to change the negative way this genre of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that hip-hop has stopped delivering political messages and tackling social issues as it originally did.
They want to go back to the roots and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the UK has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after accidentally receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “still a black person.”
The couple denied being racist, saying she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day at work in 2016.
“NUUUUUU! ANOTHER PERSON OF COLOUR,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, stating that the nanny, who is African-American, had not performed her duties properly and had expected to receive a nanny of Philippine nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and demands $350 a day for six months, the period during which she had to live with them and conduct her business, despite the fact that this was done without a signed contract.
“I want to show them that such things are not being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied claims that they were racists, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post newspaper.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you wronged, even if it was by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Calling the trial an "extortion" action, Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
It’s not like that,” the banker added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Editors of Paddington’s story fear readers won’t be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said the following things about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very funny now, having seen that Paddington was a huge success.”
She said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, was optimistic about rejecting her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a "sweet-yellow" one after she died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she later enjoyed.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who was successful: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your success.
I think that’s how he saw Paddington’s success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to credit Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad calls frequently to tell me it’s very serious and he doesn’t think he’ll survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, “Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to diminish and come out of her body.
It had died a short time ago and the organs were starting to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I knew he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a catchy smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood.”
However, he quit work before he died, because he had come to a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking it's going to have a domino effect on you."
She created the messages “to tell people that they can appeal to someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out there, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's longtime friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old life partner, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day when the children unwrapped their presents and didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “It caused immense pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for – a limited-time and small-scale investigation – we could have a little unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate” amid a partisan blockade.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the Nov. 6 election — if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want as the winner in the country’s highest court election will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has repeatedly appealed to senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make a difference in the case of a tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean Fugitives Decline Under Kim’s Leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by those illegally transporting people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A vast majority of North Korean fugitives are finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers the fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks on the subject of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions of causing a lack of progress since then.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, under no circumstances will we be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", declaring that he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
“I can’t help but think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination,” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony showed he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he showed bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, how wonderful!’”
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and he cannot speak without breaking out in tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued, “I got significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
It seemed like a brilliant thing.”
Tears are allowed to bring out anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying because of an inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the back of the head by an older woman, a cold director who I always felt a little afraid of, and took me down the stairs.
“He should never see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they caused you that feeling.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she says, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was coming to an end, she was behind with the fundraiser and swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a losing fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were giving her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting cuts?” she asked.
During her speech announcing that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of her gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration of the system, and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that she lost her voice.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the media’s reaction to her.
"You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my gravestone.
"Did she cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China benefit Beijing?
The bailouts announcing the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and while there still seems to be a long way to go, quarrels between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week came with new taxes affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively applying taxes on half of all goods in China that arrive in the United States.
Beijing has taken revenge every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly ceding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. pressure on the trade war could support China positively in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would, in fact, be more dangerous than previously anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert group.
Syria Ready for Refugee Return, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country ravaged by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to the top spot after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has put incredible effort into much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot into the water to hair 3 at hole 16, giving up the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari had an incredible performance in all half-time, becoming one of four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament existed in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost in holes 5 and 4 to the last-place player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost in holes 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most victorious player in Europe, averaging 25.5 points in his entire career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s teamwork and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said, emotionally, after the European victory.
He handed over the relay to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team put in a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played tremendously throughout the entire tournament.
Team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they really worked hard.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
We've been in a bitter fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
These 12 boys are dear to me and I am proud to be their captain.
We have to give them the proper respect.
They played better than us.”
