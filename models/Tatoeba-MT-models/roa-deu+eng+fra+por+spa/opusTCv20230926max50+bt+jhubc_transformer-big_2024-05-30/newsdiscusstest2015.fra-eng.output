UKIP residents who refuse to accept those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue up behind chronic hypochondriacs who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who uses specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing insane, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
Neither do you know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase has surprised many, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to be able to get over it.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have solved anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ‘Tigre of Europe’, was boasting to us a few years ago.
We knew the sequel!
This begins to read the article again.
We are trying to pretend that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is nothing to ''flavor'' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the eighties of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is sure in the light of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the politicians on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily bottlenecks since the start of the school year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will catch fire soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a crash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it won’t be on one of those two once it’s refashioned.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers a surcharge for the additional fear they were given?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I flew it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can take it to heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare just have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a nice trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, Rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and is literally crowded.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% of tourists.
<0x40>False Aloes!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy at a duty-free rate.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There is still the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, makes it possible to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister responsible for the economy nor the minister responsible for foreign affairs have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they shut it down.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not we!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life which he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some aren't terrible.
Probably his estate would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he won very skilfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, ultimately, of the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: mistrust of dialogue
Return to princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarily we come to his aid, or, he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between the one who invests for a return at the time of retirement and the one who lives from his rents.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above, it is vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but in an era of shortage of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way could a new deal be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth emerges in response to a recession that is only wild degrowth and therefore brutal.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is crying: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A taxation that favours high incomes and rentiers.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung’s profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they can not be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there a "better car maker", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us about which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and indicate us the works they intend to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart, cultured person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and <0x40> give us some answers.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second in calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their homes.
We are no longer in the debate of ideas.
This is something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for a discussion of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the mere exposition of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud really enclosed the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey hold Labor accountable.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return it to its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so of course I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with Perseid meteor showers and for virtually every major astronomical phenomenon in recent years.
I am beginning to think that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds over Melbourne’s suburbs.
I'm going to put a TAX on this eclipse.
Anyone watching this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last thought before you go to bed.
Who or what will you do when it comes down to it?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse THEM of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth.
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital incomes.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that we can form an opinion.
Today, Tuesday, October 15, you will see the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest level in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
However, these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What happens if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have achieved the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack on the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
<0x40>lol No the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
Moreover, unless public spending is considered unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that will guarantee future growth and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Because the Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should learn how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrongly worded to blame doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and "research."
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is over-the-counter or prescription-only.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for cancer pain, despite the laws that curb them and the expensive permits required.
While manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who come up with a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of an official of this hospital.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, we might be using their “work.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy, not research.
We cannot say “the research is done, we must apply it” and then in the same jet “we must experiment at all costs”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator let's make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a willingness to self-promote, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training, and that practitioners teach practitioners.
Fabrice, re-read the paragraph on internships (which alas is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in a modern training of teachers.
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating theatre before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally crappy: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would like even less to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of combating copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> theft.
It is the same since they have to cite their sources correctly.
Getting a license often costs nothing.
No, it's copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without a proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can still debate pedantic hypotheses - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Come on, say it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement
Apparently you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in schoolwork, an almost perfect definition of what should constitute reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson <0x23>1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share their mp3 player headphones with a buddy on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we abound in, the whiner who says that everything is wrong....
If it is a member of the PS who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are the speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have been working in a private company ever since.
I had the CHANCE to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the dummy bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What are French bosses waiting to do the same??
That the state holds their hand?
This state they're accusing of impeachment?
<0x40> Jacques L.
Always this anti-businessman couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40> Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France faces an insoluble problem: the incompetence of the French business leaders unable to create jobs and who thrive and undermine while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
It's awful!
But they have solutions: suppression of the Labour Code, employers’ charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I'm from, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this.
I've tried to get them recently, but I haven't succeeded.
But Labour is going to get us out of trouble, isn't it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing stopping people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally overturned.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on the right track while the management of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a fighting girl.”
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that the fact of being "beating" is a superior quality to many others, the concern for others, the intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with the fact of surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", who are no less dead, I know some levers.
Getting out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll start again too.
I'm not telling you that this is the condition to manage, I'm telling you that it helps..
Nothing to do with any merit.
When it comes to the examples of your life, it’s up to you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one can have merit in coming out of a disease or that one can demerit in not coming out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, but having a solid morality probably makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to rely on the "lord" it's something else.
Neither with the merit nor with the courage.
These considerations are peculiar to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real dirt, you get stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, fat ones, and if I "fighted" as these psychologist ends say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is all about gritting your teeth, suffering hell, and taking the blows.
I thought the indictment against Milosevic was decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
Hey, what's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who triggered three Balkan wars in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under THE LOWEST rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed that same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by Western states that then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
As far as I know, only in Greece does one method of predicting earthquakes work, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules,” according to a study conducted by the University of Maryland’s Jonathan De Framing team.
Method to follow, then.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for often delighting us with these experimental prowess that are being realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless to man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we do not have reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that dealt with the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me.
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we run into the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don’t understand why we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to amuse you with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of crap, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because he's a celebrity and people have been taught to worship celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have truly and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “strait of scrap” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must still be there from the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed by the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumption to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
One more com operation is neither done nor to be done.
Cows are too much to eat!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your story makes me revisit, identifying myself a bit in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us review, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

I think that the red hat that has demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as those!
Are there any players in the current Serbian line-up who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in Velez's big team which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished second twice in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes such as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsène Primonger's loyal teammate, Bororac Wenger).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he would become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn *shiver*
Now I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he is not a starter.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of pre-1913 Albania, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How can we have felt “an explosion of joy” when we see two towers collapse knowing that women, men and doubtless children are inside?
How ???
What annoys me a little in this "testimony" is that the mere fact of having been able, even once, to rejoice spontaneously in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a "border line" personality whose all "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost circumspection.
No doubt in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One may have thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in doing real and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
The Schadenfreude classic.
We suspected it a little.
The "Christian/White/Gaulish" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can we get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, we must not turn back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don’t be your cranky cliche!
Not all of them.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs from the outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowfall and many other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of surcharges for children, it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10.
However , as regards the number of households whose taxes have increased as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 which are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half the share concerning especially widows is not at all treated in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we are not on the straw, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we will not cry...
It is obvious that those in the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s keep going and you’ll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been surpassed, money serves only to make money, that is, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or rather, lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing .
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge head-cutters have fortunately lived on.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
It's okay.
In one of the two we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or deal with any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep in it, put it behind you and go back.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six hours too late.
I love airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky.” No, it’s not true.
You've just really been out of luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
To his dismay, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he did not receive any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a down payment and a month’s rent at once but I’m a little scared to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” sang the Bu$herie in every tone.
Weapons are harmless.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombings.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're in agreement.
Do you think it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were “worked” for 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And let us not be led to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Besides, it's so much hiding at 5pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with maths, come, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to sneak up on poorly educated people whose parents are spitting on you and calling you a jerk?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurd population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has absolutely screwed up everything.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more a year and they didn't even apply for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
Don’t worry about it if you can’t find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well or that you enjoy doing.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still be paying off my student loan.
I don't like to work in a company so I hope in the long run to be in either the public service or the university.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a backlog of three years.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Get rid of the bisounours courses such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what are called the diplomas of the unemployed.
I got one of those degrees and I finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the above article says, a good professional career, starting at school and throughout the university.
It is true that the starting salary was lower, but we quickly climb the ladders because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic tracks have been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve every problem, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisounours sectors?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you’re talking about degrees like media study or whatever absconse track you’ve been to.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t a real territorial policy be better to decongestion Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I hardly see the inhabitants of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise fare 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner walls and the small belt already have many means of public transport that are much more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They can benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we couldn't find a place for ONE bike hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delano<0xC3><0xAB>....
Well, that's not good at all.
When we talk with pedestrians and other users of public transport <0x3D> verbal), not to talk about the reasons why they do not pedal the roads before and after it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1 / it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that ride super fast and don't care about the survival of the bicycles 2 / we take full of pollution in the head For me, the area is to reduce the type of bicycles.
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must coexist but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% cycling trips is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering begins, it would be better to find out who really hides behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world is changing.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching in the area of aerial attacks against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents in order for airlines to pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurper government/ultranationalists of Western Ukraine – and wanting to demonstrate in bulk that Putin shot down MH17?
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the government of Kiev because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of arms to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott is telling Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, investigators haven't said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such an eco-Biotan is distressing!
Calling yourself Polar is losing the north is cheerful.
The question is: Is the poor man of today poorer than the poor man of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of labour incomes, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today matches that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, one can debate it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue one-sidedly in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press wrong?
I haven’t read it and won’t read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me pure crap.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity become richer?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden to the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working-class neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she were not where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
This is absolutely disgusting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when he was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are enrolled and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may sound contradictory, but perhaps it means that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at age 14.
Quite disappointed by this entry in the matter of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her double character of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The directing is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I'd rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is especially the risks of staging and editing that astonished me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the sanitization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little bit to see you throw the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many more things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her path and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
I watch a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end up like 24 hours.
Everyone does what they want, right?
It’s because I say “I won’t look later” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she will be fatal to him.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - cuts rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to sabotage spending have failed.
Trigger controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for and all the while some in each camp are pretending that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters are seeing clearly in their game and finding them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenses.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines that are pretty much useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you get to a figure that makes the most ludicrous living on the job tax.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay about <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The higher the social contributions, the higher the local taxes, the higher the parking fees and the car sticker, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend that money is falling from the sky, or that it doesn’t matter where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed looking for work from door to door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not search, it means that 80% search and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of the same.
I haven't heard from Pôle Emploi in months, does that mean that the agents are more busy with check-ups than really getting job ads?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Emploi should be dispensed with.
What is a sensitive topic?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed do their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport ticket from users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one screams scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Recording and control is now taking over, while statutorily Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should concern only the employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and non-employed French people grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of wage-earning work.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hajj in Mecca this year for Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa application denied because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during Hajj in the 1980s, probably infected by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was common sense but apparently those “who know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
Nobody's coming out.
Only health care workers can enter.
21 days after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa even though they took “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Prohibit them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
Let him pass the message of the individual first and the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the cortexes of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It's only been 20 years since information appeared as humanity's given premium, while religion, stemming from the cerebellum, has guided our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot on the Church anyway, it is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will allow to touch more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you consider it pre-existed in Christ.
Hillel once said, “Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only commentary: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "advance justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and the resurrection are taken away.
Jesus will remain the hero who upended moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated then forcibly converted and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
It's not invented.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If this is the PC version you are interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll check it out.
Obviously not at work.
The jewels of the IT department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
The PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
I bought it on Steam, so no refunds.
It's time to buy a new video card *goodbye*
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'd delete it from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned region.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France of 1940 a “putrid soil”?
Say, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Do we have to love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature one wonders if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his right value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, keep dating Levy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi to the awful ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing followed me all the way here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the awful Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fans (not to be confused with camera fans).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I reach the age of 95 I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you are moving a bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
It immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have eyes wide closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping one's eyes closed that one has access to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental misunderstanding: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned IS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Whoever does not say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, so be it.
Who does not say consent, but consents to what?
Consents to proximity to ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the election, “take revenge” on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are those threats?
The Conservatives don't give a damn about Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on issues that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists, and she did it well.
Yet he is still vying to be prime minister in 2015 and that since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and all the way to the end.
It's East Germany's "Life of Others" or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's cheerful as a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers that have the intelligence to offer files without mosquitoes.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, I have no regrets.
I am disappointed by the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your consumer bookstore, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are arguably derisory.

The data published by Kobo does not identify readers or authors.
But Kobo does have all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic acid kids.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is unclear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation there or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Reading Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to the c*nnies balanced by the traditional media. The short article you give the link to is important and should be read with realistic observations/previous warnings coming from Iran regarding Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980 in mind.
Who are these “moderate” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines pushes the world to the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “necessary”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP which planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal were killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver was killed by the Bolsheviks in a derelict place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a freak!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain the contact with the real.
There are clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the belly of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a childish desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile hetero couples, too.
As for the children!
It is a shame to call them future psychological imbalances.
One day they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay this lady's retirement (?)
The GPA is undoubtedly a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It does not date from today.
Many women have born and given birth to children that were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are so made...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are not also commodification of bodies?!
Anakronic Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a maid pregnant in a distant country via internet and Pay Pal than to assume its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all roofs!
These practices were not done in the name of the church! ...
It is not only Christians and believers who reject these practices.
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 70s in the Midlands I saw this only from a distance.

But if you liked it and listened to the music – that music still touches you as much as it does today.
I don’t know why there are so many scornful comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article about football that is waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reports that truly reflect the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason understood the social and political context, he understands things well.
Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will be releasing some soul vinyls, including plenty of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a small well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your criticism needs to be more constructive.
Awesome article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series called Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli soldier stole them from him.
The Israeli representative got up in anger and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not let down their guard.
Whether it displeases anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the world geopolitical report ...
And it has always been so since politics is globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it lasts!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What was the balance of power that led to the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Plus, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian’s reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Much of what he says is nothing more than pseudo-chomskyist blunders written by no others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole non-voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he has posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and that it is completely useless to limit the democratic party to two.
I am not saying that I really agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, given that politicians are scoundrels who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is annoying to see all these condescending responses that say that Jesus does not just say to the young people that it is better not to vote.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually says rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and setting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you, sir.
The thing about the vote has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every five years annoys me deeply since my vote really doesn’t count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's remarks are not his own (written by others).
He is clever enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label of "pseudo-chomskyist blunders".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the nods added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to go.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This "sling" reveals to me above all that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDV of History where the historians of trade have become a minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of condensed ready-to-think Sciences Po type for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats who are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe rather that for Foucault the State was indispensable as a culprit.
This is part of a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the relationship to the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to go and seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not state at all in Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
Its thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it cannot stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Neither is support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet presents a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can't stand being disregarded from allegiance to their mantras is pretty laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You have not had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were friendly to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of the whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violent anti-White remarks.
My father isn't happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, Russians are mostly biased against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard Australians' opinions about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two in my life (including one abroad), I haven't kept any bad memories, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London have been very nice that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who we meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left such as the union of the judiciary...
<0x40>Marabout: sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly brand right.
When it comes to the Union of the Judiciary, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it commands to dismiss two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as well as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the mandatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecution, forces a distinction between error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided among these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge do not belong to an objective analysis.
And so if all this is not analyzed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The field considered is that of the plundering* of heirs committed up to the means of frauds to the procedure* by hereditary genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession earns <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million each year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-impunity* of the French notary public.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement moderated by the previous comment, is that the judicial institution has produced, during many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be thus plundered, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Probably prohibitive prices.
Another piece of equipment to scam the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks Epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's dung on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a handicapped with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
However, not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
We can’t really say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, it is not planned to manufacture it.
I'm glad the "long-distance" wheelchair isn't coming to market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation too, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
This is not a wooden tongue, but rather concrete and armed lady...
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market, it is certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The U.S. has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by who knows) excluded him!
Remember also that after having lifted it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down from the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it over.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the not-for-profit sharing economy.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it is getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trustworthy owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What is it renting out?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to practice a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The houseboats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
all these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you gonna dock it?
Marine Le Pen is right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017, the season will be over!
Capitalism will not become impoverished.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food therefore our food, with the structures of care therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild banker as Minister of Economy in order to better defend the interests of the banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else who was competent?
What do you call it? Turning his jacket, lowering his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
I don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was sweltering at the beginning of the day; I do not know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, you see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
“A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, which had vanished into obscurity after the firing had ceased, and a chase-race began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still on the move.
After pointing the spotlight on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was rejected and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they fled to take advantage of their lead.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are raised in the UMP to ask that it be enshrined in the law that an elected permanently convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected members of the left of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A WALL INSCRIPTION OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to tame those who will take advantage of their immovability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is at the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "money for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place their enormous power at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are completely free.
If, currently, the right is frightened by the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a leftist personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not received favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the union of the judiciary, which is of the left, is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
The fact that a minister is so committed to supporting trade unions shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you cite may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
One now wonders whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to imprison and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most fame-hungry moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others later sold a lot of records or left for the West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is a member of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else have participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the lightweight entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests anyway.
Few are those who, after one tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar buffs who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three chords on an elementary-school poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns fairly quickly to racism, because sacralistic ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and kneaded with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to our practices and inspired considerations, like our daily ones.
Except that you recklessly interpret it the other way around.
Or, rather than say that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as it were recalled to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined and circumscribed object to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the void.
That's all.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacredness still lives on.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw to the nettles not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative critique of the disciplines for us to laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in the middle (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "The shamans of prehistory", particularly the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play about it.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, but it would be too gay!
We could have expected that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own peril.
Rather than making fun of those childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away, then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However there is the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it was only to protect its interests in any case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have released the safety because at the time another vehicle (for example, a tow truck) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not judge it good to advance the time of departure (TV bill, advertising, money ...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well done, I agree with that too.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to restart to beat the English who led then...
This is my blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it doesn't matter, I've got a little time to f**k all your shit.
No, I just don't.
There have been tons of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners at risk of death for a distant history of the possibility of one driver winning at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out the safety car it's the FIA.
Shade of size.
In view of the amateur footage, the lack of image allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner waves a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the stewards waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the waving green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissary post just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) turns green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells ads.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that in the end it's just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with news that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When tabloids cough up about Ebola, we all catch the fear” It should be “derail,” not “cough.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are freaking out that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch.
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh. It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this upside-down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without hysteria) so that the government can make us drift when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that, if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for still being of this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning, it must have been awful, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Totally useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of the new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
What do you base your research on, then?
About fantasies?
Do you put fanciful theories and facts on the same level (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the phony word adulated by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D’Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have crafted a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think about Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to pull the Sentinels out of the air...
And why is that?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang out?
The only solution that comes to mind is the piss-caca kind of humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if we do not see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years that we have one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition the half-hour episodes now pass to 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this show every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have allowed nothing to be found.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque esplanade was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, this is Mount Moriah where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and has scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is not.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naiads half naked, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
Too bad the Reuters photographer didn’t take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to quail Jewish worshippers below, praying at the Wall of Lamentation.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is rightly not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of wailing and groaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't mess with people with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held up.
Did you vote for PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that is exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this bill and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage this deal will do to our lives.
The Independent Guardian World Development Movement has only recently begun to talk about it in the media, so look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
That’s great payoff, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth century there were unions in every regiment.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (finally, its officers, the others, nobody knows anything) believe itself to be the vault of France’s eternal values, and it will fight and shut its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even if it is becoming more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, single men, married women, single men, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I'll join the union.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
Protected professions with trade unions have already suffered enough for the defence of category interests, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
Please do not laugh about fear of risk on the part of an employee.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster is assured.
And with the wagons preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises".
This is absolutely indispensable with the irruption of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I watched, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (albeit misleading: it was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, some cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory of the least bad baker; no one has said, “boom, here’s my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master!”
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept aside.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can’t imagine it.
I’m grateful to those who do it and so offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to choose, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make him want, anyway Richard had already lost by that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allotted.
There's also cancer lurking, along with solar winds.
Definitely, everything is succeeding us at the moment.
A bad time for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “hunt” ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they have the benefit of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and lets through UVA and most UVB.
Do you know that you do not have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a remnant when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Without saying that I am used to melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They do not provoke it.
As a proof: not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
Or, when a doctor tells you that you should avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be bent if it is applied enough strength and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has therefore not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be bent if sufficient force is applied to it.
I have a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
We make that joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and it is difficult to see how it could return to it.
Well so far so good, knock on wood. . .
Most likely it is a production unit on which the iOS was not installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know at all how they do these things.
But would they put testing software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
This is an article for Bobo.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrials produce in "industrial" We put forward super u but all the signs and meme the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
Everyone is free to put their priorities where they want to be.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without a grudge, I kiss you
They call bobos, or rather bobo-ecologists, people who see the world through ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
It is the total unbundling of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferia, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferia so do not be surprised to meet often criticisms about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I would love to be a part of it, but I can’t find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
She's so badly made that she vaguely looks like a female nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astounding beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply don’t have any legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic ability.
That's *art*.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you are looking for just that, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still savings: horseback riding activities, the number of Republican Guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty obliges us to say that France is decreasing its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
<0x40>edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That’s exactly what you’re proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have been close to the military thing dare to come here, with eyes in the eyes, to say that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the entire public service and the public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can feel a little loaded!
Well yes, the savings on which everyone agrees that they have to be made, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan to murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Valley of Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself at every closure of posts, maternity wards, hospitals and barracks.
Everyone is for savings, of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not rejoice in the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through his Facebook feed and see that 80% of his friends started their statuses with the phrase “This embarrassing moment”.
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally stumbles upon his ex on the bus on his way to work and realizes only there that his skirt has slipped back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely silly.
Not really, in my opinion the author takes on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and clench his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has truly demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling backwards!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really crap.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at every rally to save the planet.
So, citizens, we decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted to energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the con- tribuble.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not at all concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emission at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity through renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittency.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I am State Doctor of Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact nothing you did not respond to what I said and like all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour greenhouse gases of less effect than the CO2 it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “giant of South Asia”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against some Pakistani players participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today’s opening game was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The race to the low cost launcher is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with too cold helium.
So perhaps we are not in a defect of design, but of implementation...
unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates, who knows.
This is all the more unpleasant as many media outlets re-loop on the only headlines of articles – and as many readers retain only those headlines.
All in all, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly questions the project when it is only a launcher problem.
