Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s schedule then includes an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive the award inside the Committee.
The White House said in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the awards ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is fighting a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kroner (approximately 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate to charities, but he has not yet decided concretely which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Head of Government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to action" for him.
Defender of Nature Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police charged the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site proceedings and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, a spokeswoman for Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years imprisonment.
Waste sorting dumpsters are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting dumpsters at every corner.
What about Brno?
There, you would have to take several minutes before finding the right dumpsters.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this issue.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found for the moment is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't blame me, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
It's lazy.
It makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, I proposed to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is probably that ecology and an alleged aestheticism do not interest the socialists in Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the top hockey league that shames the city across the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to confirm my impression with official statistics after hanging around for a while on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole region of South Moravia.
Paroubek's budget has removed money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the advice of the government, farmers or public servants it may be that there is a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just postponing the problems to later, undermining the terrain," Janota said.
It should be noted that the interest payable on the money borrowed is increasingly high and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If he doesn't cut welfare or his spending, he'll have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and need not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state debt - next year there will be no shortage of $163 billion in coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be a lack of $5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started and for which it is not possible to modify the projects in order to possibly reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the transport ministry.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adroitly - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (supplier and distributor of electricity), which the state owns for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were shipped from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or even to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international proceeding, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, at worst, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a shortfall of $100 million in the two-billion state fund project, which will allow for online tracking of each administration's spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another with the press of a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices by 2012.
Snow scarcity in the mountains worries hoteliers
The deserted slopes are not a problem only for the operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation only comes after that, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler are currently offering only one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try for a while to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas holidays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February start just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be full," Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few places left for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February sells well too," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> central car park is also eighty percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly grow again, said the manager of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should warm up, informs Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It becomes even comic, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with a reputation for wisdom, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he considered himself as simple.
When he ended up letting his long-awaited doctrine perspire, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-torn Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, emanating from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but, objectively speaking, it left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than could be hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he swindled at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems to the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a halving increase will bear the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing more than the eye-powder behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity on the relationship, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a "prompt-to-act state", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes him bewildered by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a solution of the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only ruse for Obama is the fact that he has three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it in response to strong criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
The shares may be withdrawn from the executives in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link earnings with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain said Wednesday it plans to allocate a single 50 percent tax on bankers' bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, have today received in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with fellow Americans Jack Szostak, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the diploma, Nobel Medal and Certificate of Acquisition of the Monetary Award.
It reaches 10 million SEK in each category (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million).
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and possibly Janota's position in the firm will be on the agenda for their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Oshvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Representatives on Wednesday validated the proposals of the left regarding money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the savings package passed by the Fischer government, which according to him must stem the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not require it, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrepressible deficiency" of public finances.
There is now, in his view, no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and the government should question its future existence.
SDG Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the SDG and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts."
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD leader Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in new Clint Eastwood movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincible will expose to the world a lot about the country, its fights and victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman portrays the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The 72-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Million Dollar Baby set in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of an anti-slavery movement turned slave himself, a fictional U.S. president, or even God in the film Evan Almighty is so important to anyone yet.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country is still and still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders at the global level.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other goal but to play that role in a way that brought it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover from your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby's tough environment.
For him, his first encounter with Pienaar at home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened it to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the film.’
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film ratings on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only acknowledged yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava"-type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian military is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or she damaged herself in mid-flight.
Russian Newspapers Talk About "Bulava" As "The Missile That Doesn't Fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial was going on normally in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was obviously the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely set on fire from a moving vessel and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak of failure at all.
The first two stages of the rocket withstood and the damage only hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always affirm that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will probably make his entry already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who ended his career at forty in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will involve only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetisov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also earned tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k confirmed this.
The management, however, wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, which is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroner to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be assigned to postteriori for the working day on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can post a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays of end of year indicated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions as well as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two overtime hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the factory management and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the state of strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged harassment.
The management defended itself with the fact that the employees had to work extra to meet the imperatives in the production of automobiles.
In announcing the strike on Monday, unions also demanded that workers who ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions are calling on society to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (209 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>) for these.
The Hyundai car plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles as of September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Works on ‘Endurant’ HIV Viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the upper hand over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS right now.
However, the life of patients can be radically prolonged through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding to virus proteins.
The metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
Dispute over budget. SDGs attack Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the budget ratified for the following year "scary" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call its existence into question.
The Prime Minister called the SDG statement a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
SDG spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the SDG and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, which is concerned with tackling the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with however the proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House has increased funding for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to run a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The SDG left the room before the vote, obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his time in government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-enhancing legislation such as health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the SDG are not in question.
This is the business of the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDGs have done nothing detrimental, Topolánek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to the journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew out in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDG has reversed at the request of the Prime Minister.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question of whether the SDG had not been criticized by the Party president in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missed.
I already knew at the time I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevism of the House and a destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some less-charged express or regional trains and will instead reinforce some others.
Total transport coverage will be reduced by two per cent on the day the new schedules come into force.
Most rates will not change, including base rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by eight per cent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which is made possible by the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main railway station (Praha Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion kroner to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in the amount of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net one-day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route traveled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a few elementary school students and their teachers.
AFP reported, but originally only spoke of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 rebels are reported to have used the hostages as human shields during a police flight.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines following a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrate part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has high hopes because it is being presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase of racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the ruling black majority.
According to AP, the reactions to the new film are for the time being quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pave" .
Morgan Freeman, in his own words, is proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela several times in person to be able to – as they say – recover from his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African defender of human rights during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to collect two racial groups of a long divided population and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters wearing the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had then won.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago by mostly white audiences and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain, recently confided in an interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of kroner in flames in the region of Louny
A fire in the morning engulfed a processor of the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company from the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>stí fire department, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn out, but they reviewed their opinion and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokeswoman of the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything similar and incidents of this type are isolated.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, says the spokeswoman of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company for Northern Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of the fireplaces, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission assemblies and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission units to distribution units and lines with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file defamation lawsuit against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of the Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint today against three social democratic prefects.
And concretely against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martinka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura indicated it in Dvacet minute of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
The three of them attacked us and said that we were making the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the Czech Railways prices that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slandering the Student Agency, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media show which serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who is manipulating public opinion and using false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable steps taken by the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broader sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay for vaccines.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal infections.
However, the parents paid 1,600 kroner or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroner on vaccine doses.
They do, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
Until now, the state spent about 500,000 kroner per year on the entire vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions regarding a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
As of January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said that a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we were able to impose at least this.
I think that's a direction that we need to take now," said Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, recognizes that a vaccination based on volunteering its defects.
"In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This, however, is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the amounts from health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a renowned illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour is calling for an increase in the budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also drew lightning by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% cap rate on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
Trade unions have protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" are looming.
The decline in Social Insurance - which will get about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the business world, because according to him, it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would start growing again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence how much it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy is likely to fall by 4.75% this year – far worse than the 3.5 percent decline predicted in April – while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis," said plans to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years were not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to reimburse, they added, “cynically” evading difficult choices until after the elections – which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
Important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from upcoming cuts, contrary to the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised from the tax hikes and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on the wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the timing of the announcements - such as the inflation increase for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor’s figures imply, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defense.
"The pain is actually just postponed," said its director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins,” said Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte’s Accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates ‘Arrests of Americans in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States should “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuse'
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever before, according to Amnesty International’s report.
The report presents "repeat violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked up in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary should set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an effort to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small springboard preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the runway was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the city lights glistening below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After the party on Thursday night, the snow will be abandoned to melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.

Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their Sunni purist Islamist counterparts associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be reached with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite who are so virulent guardians of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it up is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
An expert on the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers proving their worth in hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspirant who had only the tip of his musketeer to fight, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the area needed for an adult in the wild; the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore turned green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorskiers use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will stay the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric nor oceanographers can accurately report the rate of change.
It's not a failure to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first insights into the melting of the ice sheet.
Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in relief beneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the nets of frozen brackish water.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines among 6,000 people who laid wreaths on graves in Arlington
First-class De’Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who once stood in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I’d like someone to do the same for me, which is why I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the annual trip, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Coated in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating back to the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, because these are not as often visited as the new tombs, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine wreaths over the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others dangled to see the small black and white information cards, shoved into the wet earth for those whose tomb had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears at her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are...my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. national arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Foreign Ministry said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can repay it.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- distributing mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting down a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of the Pakistan Tribal Belt, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA's plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that have become a refuge from terrorism.
They were seen as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to gain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has had the priority of infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups also need to pay more and more attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model that so many other people have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for 'climate action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event went relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists ignited some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, displaying signs in English saying ‘There is no planet B’ and one in Spanish declaring ‘Earth says it has had enough’.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country of Peru opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already occurring.
That’s one of the reasons I decided to join the big march — to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothes lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the Palace of Congresses, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that the march may seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they are disrupting negotiations or harming the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal stubborn differences between breeds
Last week’s federal report on math outcomes brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind the leading establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains steady, dropping only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of the blanks was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently large.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only narrowed to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we raised the bar by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and inconvenient, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a not-for-profit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I’m not jumping for joy for one or two points earned,” said Kwame R. Brown, a D.C. council member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s frightening is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren at the end of elementary school and beginning of high school who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the math program, for kindergarten (kindergarten) to grade 6 (6th grade) classes, focuses on games and real-life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for NAEP progress reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions for those students who are lower in class," Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to close the gap.
It’s a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Therefore, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, can be assured that their children will be able to get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the keys to closing the achievement gap was the length of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
This is where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide was directing them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said thinkingly, when she was told of the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents as teenagers, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five second-generation Hispanics are still in high school -- a remarkable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, and paves the way for future generations to play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela’s universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through their high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry secures deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in rehabilitating Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies went away with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an internet news site.
It will be a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw, have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided technical advice, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid more on contracts than other companies and left with significant stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies shortlisted for auction made bids that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's main organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of the Pakistani civil intelligence service said, speaking on Miran Shah’s phone.
Officials said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two U.S. counter-terrorism officials gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies to attack the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second US official said Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure in al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Khalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has slowed since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have made progress in decreasing their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants.
U.N. special envoy in Kabul withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would resign in March, at the end of a tumultuous term tainted with allegations of widespread corruption during U.N.-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. schedule for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply honor his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a gap of two months between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but said Galbraith's accusations -- which he was thanked for -- "had harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism regarding the international observation of the elections."
Eide said he had proposed appointing a civilian representative to coordinate U.S. relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy UN hiring regulations hindered his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Speaking in front of a bed of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome."
One of the things that weighs on me most is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has reported that some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment solely for peaceful purposes.
At the Geneva talks on October 1, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agree to abandon a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have distanced itself from attempts at a deal - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran’s stiffness in the face of some of the international community’s proposals for which they actually agreed in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in on what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki before flying to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. U.S. authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy in a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters sermoning them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "Another baby is another grave."
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the inadequate birth rate of their city and the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We don’t have a second left, said Wang, a 31-year-old human resources director with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in wealthy coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labour in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is unquestionably the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government to date.
Couples who violate this policy risk huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police a duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced the abuses in implementing this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the one child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip flyers under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those wishing to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted an only child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone taking care of us."
We don’t usually take care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old owner of a translation company, says it most starkly.
For couples working in pairs, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from their parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for emission reductions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back in the spotlight on Friday, due to the release of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas cuts over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations leveraging most of the upcoming time in the charge.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as illuminating the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in time-constrained negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change Yvo de Boer described as “the full picture.”
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also restarted negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative to the Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring greenhouse gas reductions by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if these were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the US chief negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are struggling to find out who should bear the costs of decreasing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold big emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also a Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say negotiations will at the very least lead to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the small island states’ action has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and are calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the pending issues before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be investigated in the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- in which 13,000 people come and go from the Palais des congrès every day -- guitar-playing activists present night shows mocking countries that they believe betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than in emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
“We are entering the courtyard of greats,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will link the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Lost small holes will become thriving suburban cities, business trips will be much shorter, and airplane and car-to-train travel will reduce national carbon emissions while decreasing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of danger to the environment are likely to slow British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to get a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the map will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also planned that HS2 will present three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
Preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go as far as the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like it’s going to be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When this is finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project needs to be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to ride off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage from aircraft to trains, constituting a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading member of Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his riding home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “maintained,” increased his <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a check on members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Emoluments Office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the GBP 271,406 loan from his London property to the home of his riding that he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest publication by the authorities of the Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his job as head of the shadow cabinet in September after an undercover reporter allegedly filmed him saying members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "of the m...e"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil trader, began having to explain his spending in May after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fee office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>4 hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn, to protest after it was revealed he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase last night, Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the Fees Office and then by Legg."
He added: “There is no problem with stealing or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t have been clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, has invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1, as visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm, every day, with patés and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we wait for people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the church should get closer to the people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea for the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends during a dinner party.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, some 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching by Friday a deal that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make “the political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
The riot police immediately intervened relentlessly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groupuscules that had excelled at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the streets Saturday night "handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
The party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has drawn closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces 'farce'
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before closing, according to officials from the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,” said its spokeswoman, Manana Manzgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential elections in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Vast signs showing Bagapsh alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the course of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding to Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The party of Parliament, the procession, generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, all dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened relentlessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groupuscules that had exemplified themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a paved road and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have an eye on the extremist groupuscules, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, as the helicopters of law enforcement turned in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam mobilized several prominent figures, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas bragging about solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held calling for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The history-geo comes out reinforced of the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography came out "strengthened" of the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in science terminal.
From now on, elementary students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, noting again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of history-geography in terminal in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory history-geography education in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as have the left and some elected right-wing.
The minister added, however, that there was "no question" of deleting the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will focus on their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also take internships in situation during the year of M2 then will be a first year in front of the students as intern teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, that is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the stakes of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that faced Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of 15-minute expert interventions, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school pond.
We choose about twenty speakers from among the experts of their discipline and we select them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk about the hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos taken from these lectures will be posted on the school’s website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others on a bimonthly basis.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prison overseers' unions on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prisons and to "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but they assure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing them that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not recur in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meager, except for management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, indignant the interregional union FO Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, believes the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less well off than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He's Offering 'Greater Stuff' Than He Gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas in the White House, told small-screen pope Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule about gifts: "I give nicer things than I get."
As part of a special show that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse into how they intend to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, noting that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama misrepresented her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before replying with humor by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour, relaxed-atmosphere show, with the celebrated hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to arrange a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's in Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL says the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc herniation he suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, adding that these injuries had "needed a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself by saying that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the arts.
He was unavailable Thursday night to comment on RTL’s information.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said he did not "worry" about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because 12 hours of flying after such an operation isn’t playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "contained".
Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had undergone surgery for "little colon cancer" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been heavily commented on, with fans and journalists noticing the singer’s difficulties in getting onstage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: the first of Bousquet on his fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in the big pool, won an international title on Thursday on a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where suits are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken while waiting for a breakout.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay men 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking at the world record of the 50 m freestyle, whose mark he holds in the big pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet overtook Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he envisioned.
We can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
Originally 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of the suits did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400 m freestyle mark (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by scoring the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t really get into this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola auctioned $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to the French writer Emile Zola was auctioned Thursday for $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auction of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, said a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The sign remained for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bath in her Parisian mansion, and in Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There was a shadow of about 50 years old.
In searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's abortive departure attempt from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico said Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe haven by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr Zelaya, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a safe haven.
But the ousted president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a guest acting head of state.
The putschist government "had a new failure in wanting me to resign from my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing some chords.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, the interior minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
“I am not asking for asylum from any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which has its headquarters in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced its headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he is released, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" of which the justice accuses him, according to the putschist government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up higher on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing the recovery in activity from both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones rose 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq by 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, estimating that the market was focused on "half-full glass".
Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, said investors focused on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the deficit to rise.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of the major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, new jobless enrollments in the United States rose unexpectedly last week to 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of pro-government supporters conspire against 'Ladies in White'
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired on Thursday with the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspired in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP found.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by officers in civilian clothes who came to “ensure their protection”.
The day before, a similar demonstration took place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by police in plain clothes, an AFP journalist said.
The police forced dissidents into civilian vehicles that were conspired by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lock and key.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” on the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rare, Cuban television reported Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A forceful kills an octogenarian with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A forceful armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour's drive, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the assailant, 28 years old, allegedly struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy of 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses said.
Seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, stepped in and was injured.
The first two victims, who were seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The lives of the other wounded are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then suffered a discomfort and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He reportedly wounded two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he carried in a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, have tried to control the man.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was tough, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passengers came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very large wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s arrived, wounded with a knife.
It was the National Police that arrested the man without identity papers.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre has referred the investigation to the departmental judicial police service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The victim was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source has not ruled out that he will be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the stalwarts of this species whose forces are multiplied by the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again demands the abandonment of the prosecution
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the lawsuits against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years of morals.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of The Pianist, denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the incident in 1977 before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, Hummel said, adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before handing down his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved imprisonment -- which constitutes a serious procedural misconduct.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells had finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the lawsuit, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor from the court, while disregarding its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the discontinuance of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer stand to be harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his Gstaad cottage, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery," summarized Charles Schwab analysts.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also picked up sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the month before, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were slowed by a further rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushed down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of traveling through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to cross Saturday the last straight line to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass held for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already secured their ticket to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
“I’ve seen so many things and had so many experiences,” says Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I’m happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have as last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dated people I never thought I'd be able to get close to.
I will undoubtedly return for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to his son David.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assured Friday his son David upon his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles where he was supposed to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he left the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's relaxed-looking son said he was going "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade attends school, to attend a school show, an AFP photographer found.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he will visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible legal process to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "departed far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, given that I had two disc hernias myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "departed without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a bruise following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by justice, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
The doctor said the procedure went "perfectly well" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be in parenthesis.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and adds the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the bid attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardi party, warning him not to use it on any support, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, summoning them not to use the acronym anymore and to pass on the property of the brand, under penalty of legal prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you will propose to your political movement to take back the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to send on your militant material and on the watch page of your site, the name of this movement, the "New center", the slogan "the UDF of today", also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which urges the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) mark to its legitimate successors".
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they point out that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He exploits scandalously and fraudulently the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine if, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to spoliate a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his pictures of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case about one of France’s richest families, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L’Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010 saying in particular if Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she will submit to it.
I'll talk to him about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news ... The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was due to examine the admissibility of Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
"Françoise, I have never been able to talk to her since her wedding."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again found that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant her request to open a procedure for judicial protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said public prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court ultimately decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees reminds the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of getting employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as it used to be, of imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the business, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can result in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emergent part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular R&D and, even more so, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "demands from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put the employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
The Relative Usefulness of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Firstly, because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally manages, after many detours, to do as a priority... what it has always done.!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent investigation by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalistic vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilizing factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resources management “in place”.
In this way, they create a basis for the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: ‘Just War’ Worth Right-Wing Praise to Obama
The US right-wing welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of a "just war" against US enemies.
The Conservatives, who mocked Mr. Obama’s award on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
“I liked what he said,” Palin, a right-wing Republican, told USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped there, she said.
Obama, who inherited from his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives congratulated, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remarks.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historical, said Mr. Gingrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former president, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to see "a leftist president" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush reconverted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama gave "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "tender, blistered and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When you wrap war around the notion of justice, you can easily justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained praiseworthy of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama "produced the right speech," the New York Times said, deeming it "both dark and uplifting."
Roadrunners: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" with this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early on Friday, hoping to sign the agreement text quickly by the end of the morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it still took more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to business" and "there was a concern that it would disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're starting from very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give the order to our militants that there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and of 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the general maintenance of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employers' expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill of finance rectification for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies belonging to this organization, and secondly, to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dumb market" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, deplored Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban transit line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the second day of a strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium claim.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A traverse d'ouest is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at rush hour, and almost no oars at off-peak hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no clash on the docks, the Franciliens having organized themselves.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "one hour and thirty minutes earlier, to make sure he was on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience any saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and law enforcement agencies.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to reach the metro.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "lean" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a bonus due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in brackets, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not screwed to solve a problem while in the roadmen and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions for exercising the profession," the RATP said.
This also made unions say that the company "laughed at the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a setup committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had previously refused any discussion during the strike, suggested "in an effort to appease" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen to the RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to the daily million travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for shifted schedules, on Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, Consequential Decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday declared the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "focus of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," court president Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" to the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, to try to quell Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said a breakup could lead to increased tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement forces fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, as protesters threw Molotov cocktails or rocks with slingshots.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court's decision would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service (FES) says that it is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the astrologers, it could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high-traffic streets, main thoroughfares, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
ESF officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road melt that adheres well, in 3 hours maximum time.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service tells us "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it does not snow anymore, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows well that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot team sets off to clear out areas deemed dangerous and crossings.
As far as cycling paths are concerned, EDF services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt which monitored the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
There are also times when the police call on this special service for snacks in need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the lands emerging from the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship ties, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists, at the site of Gohst Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team recounts that they sometimes found a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Triassic.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have uncovered the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
Researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn doesn't think this discovery is particularly spectacular, but he says it confirms some theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the earliest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the later emerged tyrannosaur and velociraptor and from which birds descend, the sauropods, quadrupeds at the long neck, and those related to them and the herbivores such as the ornithistoschial species that are part of them.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa was one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that the Tawa hallae possessed small air sacs in its bones at the level of the skull, just like birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed air sacs and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the lands that formed the Pangean supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor that migrated, the researchers said.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a palaeontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaur, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a misconception because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while practically none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread across the planet, fostering the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the flowering of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time was vegetating in the shadows: it was mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino of J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America, express their solidarity with the protest students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemned the police intervention demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler had buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike evacuated after walls and works of art were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and attempts to make the reasons for the mobilization forgotten.
The steering committee of the University thus avoided the debates which would nevertheless be indispensable.
The judges demanded that the criminal prosecution be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradations.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Verdi regional youth secretary Alexander Klein.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took part in the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the site is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU member of the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition SPD parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and demands, we evacuate them.
The Left party has tabled a motion that summons the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new Silicon-Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret armaments, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the Frankfurt science centre – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will leave for Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for research in armaments.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than “new heart of Europe”.
If you will. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Headline stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th-century transport technology that acted as the brake hoof of modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to move locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
This is why the mainline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer pose real entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now underway next to the new inter-city route to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies prevailed.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic, not the public enterprise.
From an urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the enlargement of the section are designed for human trafficking which was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - to enormous growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabia project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be lacking for other junction points and congestion in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists a total of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom down here.
But the S21 project is like a brake hoof.
The Rhine Valley route is on its way to becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government Reviewing Judgment on Airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government discussed the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the ban on night air flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Tribunal and which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case where the project to build the northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport would be realized.
Authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air nuisance.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 whether it wishes to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticized the deadline and tried to pressure the government representative to waive the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel calls on the CDU and the FDP to revert to their pre-election promise of banning night flights, otherwise it will be seen as a total breach of a given word.
It's damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, Green Leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's claim that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "lawyery and robbery".
It takes time to conduct an accurate legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its faction on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. banks repay aid
The big U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, are losing their ties to the state.
Bank of America said on Wednesday it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid under the Tarp bailout.
CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid it received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to executives as well as the settlement of higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's coffers, which are well-stocked by the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering getting money from the financial markets in order to free itself from the state’s tutelage.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Eventually, everything happened faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads ZDF’s Berlin newsroom, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm ZDF Intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 Commissioners.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract by five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had voted in favour of Brender's reappointment and seven others had voted against it, and Brender's impeachment by vote was a gross, albeit predictable, failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to reappoint Brender to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief on the grounds that the ZDF's rating of news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, criticizing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it was useless.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national newspaper).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF, first in the news magazine "heute-journal" (journal d'aujourd'hui).
Then his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly information broadcast presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the editorial office berlino.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been voted journalist of the year by Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck did not consider calling for the removal of political figures from the ZDF's oversight committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered to the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of parties, Frey is classified as a left-liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for the students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the burden of exams: a single exam should close the study module chosen.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have been constantly using the fashionable expression: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, stated that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the skids, which significantly impaired the studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if we can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and the necessary room for manoeuvre to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulations will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it will not be until 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not overly burdened and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and higher specialised schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only state to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations department
The Länder and universities have a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for this.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, it will also have to be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that he would like to see the organization of education policy not take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strike, students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful for us", she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder assure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and as good study conditions as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm House of Artists in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, during a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Romanian writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
In 1989, Söllner received the German Language Award jointly with some of the participants.
Enlistment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to withstand enough of the Securitate's intimidation tests."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary entanglements with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own dossier Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the surnames Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been steadily counteracted and slowed down in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005 there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke in a very disdainful way towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and at the end of the day, she was only interviewed once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many unavoidable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, suggests that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Unrest in the Champions League
It seemed that a representative was coming, pulled with four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his merchandise when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be driven into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
'Cause that's when it was gonna start.
The words of the Swiss that we had just committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal fight to not fall back".
The “big job” awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a matter of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Sweepstakes
The eighth round of the Champions League (all-out match 16./17. + 23./24 February/return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant inauguration of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the one who had brought luck, who had conveyed to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, unwavering motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer worked with the healer Babbel.
Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, said: “In football, when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that you would never have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury break, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart have not yet crossed the line, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having four days later a bad wake up in Leverkusen with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't crossed the hard road yet.
The fact that Heldt did not have the heart to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, countered Heldt, in response to Lehmann's bitter criticism.
He had accused management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt pushed through and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer in danger of becoming friends for life these two forty-year-olds.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is to say that without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “largely successful,” Heldt and Lehmann retorted in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championships
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly verbally and gestually provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
The unanimity of the judges prevailed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a unanimous points victory of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko honorably defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he failed the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his loss due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first loss in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the height of his 2.02 meters, by his left side.
Johnson, eleven centimeters shorter who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right-hander.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his strokes rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, to have surpassed with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insults Klitschko by calling him a "ugly zombie" who "isn't really capable".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn't help but tease Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerien Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to reunite the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now considering playing this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left (die Linke) parties are asking the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly attack on two tankers last September, the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report that NATO has and that was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make clear whether the targeted slaughter strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the federal government and whether the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellor has in no way influenced the military’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were growing voices expressing doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The two senior officials' entourage suggests, however, that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked in a letter for a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on the allegations and referred the matter to the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was to be constituted the following Wednesday, to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our darkened rooms, we can unfetteredly indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, one who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, soon has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, in the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, deliriums and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
Its body is in two dimensions with crisp colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged devil creatures, grinning, their mouths bloody, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Thundering, evil voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, actually a loop, and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop comes off.
Let it serve as a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to tear out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived through six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medications for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, people can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrenia is in the middle of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in a lifetime.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains make this kind of cabrioles, is still a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause anyone to momentarily lose perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the affected people have tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the anomaly of the neural system occurs and furthermore the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy drugs very expensive to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For the past ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
Hallucinations are well part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include psychic disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, love grief or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to high school.
A girl who can do anything normal, really.
If there were no images and voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even feel his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man sympathetic.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she's in class, sometimes she can't take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he's invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the board.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too seldom and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the smiling faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten over the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., an only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she called daddy, since she was of age to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experiment," according to Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our overly consciousness-centered world, it is unfortunate that we soon tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, something creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the modification of awakened consciousness by dreaming.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, so as not to sink into the void of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as a safeguarding action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the moment when his conscious leaves for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen immerses himself in a world he created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels back in time . He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture narcotics based on blood.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle that takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even when we are awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very enriching.
The first snow can fall.
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly committed to joining society, Hubert Burda, 69, told Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are capable.
We cannot impose our children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of President and Director General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took over the Treasury sector, that is to say, he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, respectively, and his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have allowed themselves to be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unhappy speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
“I have never had a dream of universal power,” Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of tutor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have set itself El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping center (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food shelf, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" who guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after working our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona to buy electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implantation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements regarding mobility, carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates when it comes to promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero sees a "future of tranquility" for Spain's auto industry, which, he said, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, which was put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and auto companies.
According to the President, this plan helped to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spain by 6% and contributed to a "significant increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of motoring.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
They have an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will you be able to find motorcycles and vintage cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of motoring.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of collector engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in automobile sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Aptitude tests with collectible automobiles and motorcycles will also be conducted on a circuit outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is available only on the 2.0 engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good grade it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cockpit, this compact Japanese car presents a habitability more than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-liter 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed shifting.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3 models are diesel, those who do not make a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words, the one with the largest number of series elements.
As standard equipment, the Lane Change Assistant (RVM) which removes blind spot, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio controls are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements the adaptive bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It stands out in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a great dose of satisfaction.
“First” luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as it is accustomed, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility even to see certain type of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what the iPhone data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately search for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult its mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it should have worked for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The European Commission’s repeated reminders to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of your home country, you are hesitant to use the data, and you are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to monetize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
This is a connected device and you pay at the time of purchase and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime-access purchase option like Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Favorite Color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second, undoubtedly the most important moment of her life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabrics, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heeled green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she wore them loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have had their careers limited due to motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job she has.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unsteady job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, postpone entering life as a couple and early pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 for those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the age gap between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the later they get married and have their first child.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those who completed elementary and higher education were first-time mothers at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, designers and models, of yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, were voted Best Model of the Year.
The ace poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who went through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does so not according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of ignition of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the frights nor the enlightenments.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an emotional invitation to reading and rereading.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: “In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fatal fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers still and always loose."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the end of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent discourse to the locusts."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’
On Joseph Conrad's tomb were engraved the lines of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after the storm the harbor, / rest after war, / after life, tired death delights."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally accepted that she told him that Edward VII was spying on him between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talents surpassed madness.
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it is not to try to conceal Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet trying to do but have Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did that do but aspire to the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our district of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a bloodhound, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog hurting.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is amusing about attacking for free a small defenseless animal that, moreover, was on a leash.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, in the end, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district police station even though we doubt that it serves much and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so they find it fun to mistreat a helpless animal that gives us affection and friendship and keeps us company for free.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial, helmet wear sets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet wear, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as the two structures indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said that this campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products” and affirmed that it contributes to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the use of two-wheeled helmets, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
The good news, however, is that the reference for the comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light trucks) have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the constraints implied by the limitation of bank loans, other factors must be added such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E was of little use.
In addition to individuals, freelancers and SMEs who want to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealership association forecasts a year 2010 similar to the one that is ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now compulsory
As has been the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a deficiency period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The Emergency Brake Assist acts by increasing the brake pressure in an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident were unable to brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the concerned party.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, is postponed until the beginning of 2010.
At GM, however, a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be made in the coming days.
So it’s not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car maker Skyper, supported by Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest precious piece of jewellery, Porsche engineers set off from the Boxster S and managed to slim it down by as little as 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of still gained, to ride five kilos of kilos, to ride five of kilos of sports.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous bends.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: we had not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which at the same time ensures as much safety in corners, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for as long as necessary, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of motor at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at standstill or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we drove with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all the way, while on some corners we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the fashion shows of the house, the singer displays her face of bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or an “It Girl”, she is a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the arduous field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the top of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, was a presage that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but <0xC3><0x81>lava's team chose Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was met with cheers and applause back to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to make himself known as the best player in his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already foreshadowed that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the one of Vitoria that one does not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "the hand of Elias", they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking the lead over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed a few skilful actions to catch the air, and it was at this moment that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, put the counter to a reassuring score of 54.
Avala's team came out to play for everything in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroleague, during a match marked by the absences of players from Unicaja, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream: an aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the internal play of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of a fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams di led.
The Greek team started to operate by showing superiority on both sides, while the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The infielders and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-pointer baskets, drew the 44-32 lead, in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, showed superiority and even managed to equal the difference of the meeting played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to stagger.
The Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-pointer baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because Olympiacos proved relentless when the players put pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, job and car classifieds in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates users' salaries from more than 140,000 jobs available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week the application has been running, the search engine has detected that as a rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly remunerated", explained in a statement the head of products of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data available to Trov<0xC3><0xAC> from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a French programmer 31,059 euros, while a Spanish programmer receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of server, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, head of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note in the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilise.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been practically finalized and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put a bit of sand in the gears, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight towards quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the ECOFIN to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a eurozone country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, on the other hand, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If the European gaps decreased and ours continued to increase, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the research departments to anticipate their stimulus models and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which are returning to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, this sounds like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now “caution is the mother of security”.
Connected sectors
Iberdrola's president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned in front of the sub-commission, eight-closed.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion until 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000 million but to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and it will be necessary to increase the power.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this direction, despite the “punctual” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, because they take some time to reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground-based airport services, will act as the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and at airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market in which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is an estimated AU$1.7 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 million) tunnel.
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the east coast Australian city of Brisbane is the option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The city council hopes to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of the finalists who will be in charge of the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase are facing three consortiums, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth line, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia's largest builders, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, fought against the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatisations, but getting into it is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just gained a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the business group responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and leverage synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The Toll Underground Road, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link, is intended to link the Toowong Western Highway to the outskirts of Kelvin Grove (see map), by a 4-kilometre tunnel, the largest project in existence to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will contribute A$500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane Already Offers Job to Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely profitable, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-owned company will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband fibre optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has sold the 27-story King George Tower project in the city of Brisbane, work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after being commissioned to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million euros.
Alpine consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore wins Renfe advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An App Store
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed in the wake of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has made 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have earned 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth position of the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has distributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to information from UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this split.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, current holder of the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, billed the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of money brought by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (distribution)
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini expects to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 000 euros for each match played.
There is also a win bonus (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw bonus (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the round of 16 receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, versus the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
As a result, a club will earn at least $7.1 million and a maximum of $31.2 million in fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça earned $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are dedicated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four designated places.
The champion of the previous year takes 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% of SOS.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offering (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which will be disbursed over 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives shareholders a 15-day period to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV stated that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, SOS continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and judicial back and forth from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that made her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group chairman.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million SOS to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that over the next few months SOS reveals new embezzlements cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the Salazar credit, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday before the National Court that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina exclusion bid submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion bid presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The oversight body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory leaflet presented, following the amendments applied on December 2nd, to be "sufficient".
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, and could not in any way be transferred before the finalization of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30,000, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions focus on collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphical image of each model is created on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a massively sold model, the job can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles on the road, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centers throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing breakage parts or for calculating the market value or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
From the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for claims assessment, for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came off the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wreckage.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious losses for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for claims assessment, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per annum over the past three years, and it generated a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she undertook her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidented Cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, brokers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer drive, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Garage quotation in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the quote to hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the garage system does not include the estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
